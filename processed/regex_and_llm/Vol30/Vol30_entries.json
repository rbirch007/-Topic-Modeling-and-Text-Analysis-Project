            "content": "Messages for the New Year From Members of the Relief Society General Board IT has been said that nobody worries about Christ and His teachings so long as they are kept shut up in the churches, but that there is always trouble and perplexity if you try to bring them out. As the new year is ushered in and the second century of Relief Society begins, let us as members of this great humanitarian organization resolve to do our part in bringing forward the teachings of the Master, in applying them in our lives, and in advocating them to our fellow men, thus contributing to the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth. President Amy Brown Lyman 66TN Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust;\" (Psalm 31:1). Shall we now, as daughters of our Heavenly Father, rededicate our lives to His work? Nothing we do in His service can be too well or too beautifully done. His spirit, as our constant companion, is our greatest need. It is a privilege to work in His vineyard in any capacity. We were given the Relief Society organization by a prophet of God. Activity in this Church auxiliary helps us to go forward with gratitude in our hearts for our privileges and blessings. May salvation and eternal life crown our earnest efforts. Counselor Marcia K. Howells [ is a great blessing to face life with a testimony of the truthfulness of the Gospelto know that God lives, that life has purpose and direction, and that the relationships of friends and loved ones will continue beyond this life. The work of Relief Society strengthens testimonies and provides abundant opportunity for the application of Gospel principles. Fortunate, Page 5  indeed, are women who are identified with this Society, either as members or as officers. May the experiences of the new year deepen our insight, increase our understanding, and add to our desire to serve our Father and our fellow men. Counselor Belle S. Spafford\nLASTING world peace can be established only through the brotherhood of man, a state of fellow feeling which harbors neither national nor racial prejudices. Relief Society is making its contribution toward this goal. This sisterhood includes women who are of the black, brown, yellow, red, and white races, and citizens of more than a score of nations. Yet each of these is \"sister\" to all other members of the Society, and all are striving to better understand and live according to the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christthe sure path to individual and universal peace. General Secretary-Treasurer Vera W. Pohlman\nWITH almost global war, every member of most families is feeling the impact. Restlessness, adapting to new work, adjusting to a loved one's absence, restricted movements, insecurity, all play their part in intensifying the role that the home needs to play. Changing conditions bring different opportunities to women. The woman of faith and sweet spirit can make her home a haven of comfort in times of trouble. The family prayers, the spoken acceptance of our Heavenly Father as the guardian of all, the understanding heart, the love transformed into servicethe memories of these will fortify our families in the battle for present-day existence. Donna D. Sorensen\nI DESIRE an abiding faith in the Lord, sufficient to sustain and succor me. What I yearn for, I wish for you. The new year, 1943, will be a year fraught with anxieties, but those who trust in the Lord will be assuaged. Present events help us realize how dependent we are upon Him. Pause and think deeply and have hope and vision for your needs. Faith and vision become strong and clear, and sustain those who keep the commandments of the Lord. \"They who have faith in Him will cleave unto every good thing.\" May you have peace surpassing understanding, is my earnest desire. Vivian R. McConkie\nRELIEF SOCIETY is beginning a new year in a new century with the world perilously threatened by the holocaust of evil forces. When we see the human misery and the destruction which follow in the wake of these forces, it makes us feel the preciousness of good; of God's great laws for living together in love. It makes us appreciate our heritagea sustaining peace and the opportunity for organized work in the cause of human uplift. Let us rededicate ourselves to the noble purposes of Relief Society and help bring to the world a charity which is the true love of Christ. Nellie O. Parker\nMESSAGES FOR THE NEW YEAR 7\n\"MAN is at his finest toward the finish of the year; He is almost what he should be, when the Christmas season's here; He is less a selfish creature than at any other time; When the Christmas spirit rules him, he comes close to the sublime.\" Our faith strikes the proper balance between the material and the spiritual forces of life. You have exemplified this thought through your belief in religious principles combined with the doing of noble service. May 1943 bring joys that will remain long in your memory, and may high achievement reward your efforts throughout the new year. Achsa E. Paxman\nTO my sisters of the Relief Societyparticularly those who, like myself, have sons in the armed forces of our countryI send this message: Be of good cheer. Your Heavenly Father loves you and will be mindful of you. Mary Grant Judd\nGREETINGS and best wishes to you noble Relief Society womenyou who will be quietly and faithfully performing the tasks that each day of the new year brings. In these days of confusion and trouble, you Latter-day Saint women are blessed above all others in the world. You have an anchor in your knowledge and testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Hold fast to this precious anchor and you will continue to be sustained and blessed by your Heavenly Father. Luella N. Adams\nTHIS is a day of sorrow upon the earth. As Latter-day Saints, however, we know that we are privileged to be permitted to live during this great Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. We realize that the righteous must suffer with the wicked, but that \"Those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them.\" At this Christmastide let us, as Relief Society members, fill our souls with love for Him who was \"a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\" Let us rejoice \"because he hath poured out his soul unto death\" whereby we may all partake of a glorious resurrection. Marianne C. Sharp\n\"GLORY to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men\". \nThe most soul-satisfying experiences we have in life, especially during these troubled times, are the efforts we make to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ. May this season of His birth bring to each member of Relief Society in all the world a strong and abiding testimony of the mission of our Savior, so that no matter what vicissitudes of life touch us from the outside, within we may have that peace which comes from good will toward men. Leda T. Jensen\nAT the beginning of another year, in a new century for Relief Society, I pray earnestly for Latter-day Saint women everywhere that by the power of the Holy Spirit each may see her course clearly; that each shall do her work with wisdom and in kindness; that each shall be strong and unafraid, preparing herself through faith and knowledge to meet every day in the new year and every situation ahead with serenity and peace of soul. \"For they that have received the truth... And have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived... Shall abide the day.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 45:57) Rae B. Barker\n\"THESE things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.\" In these days of world-wide distress, how grateful we should be for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and for our testimonies of its truthfulness. The mission of the Savior was one of peace and love, and it is through the application of His teachings in our lives that we can meet the problems of this day with courage. Christ's message is expressed in the spirit and character of Relief Society. To be identified with this organization is a blessing. Let us help to further this great cause, \"that in Him we may have peace.\" Anna S. Barlow\nTHIS is the birth of a new year and of a new Relief Society century! The stress of the present stirs us to super accomplishment. The achievement of the past has made us feel our powers. The prophetic urge for organization a century ago is a hundredfold today. May we look forward with the enthusiasm and dreams of youth, but with vision. May we face the new century as we face a new day. May our lives radiate fortitude and inner peace, that we may help bring universal love to the world. This is the birth of a new century for Relief Society. What a challenge to us! Anna Boss Hart\nMESSAGES FOR THE NEW YEAR 9\n\"BLESSED is he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven. For after much tribulation come the blessings.\" Let us as Relief Society members be comforted by these words of our Lord. For even though the past year has literally been a year of tribulation, we as Latter-day Saints have a great many blessings for which to be thankful. May we enter this new year with hope in our hearts and a prayer on our lips that we may so live as to be worthy of the blessings promised to the faithful. Gertrude R. Garff\nEVEN though Relief Society women have been heavily burdened by thick, dark forces, they have not lost their way. They dream dreams and see the vision of a new morning, and a spring come again; their faith is ever fresh. Not necessarily the great or the strong, but the seemingly unimportant women among us are spreading blessings, making small things worthy of eternal remembrance. Theirs is a healing virtue in toil and trouble. Truly their outlook is wider and deeper than the number of years lived or the accumulation of encumbering goods. May our Heavenly Father continue to bless the daughters of Zion. Leona F. Wintch\nTO all of my Relief Society sisters I send greetings, and hope the new year will bring all that your hearts desire in righteousness. Edith Smith Elliott\nAT the beginning of another century of Relief Society, I desire to express my love and appreciation to all the wonderful women who have served so loyally in this organization. May you continue to feel that it is a privilege to live, to work, to sacrifice, to endure, to love; and may you realize that you are instruments in God's kingdom in helping to work out His purposes among men. If you continue faithful, the peace of God which passeth all understanding will be yours; moreover, each of you will be capable of making the circle in which you live better and happier. Pauline T. Pingree\nAT the beginning of this new year our love and prayers go out to our 115,000 Relief Society members. May God's choicest blessings attend you during the coming year and always. \nWhatever the future holds, may you be true to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and may you have the courage, fortitude, and determination to live righteously. By being members of the Church, you are heirs to a precious heritage, and by keeping the commandments of God and conforming to the Gospel teachings and by consecrating your lives to the work of the Lord, you are entitled to life eternal, the Divine gift to mankind. Alice B. Castleton\nMY wish for you, my dear sisters, is that the Christmas just passed will be remembered as a happy one and that blessings may attend you in the new year. To those homes saddened by the loss of loved ones, may our Heavenly Father send comfort and consolation; to firesides where parents, wives, or other beloved ones are bravely carrying on with anxiety in their hearts, may He send patience and faith; and to homes blessed with the laughter of happy children may He send His spirit to protect the household and to guide those who there reside, that loyalty and courage and kindness may reign therein. Priscilla L. Evans\n\"TAKE from out the Old Year only the experiences and achievements that will enrich and make for a better New Year.\" A hundred years of valuable experiences have contributed to the dynamic strength and power of our great Relief Society organization. As the new year approaches, let us greet every day with unfaltering step, with a prayer in our hearts and a song on our lips, with courage and with faith in the fulfillment of the Divine promise that: \"If with all your hearts ye truly seek me, ye shall ever surely find me. Thus saith our God.\" Florence Jepperson Madsen\nI SEND my love and new year's greetings to the members of Relief Society. For many months we have lived in the midst of a world at war, and of necessity we have had to readjust our lives to varied and changing conditions. More than ever before, I believe, we should exert every effort to live our religion and keep the commandments of the Lord. If we do this, we will merit His protection and blessings, and then, whatever the future may hold for us, it will be according to His will. My prayers and good wishes are for your welfare and happiness. Ann P. Nibley"

This involves particularly the heart and blood vessels, since on them falls the direct load of transporting food and oxygen to the body tissues and of removing the waste products and useless heat. Heart failure is predominantly a problem of cool climates. \"Energetic Northerners thus should regard stress of life as a major danger and health hazard, especially after passing the forty-year mark. They should be careful about increasing the stress upon body machinery by lack of proper sleep and relaxation or through the use of caffeine which makes every tissue in the body work harder. I personally feel that overuse of this drug (the active principle of coffee, tea, and cola beverages) is today doing more damage among the active Americans of middle temperate latitudes than any other single factor in life. Over-use of tobacco probably runs a close second.\"\nFrom a General Electric \"Science Forum\" Program, reprinted from Science Digest.\nPRIZE-WINNING POEMS 15\nAward Winners Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest\nTHE Relief Society General Board is pleased to announce the names of the award winners in the short story contest which was announced in the August 1942 issue of Theand which closed November 15, 1942.

Wages, $80 per month. Transportation and one meal furnished. Apply at...\" The newspaper slid from Emily Merrill's hand: \"Wanted... $80 per month....\" Her eyes sought out the worn linoleum, the scuffed chairs, the kitchen curtains, which in spite of frequent laundering refused to stay crisp. She looked down at her thin red hands, idle for once in her lap. How long had it been since she had had money to buy anything she really wanted? Somehow it had taken all they could scrape from the farm to meet expenses and make payments on the mortgage. She sighed. Of course, Jack was working at the plant himself, but he said that every cent they didn't have to use on absolute necessities must go on the debt, now was his chance to \"get out from under\" as he put it. Well, all the more reason she should earn a little. She folded the ad page and put it carefully in the cupboard drawer. Why it was wonderful, that's what it was; it was her golden opportunity. She hummed a tune as she prepared the evening meal. By the time the family was assembled around the supper table, a definite plan had taken form in her mind, but she waited until Jack had finished eating before she said anything. \"Never try to convince a man whose stomach is empty,\" her grand-\nNORMA WRATHALL\nmother had always said. Besides, Jack always read the paper at the meal table. At last he finished his dessert and put down the paper. Emily drew a deep breath, pushed her hair back of her ears, and began. \"I don't like it,\" Jack pronounced emphatically, as she paused for another breath. \"I don't want my wife running around in any workman's cafeteria, waiting on a lot of foreigners and....\" Emily was prepared for opposition, but before she could say anything more, sixteen-year-old Etta inter-\n17\nPage 17\n18\nrupted: \"Don't be so old-fashioned, Dad. All the women are working nowadays. A woman's place isn't just in the home any more, you know.\" He drew his brows together at her condescending tone. This red-headed daughter of his certainly needed her come-uppance for a change. Emily rose hastily to pour oil on the troubled waters. How alike they were, ready to flare at the drop of a match, her sandy-haired husband with his threatening brows, and the girl with her head on one side, staring back at him from under impudently lowered eyelids. \"Of course, Etta, a mother's first duty is to her family,\" Emily said quietly, \"but I'm sure I can manage home and job too, right now; the twins are getting older, and you can help with the housework.\" She was a quiet-mannered woman, with dark hair and soft brown eyes which belied the inner strength her husband had been heard to call stubbornness. By the time she had finished packing his lunch box, with Etta safely out of the way on an errand at the drug store, she had won his consent to her plan. The children were in school all day, and by carefully planning her work, she thought she could manage it. She would arrange for the nine-year-old twins, Billy and Betty, to stay after school with Great-aunt Bessie, a childless widow who had always been fond of them. And Etta could take care of herself, and do a good share of the housework. Emily's agile mind swept on to the systematic planning of her day's work: the breakfast to be cooked early, and served to the children later by Etta; the lunches for the entire\nfamily to be prepared the night before; a hot, cooked dinner in the evening after she came home from work. She could do the washing and ironing and clean the house on her day off. Really, it all seemed so simple. Even Aunt Bessie's lack of enthusiasm failed to dampen her spirits. \"It would be different if you had to work, Emily,\" Aunt Bessie said. \"If that were the case, I'd move right in and help you, if necessary. But I should think that with Jack working.... Well,\" she sighed, \"all I hope is that I don't have one of my headaches on the days the children are here.\" She shook her head dolefully and went on, as Emily thought, \"making mountains from molehills.\"\nEMILY would never forget the day she brought home her first pay check. She sat down and kicked off her shoes to ease her burning feet while she tore open the envelope. Let's seenew linoleum should be the first thing to buy, and some crisp new curtains. And she did want to make a down payment on bed divan for the living room. That old couch was such an eyesore. Her pleasant reverie was broken as the screen door banged, and the twins came bouncing into the room. \"Hi there, mom,\" cried Billy, \"Isn't supper ready yet? Gee whiz, am I starved!\" Billy was always hungry. He grabbed a piece of baker's bread from the box and stuffed it into his mouth. \"Not so much slang, dear. Yes, I'll have it ready in a few minutes.\" Little needles shot up the backs of her legs as she bent her energy to the task. Goodness, it was getting late. \"Say, mom,\" called Betty from the bathroom, where she was washing her hands, \"Aunt Bessie said to tell\nALL THAT GLITTERS\nyou, of course we're welcome to stay there, but Billy'd have to do better. Know what he did?\" She pointed an accusing soapy finger. \"He put two toads in Aunt Bessie's goldfish bowlright in with the fish. 'Magine!\" Betty set her lips self-righteously. \"Yah, an' what if I did, ole Miss Smarty! And mom, know what she did?\" Billy's voice was loud with scorn. \"Kept coming in the house with her roller-skates onright on the linoleum Aunt Bessie'd just waxed. She said....\" \"Oh, children, stop it. Mother's too tired tonight. And Billy, get the broom and sweep up all that mud you dragged in. Betty, help mother set the table. And put away your school things. Oh, dear, Etta's not home from school yet, and it's nearly six.\" Her voice rose in strident irritation. She found herself wondering, a little grimly, if Aunt Bessie still could be heard to wish piously that the Almighty had seen fit to bless her with a family. They were half way through supper by the time Etta came in, tossing her sweater over a chair. Emily looked fondly at her daughter whose red-gold hair framed a piquant face with dancing brown eyes. Etta went at once to the kitchen mirror and began a careful inspection of her complexion. \"Where've you been, Etta?\" asked her father, abruptly emerging from his newspaper. \"Over to Meryl's,\" answered Etta, patting her curls. \"I ate supper over there.\" \"You're supposed to be home when your mother comes. You should help out a little. And who is Meryl?\" \"We were practicing a song and\n19\ndance act for assembly. Meryl's so talented.\" She turned around, executing a dance step. \"Meryl Sisom. You know, Mother.\" \"Some new people who just moved into town. They live over in the old Jacobs' home,\" explained Emily. Jack grunted. \"Humph. Well, you see that you bring Meryl or whoever she is over here to practice so you can help a little. And that's final!\" He brought his fist down on the table with a bang. \"Oh, all right,\" Etta pouted. \"Mr. Sisom makes simply scads of money,\" she went on, with a side glance at her father. \"Meryl has awfully smart clothes. She's getting a new chubby fur jacket. Wish I could,\" she sighed volubly. Jack paddled off to the living room in his stocking feet to finish his nap, muttering that the money some people were spending was ridiculous, and Emily began clearing the table. \"Maybe we can manage the jacket later on,\" she said to Etta who was helping. \"Now hurry, dear, you'll be late for Mutual. It's Tuesday night, you know.\" \"Oh, I'm not going tonight,\" replied Etta, \"Meryl doesn't want to join. She says the things they do at Mutual are childish.\"\nAS the weeks hurried on and the tag ends of work from even Emily's careful planning began to pile up, she tried to grow accustomed to the lint which accumulated under the beds from her one \"free day\" a week to the next. She trained herself not to notice the pile of mending which grew steadily higher on the sewing machine, or the ironing which hung perennially on the clothes' rack. But by the time the short cold days of winter had set in, she began to worry about Betty's frequent colds. Emily knew that Aunt Bessie, really the soul of kindness, nevertheless must have her house neat, and that often the twins played out-of-doors late on chilly afternoons with sweaters unbuttoned and caps left carelessly in the house. She tried to console herself with the knowledge that, as she always worked day shift, she was at home evenings to see that the children went to bed on time, with colds doctored if necessary. Somehow, she had ceased to talk over family troubles with her husband. By the time she had finished her almost endless evening tasks, he was usually asleep in his chair; or, if he was working night shift, he had to leave for work soon after she came home. And, like herself, he seemed too tired for much conversation. The few words they had for each other were merely moments snatched from seemingly more essential things. She would have liked to talk to him about the sealed note addressed to her which fell from Bill's overall pocket one night as she was hanging up the children's clothes. \"Mrs. Merrill,\" it began, \"if possible, will you please see that Billy gets some extra drill on his 'times tables' each evening? Otherwise, I may have to put him in a slower group. Your cooperation will be greatly...\" and signed with the teacher's name. A guilty flush spread over Emily's face. The afternoons and evenings of over half the season had slipped away, and Billy had gone joyfully on, his \"times tables\" cards, sent home earlier in the year, reposing in the cupboard drawer. It was only a few days later that the foreman, Mr. Walters, told Emily that she would have to work night shift for several weeks; he was short of experienced women for the night work. \"It will mean that you'll have to see to getting the twins to bed,\" she told Etta, as they prepared supper. \"Your father is on the afternoon shift, and I have to leave right after supper.\" Etta didn't reply at first, but went on setting the table. \"I've a chance to work evenings and Saturdays down at El Dansante Cafe, waiting on tables,\" she began at last. \"Oh, but Etta,\" Emily's voice lifted in quick concern. \"I don't want you to work down there. It'll be too hard on you. Anyway, I need you here at home.\" She forced her lips to smile. Etta glanced curiously at her mother; and the older woman realized, with a pang, that her daughter suddenly seemed grown-up, an adult who faced her with alien eyes. \"But Mother,\" replied Etta, \"you don't stay home. Why should I?\" In the end, Etta won her parents' grudging consent to take the job; the hours wouldn't be long, and the proprietor promised to see that the girls got home safely. Emily prevailed upon Aunt Bessie to keep the twins at night, and for a while everything seemed to go smoothly again. Emily couldn't remember, later, just when she first began to notice a change in Etta. It may have been the morning Jack told her that their daughter was staying at El Dansante to dance long after her work was finished. \"I've spoken to her about it. But I'm to go on night shift myself, now, so you'd better remind her to get home early,\" he warned Emily. One afternoon, she was roused by\n\nALL THAT GLITTERS\nthe sound of Etta's and Meryl's voices in the kitchen. She glanced at the clock. Only two-thirty; they should still be in school. She frowned as she slid her feet into slippers and pulled her robe around her shoulders. It was hard enough to get a little rest, what with the essential housework lasting most of the forenoon. \"How is it you two aren't in class?\" she asked, opening the kitchen door. \"Oh, we... That is, I... Got a call to go to work a little earlier,\" answered Etta lamely. \"But Etta, you shouldn't miss school for any other work.\" Emily tried to keep the panic out of her voice. She realized, without knowing why, that this had happened before. \"Oh, Mother, don't be silly.\" Etta's young face flushed with embarrassment. She glanced at her friend, who was watching with a little amused smile. \"Well, let's not have it happen again.\" Emily turned back to the bedroom, suddenly conscious of her tousled hair and crumpled robe under Meryl's cool appraising eyes. Funny she'd never noticed before what a bold look the girl had, with frankly darkened lashes and too bright lipstick. It was later that same afternoon that she found Meryl's compact on the kitchen table. Only, as it sprang open in her hand, it contained not rouge and powder, but cigarettes. Etta, questioned about the matter, replied sulkily that she didn't know if Meryl smoked; it wasn't any of her business anyway, was it? The incident was crowded back in Emily's mind by the endless tide of work that pushed her on.\n21\nThen one Friday morning Emily was searching for her coat, getting ready to go home. She hummed a tune, thinking of what Mr. Walters, the foreman, had said as she left her work. \"It's time for you to change back to day shift again Sunday, Mrs. Merrill. You've done so well, I want you to supervise the women workers. Only thing, you may be 'frozen' to your job for the duration, and you'll have to take your turn at the night shift. But it'll mean an increase in pay. Let me know when you come back Sunday.\" Preoccupied, she was at first unaware of what the women on the other side of the rack were saying. \"...Well, if Etta were my daughter, I'd never let her run around with that Meryl Sisom.\" \"...Humph. I guess she's just as bad as the rest. Out all hours of the night. The whole crowd smoking and drinking, so I hear.\" The door banged after the women. Emily stood clutching her coat, their words still ringing in her ears. Of course, it wasn't true! It couldn't be. Not Etta. Then she remembered the cigarette case. The ride home in the crowded bus seemed endless. She found Jack in the kitchen, gloomily cooking his breakfast. Emily sat down by the table and pushed back the stale dishes from last night's supper. If only she could stop shaking while she told him. He said nothing at first, and Emily thought that, oddly, he didn't seem surprised. \"Well, Emily,\" he said gravely at last, \"I don't know as I blame you for trying to earn a little extra. Heaven knows you deserve it, after all your years of going without. But this old 'home ship' of ours needs a pilot at the helm. Go into the living room.\" \"Go into... But what...?\" \"Just go on in. You'll see.\" He pushed back his chair and followed her. For the rest of her life Emily would remember the scenethe early light mottling the rug, the fur jacket flung carelessly on a chair, and on the new divan, the girl lying asleep, still fully clothed, her bright hair spilling over the dark cushions. Emily opened her mouth, but no words came. Her feet were like lead as she walked across the room and bent down. She hadn't known how her knees were trembling until they gave way and she sank down on the edge of the divan. \"Oh, Jack, Jack!\" she sobbed, \"she isn't... That is, I thought....\" \"No, she isn't drunk,\" said Jack bluntly, \"just given out from dancing at that fool place where she works. [ put-my coat over her when I came in from work. Now, don't cry, Emily, she's all right  so far, at least.\" He put his arm around her shoulders, and in an instant the aloofness of the past months vanished in their common bond of concern. Then the rough gentleness in his voice gave way to sudden anger. \"But I won't have it. This is the end. No daughter of mine....\" Etta sat up, rubbing her eyes. \"Gee, what's the matter? Say, I didn't intend to stay here all night.\" \"All night!\" Her father's voice exploded like a storm. \"Don't worry, daughter. You haven't been here all night! Now just you listen to me.\" His angry words beat upon Etta's bowed head. But Emily, still dabbing at her eyes with her wadded handkerchief, had made up her mind at last. She had gone to the hall phone and dialed a number. \"Hello, is this... Oh, all right. Just give Mr. Walters a message for me, please. Tell him that Mrs. Emily Merrill will not be at work... Any more.\" > BEYOND THIS NIGHT Linnie Fisher Robinson - We toiled, beloved, to build a universe secure, Hoping for lasting peace, where we could turn To things of home; nor dreamed our sons should thus endure Days like those other ones we knew. But hate fires burn, Raging across the world; dreams fall apart Leaving but blackened ruins smoldering behind, Bringing despair to try the human heart And tear security from out the human mind. Yet counting all the sands our lives have known, Adding our joy when peace lay on the land, We can but say that life is good; we can but own That, through those storms, we knew that God was in command. Today, that candle, in this dark, shines bright For things our sons shall gather past the night!  Psychological WarfareAn Invisible Weapon Mark K. Allen Psychologist, Utah State Training School WAR is fought today from three principal approaches: the economic, the military, and the psychological. Economic warfare means \"starvation for our enemies and food for our friends.\" It means keeping the enemy from obtaining from anywhere in the world the things he needs to live and to make war on usthe food, the iron, the fuel, and the other materials needed to make and operate a war machine. In an age of mechanization, this type of warfare is very important. In this type of warfare the economicthe Allies had the better of the argument in World War 1. But in this war, the Axis has already reduced through conquest this economic inequality. In the military phase of war, until recently, the Axis seems to have had a definite advantage, because of longer preparation, more thorough training, and a more definite military plan than was the case with the United Nations. Our present mobilization and arms production program, as well as mass air attacks on Axis war industries, are calculated to remove this advantage. The third type of warfarethe psychologicalmeans weakening the opponent through all sorts of tricks designed to confuse, to frighten, to discourage, to mislead, and to divide. It is \"an offensive war waged with intellectual and emotional weapons to destroy the power of morale resistance in the enemy's army and civilian population and to diminish enemy prestige in the eyes of the neutrals.\" An Axis spokesman has said, speaking of psychological warfare, that \"It is essential to attack the enemy nation in its weak spots, to undermine and break down its resistance, and to convince it that it is being deceived, misled, and. Brought to destruction by its own government. 'Thus the people will lose confidence in the justice of its cause so that the political opposition in those nations will raise its head and become a more powerful trouble-maker. The enemy nation's originally solid, powerful, and well-knit fabric must be gradually disintegrated, broken down, rotted, so that it falls apart like a fungus treaded upon in a forest.\" Psychological warfare consists of spreading rumors, false reports, threats, and fears of deadly secret weapons. The channels through which this type of warfare is prosecuted are short-wave radio, fifth column, and rumors planted by agents of the opponents and spread by people uncritically. The type of material spread usually has to do with the strength of the aggressor, the weakness of the defender, and the futility of resistance. An attempt is made to discredit the leaders of the opposing nations. In early stages of psychological warfare, a feeling of Page 23 easy complacency is encouraged by promises of non-aggression. Psychological warfare is referred to today by news commentators as the \"war of nerves,\" the \"strategy of terror,\" \"breaking down the home front,\" \"demoralizing the enemy,\" and the \"war of words,\" or propaganda. With the stepping up of communications, especially the radio, psychological warfare has taken on a new significance in the present war. There is nothing incomprehensible in this type of warfare, and every American should thoroughly understand it and realize how treacherously it can attack, even over many thousands of miles of land and sea. Let us, then, turn to the problem of psychological warfare as practiced against the Democracies, Freedom of ptess, of speech, and of assembly all censored or denied in totalitarian countries as a step in the psychological preparation of their own peoplein democratic countries provide fertile soil in which to wage psychological warfare. The Axis program has three principal aims: (1) to increase conflict and disunity among us; (2) to produce anxiety, fear, and confusion; and (3) to produce apathy and disillusionment. Just as the Axis strategy on the battlefield is to divide and then to conquer, so on the psychological front every possible device is employed to promote disunity among us. The starting points are our own latent prejudices. A few of the most common possibilities are racial, religious, political, national, and economic class prejudices. The efforts of the enemies of this country to stir up racial hatreds are well known, and the nearer their claims fit our prejudices, the more they stir up strife and disunity among us. Religious prejudices are easily aroused by propaganda, and political disunity is readily promoted. Repeated attempts have been made to drive wedges between the United States and Great Britain by saying that \"Britain always gets someone else to pull her chestnuts out of the fire.\" Likewise, Japan points out to China the futility of expecting continued help from allies who have so miserably \"let her down in the past.\" Short-wave radio propaganda from nations at war with us has been particularly directed toward stirring up economic class hatred in America. One of the corner stones of this plan of conquest is the hope that America will collapse from within because of the failure to achieve class unity. Labor is stirred up against capital, and capital against labor. Unfortunately, many people in this country are caught in this trap because of already established prejudices along this line of thinking, which, of course, invites propaganda of this character from the enemies of this country. The second general aim of psychological warfare, after divisions are fostered among the people, is to produce anxiety, fear, and confusion. This is done through pointing out to the victim the invincibility of the aggressor. It consists of a strong military power intimidating a weaker one into submission. The weak are told of the fate of other victims, and are warned of a worse fate, and impressed with the futility of resistance. This \"strategy of terror' has been one of the cruelest weapons of the aggressors. If weak peoples still resisted after due warning, their fate  PSYCOLOGICAL WARFARE was as bad as promised and became a warning to the next victim. Terror is spread by several devices. Civilian bombing is perhaps the most dreadful. Bombs are even made to scream to add to the terror. Incendiaries and delayed-action bombs prolong and intensify the terror of mass raids. The threat of gas bombs has also been used to advantage. Fear has been spread by such tricks as throwing images on the clouds with huge lantern-slide projectors. _ Little does a warring nation care whether its opponents are destroyed by bombs and shells or by psychological methods so long as they cease resistance. Panic and a broken will to resist through actual combat or war work is the aim of the \"strategy of terror.\" If psychological victories can be won, they are usually much less costly than actual military conquests. It is difficult to estimate how much aggressor armies and machines have been spared by psychological victories of the propaganda bureaus. Confusion is spread by circulating all sorts of false news reports. Reports from an opposing nation may say an attack will be made at a certain time at a certain place. Then the place will be changed. When sufficient confusion has been caused, an attack will be made at a wholly unexpected place. Confusion makes organized resistance more difficult. False reports have been circulated repeatedly in this war by nations whose armies were locked in close combat with those of other nations, often successfully dispersing and disorganizing the opposing forces. The third aim of psychological warfare is to promote apathy and disillusionment. The Axis nations have 25 been known to spread much propaganda about some great action, such as the move through the Balkans, then the talk would subside, then it would start up again and die down again. Finally, when everyone had become apathetic about it, they would strike. Japan talked of arbitrating her difficulties with United States up until the very day the attack was made on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese have repeatedly tried to disillusion the people of the United States about the reliability of the reports given them from the Navy as to losses. Japan's technique is to announcesometimes accurately, but often notUnited States' naval losses several days in advance of the Navy's reports. In the battle of Java, 'in which United States losses were severe, Japan announced them with some accuracy many days before our reportthe aim being to make it appear to the people of this country that Japan forced the Navy to make admissions it otherwise would not have made. People should constantly be on guard against this trick, remembering how important it. Is for our Navy to avoid giving information to opposing nations. Another plan is to announce several days in advance the capture of a certain city which is quite sure to be taken later. This forces a denial from the defenders at first, but an admission later when the city is actually takenall of which, it is hoped, will establish confidence in the reliability of reports from the opposing nations and a distrust of reports of one's own nation. Another trick of similar character, practiced by the Axis, is the announcement of false victories for the Democracies. Since we are watchful for good news, we may accept these reports, not suspecting their origin. Later, when reports prove untrue, we become disillusioned and confused. The secretive way in which the Axis powers plan campaigns often lulls us into a sense of false security. Our perilous plight of unpreparedness during the early months of this war was our punishment for years of this weakness. Nations at war with the United States have taken great advantage of our easy optimism and uncritical self-sufficiency. We have failed to take a proper measure of those who are against us, and we have considerably overestimated the security we have in extensive but undeveloped material resources and manpower. Nations opposing this country still feign weakness at times to lull us into this sense of false security and the resulting relaxation of effort. Another potent psychological weapon is the peace offensive. Should the United Nations appear to be really about to win the war, a strong bid for peace can surely be expected from the Axis. The hope will be to lull the Democracies back into a sense of false security, while further preparation may be made to attack them. The Axis nations real- 2 ize how \"pacifistic\" at heart we are, and they are sure to attempt to turn this fine ideal to our destruction. The defense against psychological warfare is as complicated as war itself. Let us hope that some understanding of what it is will aid in our resistance to it. However, civilians can prepare themselves against it in some measure by abiding by the following suggestions: First, keep reliably informed on the daily news. Learn to check habitually the sources of all reports and to evaluate their content according to their source. Second, don't carry rumors. They are the most unreliable source of news there is. Remember, most of them are planted by those opposed to us, and they are meant to confuse and mislead us. Always ask the tumor monger where he got his story. Write it down if it sounds vicious enough, then check it with your civilian defense authorities. You might thus help to find fifth columnists. Don't repeat rumors to your neighbots. Third, speak constructively of democracy and its leaders. This doesn't mean not to criticize, but it does mean to learn to see and to speak of all that is good as well as that which needs correcting. FAITH AND COURAGE The following Christmas message by Nicholas Murray Butler may appropriately be carried into the new year: Christmas Day in this year of grace will be celebrated with civilization at the lowest mark in the history of modern times. This means that more than ever men of light and leading and insight must have faith and courage and hope. They must not and cannot let their faith weaken in those everlasting ideals which must rule any civilized and peaceful world....  Little Stones that Change the Course of Rivers Lella Marler Hoggan O river runs down to the sea N without meeting with obstacles and interferences. And no life fulfills its destiny without overcoming trials and hardships. Yet we chafe under restraint. We resent interference. We become frustrated when sorrow and disappointment disrupt our plans. We feel that life should run smoothly for us. Why should our course be hampered and blocked at every turn? Why should obstacles be forever retarding our progress? Are the very fates discriminating against us? Know this, O friend, neither life nor law discriminate against anyone. We reach the high goals we set out to achieve through the conquest of difficulties. Said J. G. Holland: f We rise by the things that are 'neath our feet; By what we have mastered of good and gain. By the pride deposed and the passion slain, And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet. There is a native in his island home who believes that \"the strength and valor of the enemy he kills passes into himself.\" Symbolically, this is true. We gain strength and development from the conquest of difficult undertakings. Disappointments and delays are often the forces that are preparing. Us to assume responsibilities of importance. We have to meet and overcome trials before we are in readiness to accept the great trusts. Said a great poet: A chance rock in an upland brook, May change a river's course. And yet no rock, No, nor the baffling mountains of the world, Can hold it from its destiny, the sea. Though a stone may divert the stream from its original channel, the water flows around it and makes its way in and out, under and over, past stick arid pebble and deadwood and growing things, on and on until it reaches the surging sea. The picturesque cataract that breaks in sparkling grandeur over a jagged cliff and spills itself in lacy rainbows down a mountain gorge, has gathered the very force that glorifies it from the obstruction that blocked its way. To accept the barriers on life's pathway as impediments to progress is to admit defeat before we have undertaken the journey. All lives are beset by struggle and pain and sorrow. This is nature's way of teaching us the things we need to know. We can't gain experience through the efforts of someone else. Our joys and sorrows must come first hand. We have to work in order to learn to work. We have to suffer in order to gain insight into life. We have to pray in order to learn what prayer means. Real values come only through earnest effort. Intellectual growth and spiritual development are not attained. By listless wishing. Emerson said: \"The law of nature is, Do the thing, and you shall have the Page 27 power: but they who do not the thing have not the power.\" It is not the reward, but the struggle that perfects us. Effort precedes efficiency, and \"joy is in the quest.\" Weare forever consoling ourselves with alibis and excuses for the things we have failed to accomplish. Though we can not explain our weaknesses and failures away, even to ourselves, still we can overcome them and lift ourselves nearer to the ideal that we secretly cherish. Our strength of character is measured by our mastery of the trials we have met. What we think and feel and do puts its mark upon us with indelible fingers. Truly \"the gods we worship write their names on our faces.\" SCOUTMASTER and some members of his troop were attending a rodeo. They stood on the sidelines one morning and watched a procession march gaily down the street. Decked in full regalia, a group of Indians from a nearby reservation headed the parade. Brilliant Navajo blankets covered their horses' backs in lieu of saddles. But nothing 'excited the admiration of the on-lookers so much as the gorgeous war bonnets worn by the old Indian chieftains. These bonnets not only encircled their faces with bright feathers and other trophies, but also extended gracefully down their backs nearly to their feet. At the close of the parade a pompous young man stepped up to one of the Indians and offered him a handful of small coins for his war bonnet. The Indian silently shook his head. \"Doesn't he understand the fellow?\" asked one of the scouts. \"Yes,\" said the scoutmaster, that Indian speaks English as fluently as you or I do. But his war bonnet, like your merit badges, is not for sale. Every eagle feather, every weasel tail, every bear's claw in his bonnet is a symbol of some heroic accomplishment or brave deed. The headdress represents years of effort and is a mark of honor and heroism. He would no more sell it than a king would sell his crown.\" The scouts understood, for each of them was wearing trophies that had cost him long hours of study and effort to obtain. They knew the delight that comes from a worthy achievement. Too often we adults miss the joy of some great accomplishment because we lack the courage or confi-. Dence to begin. We tell ourselves that we are too old or too busy or that we haven't the ability for such an undertaking. We let our fears and misgivings baffle us. We wall ourselves out from privileges we might enjoy. We permit lost opportunities to taunt us, old age to frighten us, ignorance to threaten us. Our mistakes rise up before us like shrouded ghosts in the darkness to accuse and intimidate us. Down with the wall! Banish the spectre! Forget the failures of yesterday! Are we not God's children all? And have we not been assured that He will give us strength and courage according to our need? To the valiant hearted there is no ultimate defeat. There is always a tomorrow. \"True art,\" says Annie Pike Greenwood, \"is in bringing some sort of triumph out of pain.\"\"* Even the Master knew Gethsemane and the cross. But did He not tise to triumphant glory, to stand as the Savior of the world and as a guiding light to mankind forevermore? *Used by special permission of author.  Justice Is a Group Affair Eva Willes Wangsgaard UDITH RAWSON sat on a rag rug on the summer grass, wrapped in the warm, fruity smell of yellow roses, and thought about people and life. It had been long since she had had time to sit and think. But now the examinations were over, and she was graduated, and there was a whole glorious afternoon for her very own. She looked down at her graduation dress made of white lawn with a yoke of tucks and insertion and tuffles of Valenciennes lace; and she remembered how nearly she had come to not having it. That made her recall Edna Silver and Edna's courageous words, and the beauty of those words caught in her throat and tightened her chest; and the whole school year, just past, began to unfold in little scenes like stereopticon views. There was Crossburg the day of the examinations. 'The eighth graders from every town in the county met in the Crossburg Central schoolhouse in three crowded rooms, which had been thrown into one large hall by sliding the great doors which made up their walls. Judith sat in the room at the south where the warm May sun crept through the Venetian blinds. When she looked for Margie, her sister, she found her in the center of the middle room, but no matter how she craned her neck, she couldn't see her brother, Artie. He must be in the third room; and it was around a corner 'so that only a triangle of it was visible from where Judith sat. Every student was tense with excitement. Margie looked calm, except for that habit she had of wiping her perfectly dry lips with her handkerchief; and the pink in her cheeks was too bright. She'd be all right, though, and so would Artie whose thoughts were always slow, but exact. Judith left off thinking of her brother and sister and looked around. 'Then a teacher appeared and began writing questions on the board, and Judith bent to her work of writing answers on the paper that lay on her desk which had been provided for this purpose. All day the examinations went on. A large staff of teachers corrected papers as fast as they were handed in, so by nighttime everyone knew whether or not he had passed. To know was a relief, though some of the kids failed and cried, or even got hysterical. Judith turned her eyes away from that memory. She knew some of them, and it hurt to remember. But there were happier scenes. A girl from Hillsdale got such high marks that they called her a valedictorian, and she gave a speech at the exercises. Maybe on some other graduation day Judith could do that for her class. And here were her white lawn dress and her hat of white chiffon pleated into a bandeau covered with pink for-get-me-nots instead of the blue ones Margie wore. But she almost hadn't got them.... Ever since she had entered Mr. Peterson's eighth grade, she had felt baffled. Mr. Peterson didn't believe in special promotions. Helen 'Tanner was somehow an exception. Page 29 Maybe that was because Mr. Peterson taught her the year before; he had been promoted with the class. Helen was dainty and pretty, too, with, her auburn curls and her gray eyes that smiled flatteringly up at him from under long, dark, curled lashes. Besides she was a whole year older than Judith. \"What do they think I'm running here? A kindergarten?\" Mr. Peterson was tall and skinny with thin, forward-falling brown hair, and he flipped Judith's registration card as he spoke. Judith just stood there fingering the pink ribbon that tied her yellow braids into a swing, and lifted brown eyes to his spiral-like, blue-green ones, which refused to meet hers. He wasn't ever openly cross; he just hid behind soft prickles like wild lettuce, so that the damp hand of caution pressed always on her throat. If she sometimes got too excited and forgot and called out the answer, he would say, \"Grown-up people wait their turns. Only babies yell for attention.\" Then her report card would read: Deportment Good or Fair. Not once had there been an Excellent or a Very Good the way her studies said. Father had talked and talked to her about it, but she didn't know how to change. Father said, \"\"Teachers are always right.\" Last year it had been different, because Mr. Jerome had been kind and wise like Father generally was. Even his hair curled in happy little curls, and his eyes were warm and blue. Last year there had been two classes in one roomone sixth and one seventh grade. Artie had been in the seventh with Mr. Jerome, but Margie had been in another room that was all seventh grade. Judith had been sixth grade then. With two classes in one room there had been more study time, and Judith had found it hard to keep out of mischief. She had sat in one corner among a group of boys. The daily assignments hadn't been nearly enough, so she had coached the whole group in _ arithmetic until they were two months ahead. Then it wasn't fun any more. Billy, Clyde, and Robert had liked it at first, and they were good sports, too. They didn't care if Judith was a girl, but worked with her anyway. But they lost interest. ONE day Judith had finished the last word in Self-Help by Samuel Smiles, which Mr. Jerome had lent her. There wasn't a single thing to do. Clyde was whittling a slender stick into a \"guinny.\" \"Want it, Judy?\" he had whispered. \"Thanks. It's cute.\" Judith began to tap the tiny stick with her ruler. Mr. Jerome had sat down at his desk to check a lesson. Judith had slid into the aisle and had given the toy harder and harder taps. It had leaped and fallen with a small, dropped pencil sound. Suddenly it had gone sailing through the air and had lit, plop, on Mr. Jerome's book. Judith had slipped instantly back into her seat and seized a book. Mr. Jerome had picked up the offending toy and had held it before his face. \"A \"guinny' is a dangerous plaything, even on the school ground,\" he said. He pressed his forefinger up and down on one sharp point. Then, \"Here, Judith. Dispose of it.\"  JUSTICE lS A GROUP AFFAIR If he had pricked her with the \"guinny,\" Judith couldn't have been more startled and ashamed, nor could she have jumped more quickly. She had walked to the desk, though, and, taking the \"guinny\" from his outstretched hand, had dropped it into the wire wastebasket. The incident was closed, and Mr. Jerome hadn't marked down her report card. He knew how hard she tried to hold herself back. But afterwards Judith discovered that there were interesting texts in the seventh grade desks and _ borrowed one often. And she listened to seventh grade discussions instead of getting into trouble. Even that proved embarrassing, though. One day when Mr. Jerome was directing a seventh grade geography class he asked, '\"\"What article necessary in manufacturing is entirely absent in Brazil?\" The class had sat too still. Hands were raised. Then up went Judith's hand. Mr. Jerome's kind eyes looked tired. Maybe he was wondering what the child could want now. Maybe he was weary because the seventh graders were unprepared. But he decided to settle Judith first. \"What is it?\" he asked. \"Coal,\" answered Judith. Two rows of seventh grade faces came up at once and stared at Judith. Three rows of sixth grade students quit studying and giggled. Judith dropped her hot face on her desk and felt the cool, smooth touch of the maple top. Mr. Jerome raised his brows. \"Where did you learn that?\" \"T read it.\" \"Well, you're correct,\" he said, No 31 and was still for a long moment. Then he went on conducting class. At promotion time Mr. Jerome had decided harder work would be better for Judith. So he had jumped her into the eighth grade. But Mr. Peterson didn't look at things that way. He resented both her energy and her youngness. He resented all of her. This year all three of the Rawson children were in the same room. Judith hung around Margie too much, but there were no other companions in the room. She missed last -year's kids. Some of these kids were oldseyenteen and eighteen. They stayed at home so often to work in fields and orchards. Artie often stayed home to look after things while Father was away, but Judith and Margie seldom missed a day. So Margie was just right. It was Judith and Artie who were out of place. And there was Edna Silver who was an orphan and lived with a cross aunt. The other children in the room told tales about how much work she had to do each day before she came to school, and lots and lots of days she didn't get there at all. Judith had often helped her with lessons at recess, because Judith was often lonely and didn't know how to mix with these new kids. Edna learned well too. Some of the other big girls couldn't learn even when you tried your hardest, because they couldn't forget that they were older than you. But Edna wasn't like that. She thought of the work, not herself, and stuck with Judith no matter how often Judith had to go over a thing. And she was eighteen, too. She was a nice girl, but too old to play with Judith. Lizzie Shaw was Margie's playmateshe and Helen Tanner. But Lizzie didn't want Margie's little sister along and often made it plain that what she said was not for Judith's ears. Helen Tanner was all right when she and Judith studied together. But she acted just like Lizzie when it was recess time and she didn't need her. School wasn't nearly so much fun as it had been last year. But Mr. Peterson puzzled Judith more than the pupils did. When the class was in diagraming, Lizzie, Margie, Helen, and Judith read the text and went ahead almost without trouble. But if they ever got stuck, Mr. Peterson was always busy. It didn't matter much, though. One of them always found the help they needed by reading the book again. One day, Mr. Peterson was putting a diagram on the board. He made a mistake. Lizzie's hand went up. She was like that. Things were never correct or incorrect to Lizzie. They were right or wrong, and must be set straight. So she told Mr. Peterson. He was quiet and went very pale. Finally, \"How would you do it?\" he asked. Lizzie drew the correct diagram. Judith, Margie, and Helen nodded. Mr. Peterson said, \"Well, that's right, too. Just be careful to have a reason for your diagram.\" Lizzie opened her mouth, then shut it tight and plunked into her seat, and the lesson went on. There was a lot of work to be done in the eighth grade and Judith liked it, but she wasn't happy. She felt choked. There were too many ways for Mr. Peterson to show what he thought of special promotion students, like asking Judith if she didn't need a rest when you could hear the younger students out at recess. Once after he had said that, Judith stood by the steps not feeling like joining in any of the games at all. Edna Silver had come up and put her arm around Judith's shoulder. \"Don't let it bother you, Judy,\" she said. \"You're all right. Keep right on going. You're the kind that can. I can't, but part of me will follow you however far you go. Now run and play.\" Judith smiled and ran. HEN the report cards for the third term came out, Judith  opened hers eagerly. She'd tried to be good, and maybe Mr. Peterson had noticed. But she held it down and stared at the wall. The subjects weren't so bad. You either got your lessons and passed your examinations with high marks or low, but deportment was different. That was the teacher's opinion. Now it was lower than ever and stood out like a stump in the snowP for Poor. Father would be disappointed and so would Mother. They had said that she couldn't have a new dress for graduation if she didn't improve in behavior. It was no use to talk. Teacher was always right. \"It didn't matter how much you learned if you didn't know how to live,\" Father had said.. Judith thought and thought. She could find no reason for such a low mark. She had \"called out\" a few times, but so many, many times she had succeeded in holding back even when she was the only one who wanted to answer! She guessed Mr.  JUSTICE IS A GROUP AFFAIR Peterson was right. Kids shouldn't get ahead of themselves. Margie would have her new dress now, and Judith would have to wear an old one, if they let her go to the exercises at all. Still, maybe it was a mistake. Hope struck a small match. It didn't seem fair, and teachers did sometimes make mistakes in copying, just as students did. She'd go and ask him. Anyway, she might find out what was wrong so that she could improve the last term. If she did, maybe she could have her new dress after all. But Mr. Peterson wouldn't notice her. Other children were around his desk, and he kept taking new ones even after Judith was sure that it was her turn. When she tried to get attention, Mr. Peterson said, \"Don't push like a baby.\" There was nothing to do but wait. She pushed the tears back so that she wouldn't be a baby. She felt an arm around her and looked up into Edna Silver's quiet eyes. Edna took Judith's report card, glanced at it, and handed it back. How long she had been listening and watching, Judith didn't know. But now she was speaking to Mr. Peterson. \"What's wrong with Judith's behavior? I think she's a good little kid. I've learned a lot from her.\" She sounded defiant, but she wasn't. She was just earnest. That was evident by the light in her fine, grey eyes; and something in her voice made Mr. Peterson listen. Silence stretched like an elastic band between them, then snapped, and Edna continued, \"Children are a sacred trust. They have a right to 33 fairness and to understanding.\" A change came over her face. \"We can't play favorites. I know one who wouldn't get such good marks if she didn't borrow Judith Rawson's eraser so often during tests.\" Helen Tanner was putting her books into her sack. She gave Edna a swift look, and hurried out of the room with one book still in her hand. Judith stood fascinated. Mr. Peterson had the same look he had on his face the day Lizzie corrected the diagram. But Edna stood tall on her convictions, and the color flamed high in her cheeks. She wasn't fighting for Judith alone. \"Ahem! Ahem!\" Mr. Peterson cleared his throat, but found nothing to say. Edna hadn't finished. \"Whether you play fair with Judith or not isn't just between you and the child. Justice is a group affair, and we older students expect to see justice done.\" Mr. Peterson looked out into the room, then dropped his eyes and went on making little fishes with his pencil on a blotter on his desk. Judith looked up. Almost every older student in the room stood in a little group in the rear looking at Edna with approving eyes. Artie was among them, straight aad tall, with his large blue eyes almost violet with concern, and those crooked little lines above his nose deeper than she had ever seen them. Judith choked and tears spilled over and ran down her cheeks. The o. Der kids were wonderful! And all this time that she had been concerned only with herself, they had known and cared.

PHILOSOPHY in a New Key: a Study in the Symbolism of Reason, Rite, and Art is a new scientific book of worth and originality by Dr. Suzanne K. Langer of Radcliffe College. One challenging idea in this book is that \"man can adapt himself somehow to anything that his imagination can cope with.\" EDITORIAL Vol. 30 JANUARY, 1943 No. 1 A New Heart and a new Spirit CAST away from you all your: transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit....\" The end of a year is a favorable time to \"cast away... Transgressions\" and seek to make \"a new heart and a new spirit,\" for there is encouragement in viewing the events of the past year as being behind one and regarding the new year that lies ahead much as a book, unmarred and unmarked, containing three hundred and sixty-five blank pages on which will be written defeats or triumphs, retrogression or progress. It is true that many of the events which may affect one during the coming year arise through no volition of the individual; but the pages of this yearbook will glow with beauty or be drab and even uglynot because of events that may transpire, but according to the manner in which the individual meets these events. The most luminous page may shine with faith developed from experiencing one of life's darkest tragedies. This life is a time of testing and proving whether or not one is a true Latter-day Saint. \"I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.\" To write a yearbook worthy of a Latter-day Saint, one must continually study the Gospel and seek to live a life in accordance with its teachings. The more one studies, the more clearly do one's own faults and even transgressions cry out for correction. In this inward searching, the first examination may well reveal failings manifested in the home in one's daily life. Is there need of more patience and understanding for loved ones, or is there the need for more firmness and discipline? Is a resolution wanted to make every minute count? Brigham Young once said \"that our time was all we could call our own, we should have to give an account of it, and therefore we should use it to the best possible advantage in assisting to build up the Kingdom of God on earth.\" On the other hand, should more time be devoted to the home the better to guard it, should more care be given to train one's children more perfectly in the laws and principles of the Gospel, in having family prayers and in studying the scriptures? One may also resolve to more frequently visit the sick, seek to bring cheer to the afflicted and comfort to the sorrowing, and to more faithfully attend to one's Church duties. But perhaps it is wisdom not to undertake too many resolutions at once, although one does naturally continually strive to improve in many ways. One or two resolutions faithfully kept are better than many abandoned before the keeping has become a habit. It is well, finally, when making a resolution to live and plan for the day alone and let the tomorrows wait until they in turn become today. The present moment is the only time that must be lived. If then as each succeeding year advances, resolutions are made and kept looking toward improvement and development, these resolutions will, in time, serve as stepping stones to a better life; and the yearbooks will glow ever brighter illuminating a character striving to obey that great dictum, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\"M.

These suggestions are of special importance during the present war conditions because of possibility of disaster or epidemic, and because of curtailment of hospital and nursing service for civilians, making it necessary to depend to great extent on home nursing. Relief Society visiting teachers, when making regular visits for the month of February, will leave at each home a leaflet on these matters issued by the General Board of Relief Society.\nFirst-Aid Kits for Families: The leaflet contains a recommended list of first-aid supplies for families, not only those families in war risk areas but families in all other areas as well, for use in case of accident or household emergencies. It is recognized that it may not at all times be possible to procure all the articles listed, but it is suggested that families provide themselves with such articles and partial quantities as can be procured. Many families doubtless already have on hand most of the articles in the recommended list of supplies and need only to take stock of the supplies which are on hand, to assemble them in a receptacle which is easy to carry and keep them in a safe and readily accessible place. The leaflet includes excerpts, reprinted with permission from the American Red Cross First Aid Text Book, describing the various articles recommended for the family first-aid kit and explaining their uses.\nDemonstration of First-Aid Supplies at February Work-and-Business Meeting: All Relief Societies in war risk areas, and all others desiring to do so, are requested to conduct a demonstration of the articles recommended for the family first-aid kit. This demonstration is scheduled for the February work-and-business meeting, unless otherwise announced, and where possible is to be conducted by an individual acquainted with first-aid practices who will explain the use of the various articles and demonstrate the making of triangular bandages and splints, so that these articles can be made in Relief Society work meeting (or in the home) and added to the family first-aid kit along with articles which are purchased.\nRelief Society Home-Nursing Supply Chest: The General Board recommends that every ward Relief Society wherever located arrange to accumulate a supply of articles ordinarily needed for home nursing in case of sickness or disability, such articles to be either rented or loaned according to circumstances of families using the supply. Believing that many families have such articles which are not in use and which they would be willing to give or lend to Relief Society supply chests, particularly at the present time when some articles cannot be procured by purchase, a survey form accompanies the leaflet to be distributed by visiting teachers in February upon which families may specify such articles as they would be willing to give or lend to such a home-nursing supply chest.\nAdequate Bedding for All L. D. S. Families: During the past few years, many stake and ward Relief Societies, at the suggestion of their respective Church Welfare Committees, have conducted bedding projects to encourage and assist all families within their boundaries to be well equipped with good beds and bedding. The Relief Society now urges all families to make a follow-up check of their bedding facilities and make an effort to provide themselves with any additional bedding which is needed. Comfortable and adequate bedding is particularly needed at this time because of curtailment of the fuel supply in many communities due to exigencies of war and because of the need for protecting the health of every individual during this war period while nursing and medical facilities and supplies are limited. Because of present conditions with respect to labor, materials, and war production, only those bedding supplies which are currently needed should be procured at this time. Suggestions have been issued to ward Relief Societies for cooperative plans whereby members supplying their own materials may have quilting done at Relief Society meetings.\nWomen Advised to Take Courses in First Aid and Home Nursing: The General Board of Relief Society again advises that all women able to do so take the Red Cross course in first aid or home nursing, or both. Many Relief Societies are arranging with the local Red Cross chapter for these courses to be given in the wards, and members may make inquiry of their local Relief Society president or their local Red Cross chapter concerning such courses.\nOther Recommendations Applicable Only in War Risk Areas: The General Board recommends that in war risk areas, ward Relief Societies procure ward first-aid supplies to be kept under jurisdiction of the Relief Society in ward meetinghouses. A recommended list of such supplies for these areas is contained in a bulletin dated December 29, 1942 and sent to all stake, ward, and mission Relief Society presidents. This bulletin also recommended that in war risk areas at least one woman in each stake be called to prepare herself as a Red Cross first-aid instructor who will conduct first-aid classes for the convenience of the women in the local wards of the stake. In these areas an additional survey is to be made by the visiting teachers in February to ascertain supplies which families would be able to make available, upon call of the ward Relief Society president, for use in case of emergency entailing temporary housing other than in homes. Accordingly, in sections considered by stake or mission authorities to be war risk areas, a special survey form for this purpose will accompany the leaflet to be distributed by the visiting teachers during the month of February.\nPetitions on Informative Labeling\nThe General Board of Relief Society is cooperating with the National Council of Women in petitioning the Office of Price Administration to require that goods bear informative labels clearly stating what an article is, of what it is made, how it is made, what service it will give, and how it should be cared for. All Relief Society members in the United States can help achieve this desirable goal by signing petitions which will be explained and circulated at a Relief Society meeting.\nSuggestive Program for Sunday Evening, March 7, 1943\nIN a letter dated April 26, 1942, the First Presidency designated the evening meeting of Fast Sundays for use by the auxiliary organizations. At a meeting of the general executives of the auxiliaries, the Fast Sunday evening meetings of November and March were assigned to Relief Society. Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore consult their respective bishops and ask for permission to arrange for a Relief Society meeting on the evening of March 7, 1943. This is a very favorable Sunday on which to present a Relief Society program, coming as it does on the first Sunday of Relief Society anniversary month. The General Board submits the following suggestive program for use on this evening. Wards desiring to plan their own programs are at liberty to do so. Much of the material for the suggested program is drawn from The American Citizens Handbook recommended for use in the social science course, \"What 'America' Means.\" The objective of the program is to show that the cause of freedom is the cause of Christ. Democracy finds its fullest expression in the roots of religion, which has ever emphasized the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. For democracy to reach its highest fruition, our society must include that larger liberty preached so eloquently by the Hebrew prophets and by Jesus. (American Citizens Handbook, page 16.) As planned, the program will honor the boys in the service, their parents, wives, and children. It is suggested that seats be reserved at the meeting for the honored families and that Relief Society presidents consult their respective bishops concerning a display of pictures of ward members who are now in the service, if such pictures are not already on display in the chapel. The flag of our nation should also be prominently displayed. Mimeographed copies of the program for use by the audience would add greatly to the success of the program. In order to insure a large attendance, it is recommended that visiting teachers on their regular February visits invite all ward members to be present at this meeting and that advance announcements of this meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members should particularly be urged to attend. The patriotic theme of the program is timely and should appeal to all, both old and young. The program will be more effective if regular ward announcements to be made at the meeting are made preliminary to its presentation.\n\nNOTES TO THE FIELD\nI. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. X.

Benediction.\nSuggestions for Presenting the Program\nThe above program may be presented with or without special scenic and lighting effects and with or without special costumes according to the facilities of the various wards. The opening remarks by a member of the ward Relief Society presidency should briefly welcome those in attendance, point out the theme and objective of the program and explain that it is the outgrowth of one of the Relief Society courses of study of the past year, \"What 'America' Means.\" She should also announce that the families of ward members who are in the service are being honored, giving the number of ward members who are in the service. It is suggested that the person who offers the invocation be advised in advance that the theme of the program is patriotic. The foreword to be given by a young woman (in patriotic costume if desired) is adapted from \"You, at This Moment,\" The American Citizens Handbook, page 4, as follows: You, at this moment, have the honor to belong to a generation whose lips have been touched by fire. The human race now passes through one of its greatest crises. New ideas, new issues, a new call for men to carry on the work of righteousnessall these have come and are daily coming to you. When you are old, however, memory brings back this moment to your minds, let it be able to say to you \"That was a great moment.\" This country in its crisis called for men and women of faith in God, of patience in service, of charity and of insight. I responded to the call however best I could. I gave myself to the Master, to the cause of humane and brave living. For the talk \"The American Way of Life is the Christian Way of Life,\" see The American Citizens Handbook, page 6, et passim; also an address by Elder Stephen L Richards, Deseret News, Church Edition, June 6, 1942. The following excerpts from the address by Elder Richards are particularly appropriate for use in this talk: This is a Christian nation. America had its inception in Christian principles and doctrines; it was founded, nurtured and built by Christian men and women, Christian concepts have been incorporated into its basic laws and institutions and its loftiest ideals and purposes are but the expression of Christian virtue. We hear a lot of talk nowadays about the American way of life. What is this American way of life? Is it anything other than the Christian way of life? If it differs essentially, if it contemplates something other than Christian liberty under law, then I'm not so enthusiastic to have my sons fight for it. I believe, however, that you will find on analysis that this American way of life we prize so highly is in reality a Christian concept.... Restraints are supposed to be imposed by self-discipline rather than exterior force. People are free to make their own choices, endowed with a freedom that can be curtailed or limited only as may be necessary to assure the same freedom to all.... I make the assertion that we cannot hope to obtain that great spiritual support which we now so sorely need except upon the basis of truly Christian living. I think this to be so necessary because, as I interpret the issues at stake, we are really fighting a religious war. I think that our armies on the battlefields of the world and our civilian army here at home are really fighting to preserve the cause of Christ in the earth. I know they may not be conscious of such an objective. I wish they were. Since this talk is to be followed by the singing of \"Recessional,\" it would be well for the speaker to refer to what usually happens when men forget their dependence upon God. She might even quote from the \"Recessional,\" saying that it is to be sung following her talk. Following the rendition of the \"Recessional,\" the talk \"Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Preserve the Cause of Freedom,\" is presented. In this talk it is suggested that the speaker explain how our Church has always stood by our\n\nNOTES TO THE FIELD\ncountry in her hour of need. Reference could be made to the Mormon Battalion and the history connected with it. At this point, someone in the background representing President Brigham Young might speak, first apparently addressing Captain Allen in these words: You shall have your battalion, Captain Allen, and if there are not young men enough we will take the old men, and if they are not enough we will take the women. Brigham Young might next appear to address members of the Mormon Battalion as follows: I want to say to every man, the constitution of the United States as framed by our Fathers was dictated, was revealed, was put into their hearts by the Almighty, and I tell you it is as good as ever I could ask for. I say unto you, magnify the laws. There is no law in the United States or in the Constitution but I am ready to make honorable. Following the statements by Brigham Young, the speaker might continue, pointing out that at the time of World War I, President Joseph F. Smith said: I believe it is righteous and just for every people to defend their own lives and their own liberties, and their own homes, with the last drop of their blood. I believe that the Lord will sustain any people trying to preserve their wives and their children from the ravages of war. At the conclusion of the talk \"Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom,\" the \"Credo\" by Elias Lieberman, The American Citizens Handbook, pp. 70-71, would be very effective read by a soldier, if one is availablethis to be followed by a patriotic number from the Relief Society Singing Mothers. The talk \"Our Boys As Missionary-Soldiers,\" to be given by a young woman, could explain what some of the ideals are that can be fostered in service men by the girls at home. The following brief excerpt from a letter recently written to a mother by her son who is serving his country overseas might be read: I wish it were possible to tell you in person how much I depend upon my Heavenly Father for guidance and inspiration; how each day the Gospel means more and more to me. During these distressing times and periods of temptation the principles which you and father have taught me through deeds and words are always before me, and they serve as a real stabilizer. I feel I am able to be tolerant without compromising; to segregate the good from the evil, for I understand the source. Humbly I feel that through the help of the Lord and you dear ones at home I am able to be an influence for good. For the short tribute \"Our Flag,\" which should precede the singing by the congregation of the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" see the short article, \"Respect the Flag,\" The American Citizens Handbook, p. 151. During this tribute, the flag, which has been in evidence during the evening, might be spotlighted and an electric fan used to make it wave as the congregation sings our national anthem. At the conclusion of the singing, while the audience remains standing, the same young woman who gave the foreword should give the conclusion, as follows: America first, not merely in matters material, but in things of the spirit. Not merely in science, inventions, motors, and skyscrapers, but also in ideals, principles, and character. Not merely in the calm assertion of rights, but in the glad assumption of duties. No flaunting her strength as a giant, but bending in helpfulness over a sick and wounded world like a Good Samaritan.... Not in treading again the old, worn, bloody, pathway which ends inevitably in chaos and disaster, but in blazing a new trail along which, please God, other nations will follow, into the new Jerusalem where wars shall be no more. Some day, some nation must take that pathunless we are to lapse into utter barbarismand that honor I covet for my beloved America. The American Citizens Handbook, p. 61. The speaker then looks heavenward as she voices this prayer by the poet Longfellow: Lord, let war's tempest cease, Fold the whole world in peace Under Thy wings. Make all the nations one, All hearts beneath the sun. Till Thou shalt reign alone, Great King of Kings.\nPublication of Leads for Class Leaders Balance\nTHE, pp. 640, 655, announced that a new book, \"Leads for Class Leaders,\" to be issued by the Relief Society General Board, would be ready for use sometime during the fall, 1942. The General Board sincerely regrets that due to unavoidable circumstances work on the book was delayed, making publication impossible during the fall of 1942 as announced. It is the present plan of the General Board to issue the book in time for use during the next educational year, which begins in October 1943.\nIt is suggested that no closing song be sung and that the benediction follow Longfellow's prayer. The estimated time required for the presentation of the complete program as outlined is one and one-half hours. It is suggested that wards desiring to give less time to the presentation of the program either omit the talk, \"Our Boys As Missionary-Soldiers,\" or combine its message with the talk, \"Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom.\" The tribute to the flag might also be eliminated in the interest of time. Suggestions for appropriate musical numbers will be found in The, pp. 868-870.\nElder Stephen L Richards Lectures Over KSL\nBEGINNING Sunday evening, December 27, 1942, and continuing each Sunday for several weeks, Elder Stephen L Richards, of the Council of the Twelve, is delivering on the regular Sunday evening broadcasting time of the Church, over radio station KSL, at 9:15 M. W. T., a series of lectures entitled \"The Church in War and Peace.\" The broadcast originates in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Special vocal music is under the direction of J. Spencer Cornwall, director of the Tabernacle choir, with Alexander Schreiner, Tabernacle organist, at the console of the great organ. This broadcast should interest and value to all Church members inasmuch as the lectures give Gospel interpretations of present-day situations.\nNOTES TO THE FIELD 43\nMessage of First Presidency Published In Booklet Form\nTHE message from the First Presidency delivered in the Tabernacle, Saturday, October 3, 1942, during the opening session of the 113th Semi-Annual General Conference of the Church, has been published in convenient booklet form, size 3x4\", and distributed to Latter-day Saint families throughout the Church, to missionaries, and to Latter-day Saint men in the service. The General Board expresses its appreciation to the First Presidency for making this important message available in such convenient and attractive form. Relief Society members are urged to read the message carefully and thoughtfully, and it is suggested that mothers discuss it with their families. The counsel and guidance given on drink and the Word of Wisdom, chastity, parenthood, unity, and the war are of vital importance to us today. The message to the men in the armed service, and the blessing, commendation, and comfort given to officers and members of the Church are of inestimable worth.\nRelief Society Presidents to Encourage Use of New Book, \"Recreation in the Home\"\nRELIEF SOCIETY presidents are requested to cooperate in the distribution and use of the new book \"Recreation in the Home\" recently published by the General Boards of the auxiliary organizations of the Church. Coming at a time when the use of automobiles is restricted and when other conditions incident to the war make it necessary for us to be resourceful and economical in our recreational activities, the book meets a present-day need. It contains many new games and many old favorites, and is fertile in suggestions for many other types of recreation. Games and other activities included in the book can be played and enjoyed by large and small groups of all ages, with a minimum amount of equipment, work, and expense required. To aid in the distribution and use of the book, ward Relief Society presidents are asked to announce its publication at one of the regular Relief Society meetings, preferably a work-and-business meeting, calling attention to its content and its value for use in the home and for larger groups. It is also recommended that the book be used in planning Relief Society parties or other social activities, thus demonstrating its value. Relief Society officers and members should not only know that there is such a book, but should own and use it. \"Recreation in the Home\" may be purchased from the Relief Society General Board, 28 Bishop's Building, or from the general offices of the other Church auxiliary organizations. Price 25 cents, postpaid.\nThe Mormon Handicraft Shop\nTHE Mormon Handicraft Shop is your shop, established to help Relief Society women. Are you supporting it? There are three ways in which you can help the Shop: First, the Shop must have articles to sell, such as pillowcases with lovely white crocheted edges, quilts, attractive aprons, exquisite clothing for babies, useful hot pads, fine handkerchiefs, etc. When articles are beautifully made, of suitable, good material, and of desired colors, they will sell readily. The Shop can now use many such articles. You can encourage women to make these lovely articles to be sold. Have you found that lonely sister or the one who is homebound and have you encouraged her to make some lovely and useful article? This interest would mean a great deal in her life. How about the sister who needs to help herself financially, who would appreciate having a little extra money of her own to spend? This is made possible by sending her articles to be sold. The second way in which you may help the Shop is to buy there whenever possible. When you need a distinctive handmade gift, reasonably priced, it can be found at the Shop. Remember, this is a day of advertising. Never miss an opportunity to tell your neighbors and friends about Mormon Handicraft. Third, you may help the Shop by paying the annual membership fee of $1. Many of our wards are paying this yearly fee, and in so doing are helping to support this worthy project. May we add your ward to our list of Mormon Handicraft supporters? We feel, especially, that wards in close proximity to the Shop should support it in every possible way.\nAuxiliary Leaders Protest Picturization of Smoking and Drinking\nUNDER date of November 14, 1942, the following letter signed by the general presidencies and superintendencies of the Church auxiliary organizations, was sent to Mr. Will H. Hays, of the nation's film industry, protesting the picturization of smoking, drinking, and vulgarity in films. These auxiliary leaders represent a total active membership of 747,688 men, women, and children. The increasing use in motion pictures of tobacco and alcoholic beverages is alarming, and it is in recognition of the effect of this upon youth that the auxiliary leaders ask that an effort be made to eliminate these items from the films as far as possible:\nMr. Will H. Hays 28 West 44th Street New York, New York\nDear Mr. Hays:\nFor some time the auxiliary organizations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been alarmed at the increasing use in motion pictures of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. By the constant presentation of drinking and smoking on the screen the wholesome resistance of youth and childhood is being broken down.\nNovember 14, 1942\n\nNOTES TO THE FIELD 45\nDrama is one of the cultural fields with which we have full sympathy and in which some of our organizations work extensively among the young people. We know of the immense influence of dramatic representation on the human mind. It is conceded that in some situations the use of tobacco and liquor might legitimately give a truer picture of life, although our own standards lead us to ban these articles from the stage. Incidentally, we have been pleased to see that plays do not suffer thereby. A talented group of professional and amateur players recently put on \"The Man Who Came to Dinner,\" without smoking, drinking, profanity or vulgarity, and without lessening, strange as it may seem, the humor in the slightest. We know, therefore, that a great decrease in the use of tobacco and alcohol on the stage can be accomplished if there is the will to do it, and we earnestly petition you to set standards that will reduce these harmful things to the minimum. Although most states, perhaps all, have statutes forbidding the use of tobacco or alcoholic drinks by minors, yet whenever a drink is taken in a play, or cigarette lighted, especially by actors who represent to the young patrons almost everything desirable in life, a definite impact is made on their resistance to observe the law. The liquor and tobacco interests know the power of such example and of course do everything to extend the use of these articles in the business of the play. It is most unfortunate that the great institution of motion pictures, with its immeasurable educational and character forming influence, should be used to promote this evil. That is truly a breach of its great trust. Our responsibility to childhood and youth besides giving them the spiritual training to prepare them for eternal life, includes the endeavor to help them be healthy, temperate, upright and clean. Alcohol and tobacco, with their degenerative effects endanger both objectives. We commend you for all the fine things that you have donethe elimination of profanity, for example. And now in the name of our youth and of all American youth we appeal to you, who bear so much moral responsibility in this phase of our recreational life, to look into this situation and answer to your conscience as the good American that you are. We believe the wrong done to impressionable young people will tend to debauch individuals and bring about a poorer grade of American manhood and womanhood. Those who love America will support you in the action we plead with you to take.\nGENERAL PRESIDENCY OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S RELIEF SOCIETY, By Amy Brown Lyman, President, Representing 115,015 mothers\nGENERAL SUPERINTENDENCY OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION, By George D.

            "content": "Point Rationing\nNote: The following information from Justin C. Stewart, Utah State Information Officer, Office of Price Administration, is of interest to Relief Society women:\nWITH the introduction of \"point rationing\" early in 1943, consumers must learn to shop with a new kind of currencyration points. This will not take the place of our accustomed money and tax tokens, but will be in addition to them. When buying, the housewife must know the ration point value of each commodity as well as the money value. Point rationing will be accomplished through the use of War Ration Book No. 2 which will be issued to all consumers shortly after the first of the year. It will be used to ration groups of related or similar commodities which can be substituted for one another in actual use. It will not replace the straight coupon system for such goods as sugar, because that system is more appropriate for standardized commodities used by everyone and of which there is a large enough supply to give everyone a usable share. Cereals might be used as an example of how point rationing will work, although there is no present plan to ration them. Oatmeal, cornflakes, wheatflakes, and branflakes are related commodities which can be substituted for one another in the daily diet. Suppose that there were a shortage of branflakes and the Government was to try to ration them as it rations sugarthat is, an equal amount for everyone each month. Because of the shortage, and because branflakes would thus be allotted to people who don't buy them regularly at all, the result would be a very small share for each individual, just\nPage 46\na few ounces a month, too little to do anyone any good. This also might mean a buying rush on cornflakes by those who usually buy larger amounts of branflakes than would be allowed by the ration. Or it might mean a rush to buy oatmeal or wheatflakes, and thus the supply of these cereals might quickly disappear from the stores, and many people wouldn't get any cereals at all. This illustrates that while dividing the supply of any one of the cereals would give each individual only a small equal share, dividing the total supply of all of them would give each individual enough for his basic cereal needs. If we were rationing cereals under the point system, all types could be purchased by using the same ration coupons. However, each kind of cereal would be given a point value. A low-point value would be given to the more plentiful items and a high-point value to the less plentiful ones. Each person would then be allowed, for example, 48 points to buy cereal during the month. Suppose cornflakes are plentiful and are assigned a value of one point per pound; the supply of wheatflakes is a little less plentiful and is assigned two points per pound; and branflakes very scarce, hardly available at all, are assigned eight points per pound. In this example, the individual could buy two pounds of cornflakes and surrender only two of his 48 ration points. On the other hand, if he purchased two pounds of branflakes, he would have to surrender 16 of the 48. Thus consumers will be discouraged from buying the high-point value commodities that are scarce and will be encouraged to buy the low-point value commodities of which there are large supplies. The Government will be able to change the point value from time to time according to the supply of the various commodities, thus insuring the fairest possible distribution of goods. Ration Book No. 2 will have stamps of two colors, blue and red. One color might be used for meat. The other color for some other group or related commodities, such as cereals. Each stamp will have a letter of the alphabet marked on it\"A\" through \"Z.\" These letters will be used to indicate the time in which the stamps should be used. There will be four \"A\" stamps, four \"B\" stamps, four \"C\" stamps, etc. One of the \"A\" stamps will be marked with the figure 1; one of them, the figure 2; one, 5; and one, 8. The numbers will indicate the point value of the stamps. Thus the four \"A\" stamps, which will be numbered 1, 2, 5, 8, will have a total point value of 16; the four \"B\" stamps a total point value of 16; the four \"C\" stamps a total point value of 16, etc. Suppose the A, B, and C stamps are allowed for the first month of cereal rationing. We should have a total point value of 16 \"A\" stamps, 16 \"B\" stamps, 16 \"C\" stamps, a grand total of ration points for the month of 48. The following month, stamps marked D, E, and F might be used, thus giving a 48 point ration for the second month. In this way, each consumer may \"spend\" his points to buy any of the items in the point ration group in any way he likes, but when he has \"spent\" all of his points for the month, he will not be able to buy any of these items until the next ration period. Those who choose to buy commodities having a low-point value will get more for their ration than those who choose to use up their points on high-point value commodities. When buying, therefore, consumers must ask themselves not only whether they can afford the dollars and cents price of rationed commodities, but also whether they can afford to \"spend\" their points in that particular way. This will require careful budgeting of both money and ration points. At the same time, planning must not be too rigid. There is no possibility in wartime of guaranteeing that the storekeeper will have all of the favorite standbys on hand at all times. There may be a smaller supply than usual or a larger demand than was expected. It may be found that some of the favorite items in a group are not \"best buys\" in ration value. In that case, in order to get the most out of her family's point allotment, the housewife will find it desirable at times to buy \"second choices.\"\nTHE SUCCESSFUL WAY\nDoing an injury puts you below your enemy; revenging one makes you but even with him; forgiving it sets you above him.Benjamin Franklin.\nFROM THE FIELD\nVera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer\nRegulations governing the submittal of material for \"Notes From the Field\" appear in the Magazine for June 1942, page 420.\nRELIEF SOCIETY CENTENNIAL OBSERVANCES\nJuab Stake (Nephi, Utah)\nFOLLOWING is an account of the centennial observance of the Juab Stake Relief Society, of which Chloe N. Bailey is president, which appeared in the Nephi Times News: \"The observance of the Relief Society centennial was held in local wards of Juab Stake on March 17. Through the courtesy of the General Board of Relief Society, a centennial gift was presented to each ward in the form of a phonograph record containing centennial messages from President Heber J. Grant and President Amy Brown Lyman. \"The North Ward Relief Society planted a tree in accordance with the recommendation of the General Board. A short program was given in connection with the tree-planting on Tuesday afternoon, March 17. Talks were given by A. E. Smith, bishop, and Robert P. Garrett, counselor. The record sent by the General Board was played. The tree, a cutleaf weeping white birch, was planted on the North Ward Relief Society grounds. \"On Tuesday evening, a pageant, \"The Gate Beautiful\" was presented by the North Ward Relief Society to members of the three Nephi wards. The pageant was under the supervision of President Mary E. Boswell and was directed by Ellen\nPage 48\nGarrett, Fern B. Garrett, and Minnie J. Smith. Music was furnished by the Monson sisters of American Fork, a quartet consisting of Afton Lambert, Emma C. Cannon, Eugene Beck, and Nello Sudweeks, which sang appropriate selections, and solos were given by Verda Beck and Emma C. Cannon. Mrs. Douglas Jones was the reader, and members of the cast were Relief Society women of the North Ward. The pageant was a most creditable performance. \"The Nephi Ward observed the centennial with an appropriate program which consisted of an account of the first Relief Society organization given by Birdie C. Jones; humorous selections by Florence R. Winn; a duet by Susannah and May Wilkey; cello solo, Vivian Hoyt; tribute to former presidents of the Nephi Ward Relief Society, given by Priscilla Wilson. Each president was presented with a flower. A reading, 'I Am Proud' was given by Mrs. Douglas Jones. Mrs. Laura B.

EVANS, second counselor in the Relief Society presidency of the North Idaho Falls Stake, submitted the following report of centennial activities in this stake: \"We wish to report to you some of the centennial activities of our stake. We presented the cantata 'Resurrection Morning,' by B. Cecil Gates, as a stake unit of one hundred Singing Mothers. The chorus furnished the music for our stake conference. The cantata, conducted by Mrs. O. D. Hendrickson with Mrs.. J. O. Mellor as accompanist, was presented Sunday afternoon, March 15, 1942, in the stake tabernacle. It was very well rendered to a large audience. We had members participating from eleven of the twelve wards and branchesone branch being sixty-three miles away. We held a prayer meeting with all chorus members before the concert, and then presented cach member with a golden boutonniere, and the chorister and organist with a blue and gold corsage. \"At this meeting we displayed the scrapbooks made by eleven of our twelve wards and branches. In their arrangement the books showed much originality, artistic ability, and historical worth. A volume of Gospel Standards by President Heber J. Grant was presented, to the centennial chairman of the Ucon Ward as a prize for the best scrapbook. \"On Monday, March 16, we left daffodils with twelve Latter-day Saint mothers, reminding them of the centennial observance the next day and of the time of the radio 51 broadcasts from Salt Lake City. From the interest shown by these mothers, we certainly felt well repaid for the calls we made. \"On March 17, the Idaho Falls Fourth Ward held a special centennial program with President Luna Norton and counselors in charge of arrangements. Under the direction of Mrs. Jacob H. Trayner, with Mr. Trayner as reader, a pageant in twelve scenes, entitled 'Mothers and Daughters of the Ages,' was presented with special costumes and lighting effects to a full house. Mrs. J. O.

Sister Evans stated in a subsequent letter of November 23 that, \"We are very thankful to Brother Woller, the temple gardner, and Brother Irvin T. Nelson, Church landscape architect, for assisting us and granting us this privilege. We had had stormy weather for several days, but the morning [of November 4] was clear, although cold. The program was short but well attended by approximately 100 people, and everyone seemed thrilled with the occasion. After the ceremony, the members who wished to go were escorted through the temple. We surely felt that the efforts were worth while.\" Seattle Stake (Seattle, Washington) HE Bremerton Ward Relief Society reported its centennial birthday party, held March 17, 1942, as follows: \"The ward chapel and recreation hall were decorated in the Relief Society colorsblue and gold. The opening feature of the celebration was a tree-planting ceremony, at which time we planted a tree on the chapel grounds. Appropriate remarks were made by Bishop John J.

Dalton was president, presented a unique centennial program using letters, tableaux, and a cantata to depict \"Relief Society Beginnings\" and \"A Century of Achievement.\" Helen Cottam, secretary, reported the observance as follows: \"Letters narrating 'Relief Society Beginnings' were written for the occasion by one of our members, Isabel Vine Broadbeck. They were tead by a reader dressed in a typical 1842 costume, who was shown writing them in her Nauvoo home. Be- tween the reading of each letter, our Relief Society chorus, assisted by Lola Brimley, director, Mary Rex, accompanist, and Jessie Turner, soloist, sang selections from the cantata 'Messengers of Mercy,' by Gladys Rich and Minnie D. Warner. In conjunction with the readings and the rendition of the cantata, tableaux in costume and with stage properties were, presented to show scenes related to the letters.\" An original poem, \"A Century of Achievement,\" written by Alva Wilson, was given by two women, Emma Gardner representing Emma Smith, and Ruby Armstrong representing a modern Relief Society president. This was given just before the final tableau depicting \"Women of Service in 1942.\" Estella C. Dalton, former president, is now president of the Los Angeles Stake Relief Society, and Frances Willardson is president of the Beverly Hills Ward. South Sanpete Stake (Manti, Utah) CLARICE B. TUTTLE, former president of the South Sanpete Stake Relief Society, submitted a newspaper report of the very successful centennial observance held by the three wards of Manti, and also a report from the three Ephraim wards. The Manti Messenger contained the following account of the Manti celebration: Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday [March 15, 16, 17, 1942] were gala days for the Relief Society organizations of Manti, culminating years of untiring and ceaseless effort directed toward building a bigger and better organization, an effort which has been crowned with glorious success. Officers and teachers have worked energetically to prepare the three-day celebration in honor of the centennial observance of the L. D. S. Relief Society. Their efforts resulted in one of Manti's most elaborate celebrations, enjoyed by old and young of the entire community. Commencing Sunday night, a cantata, \"Resurrection Morning,\" written by B. Cecil Gates, was presented to the general public by the Singing Mothers of the three wards, under the direction of Cleo Christensen, with Mrs. Louise Hulme at the piano. Mrs. Bernice B. Keeler and Mrs. Leona F. Wintch were the readers. Before the cantata, Mrs. Clarice B. Tuttle... Gave a speech of welcome. A salute to the Relief Society was given by President Leland E. Anderson, the response by Mrs. Merle Poulson, president of the Center Ward Relief Society. Mrs. Viola Tatton was in charge of decorations. Monday afternoon a reception and program was held in the Center Ward Chapel, with so many in attendance that benches and chairs would not suffice. A fashion show depicting styles from 1842 to 1942 was directed by Mrs. Ruby K. Riddle.... Mrs. Alfreda Nielson was in charge of the music and refreshments. Monday night a married folks' dance was held in the Armada. It was one of the biggest dances of the year, and one of the most enjoyable. Many of the dancers came in costumes, which varied in kind and color from the humble overall to the dignified Prince Albert, and from the house dress of years gone by to the colorful gown of the gay nineties. Tuesday morning, a throng of people visited the temple, where the Singing Mothers furnished the music. Tuesday afternoon and evening in the Manti Theatre a pageant, \"By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them,\" written by Moroni Smith of Richfield, was presented. Mrs. Ada Dyreng was in charge of the pageant, assisted by Mrs. Edna Allred and Mrs. Blanche Garbe. Taking part in the pageant were sixty people. Singing for the pageant was done by the Singing Mothers directed by Mrs. Cleo Christensen. The three-day Ephraim observance was also very successful. The first session was held Sunday evening, March 15, in the tabernacle, under the direction of Anna Rasmusson  NOTES FROM THE FIELD 35 FIRST EPISODE OF PAGEANT, \"BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM,\" MANTI WARDS, SOUTH SANPETE STAKE RELIEF SOCIETY Leona F, Wintch, Relief Society General Board member, is in front row, center, representing Emma Smith; on her right is Winston Crawford representing Joseph Smith e FOURTH EPISODE OF PAGEANT, \"BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM,\" INCLUDING SINGING MOTHERS WHO SANG FOR THE PAGEANT of the stake board. Seventy-five Singing Mothers wearing white blouses made an impressive sight when they sang \"Resurrection Morning.\" They were assisted by Melba Armstrong, conductor, and Phylis Armstrong, accompanist. 'The stage setting was appropriate for the rendition of the cantata. The bishops of the Ephraim North, South and West Wards offered the prayers and also assisted backstage. Under the direction of Olivia Anderson of the stake board, general chairman, the activities on Monday afternoon featured a relic display, modeling of old hats and costumes of long ago, dancing of the minuet, and singing of old-time songs. \"Sister-cake\" with its cardamon flavor, peppermint candy, dried apples, and punch were served by ladies in costume. Tuesday, March 17, members from the Ephraim West Ward attended the morning session at the Manti Temple. In the afternoon, three inspirational episodes were enacted under the supervision of Vera Erickson of the stake board. They were: first, dramatization of the organization meeting of Relief Society; second, an episode emphasizing the importance of attendance at Relief Society, in which was dramatized the story of two young women who never 'found time to support Relief Society; and, third, a pantomime of nations coming through a membership arch. After this episode, candles on a centennial cake were lighted. This cake was made of seven pounds of popcorn. According to the report from the Ephraim wards, the costs incurred in conducting this three-day celebration were very low. Anna Rasmusson is now president of the South Sanpete Stake. CENTENNIAL CANDLE-LIGHTING CEREMONY Brigham City Third Ward Relief Society, Box Elder Stake  DEPARTMENT Sheology and Sestimony \"Articles of Faith,\" By James E. Talmage Lesson 15 The Book of Mormon (Continued) Article 8: \"... We also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.\" (Tuesday, April 6, 1943) Condensation of Chapter XV of Articles of Faith by Talmage (This condensation is placed in the Magazine in the hope that it will result in more class members familiarizing themselves with the lesson.) The Authenticity of the Book of Mormon The authenticity of the Book of Mormon constitutes our most important consideration of the work. Announcing to the. World the message of a departed people, written by way of commandment, and by the spirit of prophecy and revelation, this book is entitled to the most thorough and impartial examination. The Latter-day Saints base their belief in the authenticity of the book on the following proofs which will be discussed: 1. The Nephite and the Jewish scriptures are found to agree in matters of tradition, history, doctrine, and prophecy which the separate records treat. In a careful comparison of the prophecies of the Bible with corresponding predictions contained in the Book of Mormon, each of the records is corroborative of the other. 2. Ancient prophecy has been literally fulfilled in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Enoch (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:59- 62), David (Psalms 85:11), Isaiah (Isaiah 45:8), and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37), as well as other prophets knew and prophecied of the book. Ezekiel 37:15-17, reads: \"The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions [signifying the Bible]: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions [signifying the Book of Mormon]: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.\" 3. The internal consistency of the Book of Mormon sustains belief in Page 57 its divine origin. The parts bear evidence of having been written at different times and under widely varying conditions. The book maintains consistency throughout; no contradictions, no disagreements have been pointed out. 4. Among the most conclusive proofs of the authenticity of the book is that furnished by the demonstrated truth of its contained prophecies. The predictions contained within the Book of Mormon may be classed as (a) prophecies relating to the time covered by the book itself, the fulfillment of which is recorded therein; and (b) prophecies relative to times beyond the limits of the history chronicled in the book. Prophecies of the first class named are of minor value as proof of the authenticity of the work; nevertheless, to the conscientious reader the genuineness of the book will be made apparent in the literal realization of the numerous and varied predictions relating to the fate, then future, of the people whose history is given in the record. Prophecies of the second class are numerous and explicit. Many of them have special reference to this last dispensationthe Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. Among the most remarkable Book of Mormon predictions incident to the last dispensation are those that relate to its own coming forth and the effect of its publication amongst mankind. Joseph's great prophetic utterance is to be found in part in II Nephi 3:11-13. The literal fulfillment of this prophecy in the bringing forth of the Book of Mormon through Joseph Smith is well evidenced. That the new scriptures would be rejected by the Gentiles was known by Nephi, who recorded this: \"A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.\" (II Nephi 29:3; read the entire chapter.) 5. The archeology and ethnology of the Western Continent contribute some corroborative evidence in support of the Book of Mormon. Among the most significant of the discoveries respecting the aboriginal inhabitants of the land, are the following: (a) that America was peopled in very ancient times, probably soon after the building of the Tower of Babel; (b) that the continent has been successfully occupied by different peoples, at least by two classes, or so-called races, at widely separated periods; (c) that the aboriginal inhabitants came from the East, probably from Asia, and that the latter occupants, or those of the second period, were closely allied to, if not identified with, the Israelites; (d) that the existing native races of America form a common stock. It is very apparent that each of these discoveries is fully sustained by the Book of Mormon record. Let not the reader of the Book of Mormon content himself with such evidences as have been cited concerning the authenticity of this reputed scripture. There is promised a surer and more effectual means of ascertaining the truth or falsity of this volume. Like other scriptures, the Book of Mormon is to be comprehended through the spirit of the scripture, and this is obtainable only as a gift from God. But this gift is promised unto all who shall seek it. Then to all let us commend the counsel of the last writer in the volume, Moroni, solitary scribe who\nsealed the book: \"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with\n59\nreal intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\" (Moroni 10:4-5)\nLESSON PLAN\nLesson Aim: To prove the authenticity of the Book of Mormon\nSuggested Material Outline\nI.

Aztec\nSuggested Method Outline\nI. It is suggested that class members who are capable and who do research well, be assigned, at least a month in advance of presentation, the five major sections of this lesson outline. In making such assignments, it is suggested that the class leader bear in mind the following procedure: A. Enough time should be spent with the class member assigned the task to make the assignment very clear. If necessary, the assignment should be written out by the class leader, and then the member should be given time to ask questions concerning her assignment. B. Class leaders should make the time limit explicit. This is very important if the lesson is fully covered in the time allotted. C. Class leaders should be responsible for seeing that material for use in the preparation of assignments is available. D. Some follow-through on the assignment should be made by the class leader to check on the progress of each assignment, and this should be done before the actual day of presentation. II. Class leaders should allow themselves time to summarize the major points of the lesson in order to make a unified whole and to increase learning. Part of this summary could be gathered from the class by skillful questioning. (Consult any book on teaching methods for help on how to formulate questions. If a blackboard is available, it would be helpful to list thereon the major points covered in the lesson.)\nReferences Roberts, B. H., A Comprehensive History of the Church, Vol. I.

No one can attain his highest usefulness, happiness, or intelligence, who injures his body by improper living. In the Doctrine and Covenants there are many revelations regarding the human body and its importance as an instrument of the mind. \"The spirit and the body,\" we are informed, \"are the soul of man.\" (Section 88:15) And in another place we read that the spirit manifests itself through the body. Therefore, the physical condition of the body either facilitates or hampers expression of the spirit. Such things as food, clothing, proper housing and living conditions\nare \"given to strengthen the body and enliven the soul.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 59:19) Section 88:124 gives instructions for the maintenance of the body. \"Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean;... Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.\" Then there is the Word of Wisdom (Section 89), which offers specific instructions: tobacco, \"strong or hot drinks,\" excessive meat eating are \"not good for man;\" while fruit in the season thereof is good for the use of man, and wheat is specially \"for man.\" Obedience to these teachings is attended by certain blessings. There are also revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants which indicate that the care of the body is a religious duty. The attitude of the mind and the emotions one cultivates have an effect on the health of the body. This fact was enunciated by Jesus and it\n*Discourses of Brigham Young, page 283, makes clear that President Brigham Young regarded tea and coffee among the hot drinks referred to in Doctrine and Covenants, Section 89.\n61\nfinds ample justification, if any is needed, in what we know from the study of the body. Christ assures us that fear, anger, hate, with kindred emotions, are a source of injury. He puts it theologically: \"Thou shalt not be angry with thy brother.\" But science gives us the reason. Says Herbert Spencer, in his Data of Ethics: \"From biology we learn that no act should be committed or thought entertained which weakens the body, for thereby the human being is rendered unfit for the duties of life.\" Obedience to the laws of health, both those revealed through religion and those discovered by man in his search for truth, express our faith in the teachings of the Church so far as concerns the sanctity of the body.\nDiscussion\n1. What should be the attitude of all citizens toward community health?\n2. In what ways can women cooperate with the civil authorities in maintaining healthy conditions in the community?\n3. Discuss Doctrine and Covenants 88:124, with regard to proper rest; also Gospel Doctrine by Joseph F. Smith, page 461.\n4. What are the physical effects of fear, anger, hate?\n5. What are the blessings promised those who obey the Word of Wisdom?"

It is easier to keep clean than to make clean. Dirt wears things out, whether they be fabric, wood, plaster, leather, or fur. Good materials are entitled to good care. Waiting until they are very dirty before cleaning them means added rubbing and scrubbing that wears things out as much as does the dirt that is ground into them in the first place. While it is necessary to keep things clean to conserve them, it is also necessary in cleaning them to use the process best suited to the material or fabric involved. Some fabrics take kindly to mild soap and water, while others require dry-cleaning agents. The difficulty today is in knowing the material with which one is dealing. Rayon, the versatile fiber, is woven into a variety of fabrics; and since these fabrics are so extensively used, it is important to have a knowledge of their care. Some rayon fibers lose their strength when wet; others are dissolved when cleaning agents are used; and some are melted by the use of too much heat. The cleaning of any material containing rayon fiber depends on the nature of the weave as much as the fiber itself. Rough or creped surfaces should usually be dry cleaned. If material can be washed, the kind of soap, the temperature of the water used, the handling while wet, and the length of time given for drying are important items to remember. All fabrics of rayon, silk, and wool, whether used for clothing, upholstering, curtains, draperies, or rugs, require a mild soap, luke-warm water, little handling with no harsh rubbing or wringing. A long time is required for properly drying all of these fabrics except pure silk, which dries quickly. The amount of soap required will depend upon the harshness of the water, and whether or not a softening agent is used. Trisodium phosphate is a good detergent. Sheer fabrics when washed should be rolled in a soft absorbent cloth, such as a turkish towel, to absorb the excessive moisture, and they should be ironed with a warm iron while damp. Some fabrics, because of fineness, construction, or color, respond best to dry cleaning, and if done at home, extreme care should be taken in the handling of articles and in the selection of the cleaning agent to be used. Whether laundering or dry-cleaning method is used, stains should be removed from the article before the whole article is cleaned. The proper time to remove stain is when it is fresh. Air, heat, and water may change the character of the stain and make it difficult to remove, if it can be removed at all. It is much easier to remove a stain without injury to the fabric if the kind of stain is known. Most ordinary stains on tub-fast, washable materials, such as cotton or linen, can be removed with warm water; or in case of fruit stain, boiling water poured from a height. Stubborn stains, like ink, require special treatment.* Clothing and fabric articles that can be handled easily should be brushed often and regularly. Dust and dirt work into the meshes of the weave and cut the threads. The best time to brush clothing is immediately after wearing. Underwear and stockings should be washed often; fibers deteriorate with perspiration and body acids. In most homes, rugs and upholstery usually get a bigger share of the wear than other articles. To avoid some of this wear, they should have a quick daily cleaning, rather than to allow dust and dirt to work into the pile. A more thorough cleaning should be given weekly. The best cleaning implements to use are a vacuum cleaner and a carpet sweeper. Sweeping with a broom, especially against the pile, will further embed the dirt, and may tear or damage the soft, wool nap. Greasy spots and soil cause dirt to stick, which, in turn, dulls the colors. A good nonflammable cleansing fluid will brighten colors and remove spots. Some kinds of rugs and upholstery can be shampooed with safety if a thick jelly-like suds is made of neutral soap and applied with a brush using a circular motion. The lather should be scraped off with a dull broad knife, and then wiped off with a damp, clean cloth wrung out of clean warm water. This process should be repeated as many times as is necessary to remove all soap and soil. As little water as possible should be used. Articles should be allowed to dry thoroughly before being used. A thorough cleaning occasionally by an expert will prolong the life of such furnishings. Hard shaking of small rugs breaks the backing and unravels the ends or fringe. A rug laid on a smooth surface or over a pad not only wears longer but is easier to keep clean. If slip covers are used, they should be removed often enough for cleanliness and to make sure that moths do not lurk beneath them to feast on the precious fabrics of the davenport or chairs. Tablecloths, luncheon cloths, and\n*See America's Housekeeping Book, Chapter 25, p. 323.\nnapkins are made of various kinds of fabrics, such as cotton, linen, rayon, silk, and Cellophane. Linen and cotton, if white, can stand hot water; if colored, warm water should be used in washing. They should be washed quickly, rinsed thoroughly and, if white, dried in sun; if colored, they should be dried in the shade. Grass linen is stiff and should be handled carefully so as not to break the threads. Cotton and linen require a hotter iron in pressing than do other fabrics. Mats made entirely of Cellophane only need to be wiped with a damp cloth to clean. A bit of starch in the rinsing water will give cotton a gloss when ironed and keep it clean longer. Never use starch for other materials, especially linen. If ironed linens are rolled on a pasteboard or paper roll rather than folded, they keep fresh, clean, and wear longer. The folds in larger cloths should be changed occasionally to prevent wear along the line of the fold. Bedding should have its share of care. A clean, soft, but firm mattress, fluffy clean blankets, and clean sheets are inviting and help one to rest well. Soiled bedding is not nearly so warm as clean bedding. Regular airing and sunning of the mattress will keep it fluffy. A mattress should have a cover that fits snugly and that can be removed for washing. The rules for washing table linen apply also to bed linen. Over-washing of woolen blankets mats the\n63\nnap and causes harshness and shrinkage. Blankets will be fluffy and soft if dried out-of-doors on a mild, breezy day. Sheets hung straight and smooth on the line, dried, and then carefully removed and folded, need\n64\nnot be ironed other than to press the hems. Occasionally the wood of furniture needs a thorough cleaning with thick soap suds to remove the grime and smoke that collect and dull the beautiful surfaces. In modern heated homes, furniture gets too dry, which sometimes causes it to crack and come apart. If washed carefully, a small part at a time, without much water, wiped thoroughly dry with a soft cloth, and polished with a good furniture polish rubbed with the grain of the wood, the wood of most furniture will look like new, and the little bit of water used will help restore the moisture drawn out by overheated houses. Floors often become loose and squeak from the same cause. Floor surfaces should be kept clean, and the finish, whether oil, wax, paint, or varnish, should be well applied. This prevents the floor from wearing, whether it be wood, linoleum or tile, and is particularly important where floors receive great\nwear. Too frequent and too generous use of soap and water has a tendency to deteriorate rather than preserve some finishes. Each kind should have its own treatment. Paste, liquid or self-polishing wax are sometimes used too generously. When there is an accumulation of this wax, it should be removed; the floor should be thoroughly cleaned and new wax applied. Painted walls may be cleaned with a mild soap and water, or a water softener or solvent and water. They should be wiped well after washing. Long even strokes should be used when wallpaper and calcimine are cleaned with the dough-like preparations now on the market. Rubbing back and forth makes streaks and embeds the dirt in the paper. The main point to remember in cleaning all materials and articles is that they should not become too soiled.\nNOTE: America's Housekeeping Book, sections one, two, and three, pp. 131-335, contains a wealth of material on this subject."

Introduction\n2. Abraham\n3. Moses\n4. Eve\nIntroduction\nCarlyle says: \"There are great personalities who march through history with voices like clarion trumpets and something like glittering swords in their hands.... Contact with them warms and kindles the mind.\" By association with superior personalities, either in the flesh or through the medium of literature, we take on some of their greatness. Many people feel that the Bible has more eminent characters than any other book of literature. This is one of its claims to greatness. Frank S. Mead draws attention to this fact in his book 250 Bible Biographies. Henry T. Sell includes only twenty-one men in his Studies of Great Bible Characters, but his selection point definitely to outstanding men who have given us ideal and moral uplift by the ideals, struggles, and achievements of their own lives. He writes of Abraham, the man who dared to trust God; of Isaac, who accepted the challenge of obedience; of Joseph, the dreamer whose dreams came true; of Moses, the leader and law-giver of a nation; of Joshua, the courageous man with a hard task; of Saul, the man who abused his opportunities; of David, the self-conqueror who became king; of Job, the man of undeserved suffering; of Isaiah, the world prophet and statesman; of Daniel, the man who made advantage out of disadvantage; of Luke, the man who broadcasted the Gospel's good news; of Paul, the man who bettered city conditions; and many others. Mr. Sell describes his characters as men who were \"the outstanding and strategic leaders in their own times, the men who molded the thought and directed the action of the ages\n65\nin which they lived, but who today are even more influential, for they realized, were profoundly influenced by, and worked enthusiastically for ideals and principles which still lead us on.\" They had their faults and made mistakes, for they were very human; but above every other desire, they had that of bringing the kingdom of God on earththis was their glory. We can learn from them today by seeing how they met their problems and worked them out. Mr. Sell says, \"They were hardy adventurers on the sea of life who, despite violent storms, came safely to port with rich cargoes. To examine how they did this will richly repay our study, for in their successes they rise above their nationality and every age.\" Though Mr. Mead gives no more than his regular two or three hundred words to his thumb-nail sketch of Jesus, and Mr. Sell does not include Him at all, we know that both would give him first place among Biblical characters. Hundreds of books have been written upon His life and mission. Most of them have recognized His divinity, though a few have attempted to understand him as a man alone. Of such writers, Harry Emerson Fosdick says in The Modern Uses of the Bible, p. 272: \"Of all foolish things, I think nothing is more foolish than, looking back over our race's history and discerning amid its tragedy and struggles this outstanding figure spiritually supreme, to minimize him, to tone down our thought of him, to reduce him so that we can be like him. Rather let us exalt him! If God be not in Jesus, God is not anywhere. The best hope of mankind is that God is in him and may flow down through all the secret runnels of the race.\" So important is the personality of Jesus that an entire lesson needs to be devoted to him. In this lesson we shall consider a few of the other Bible characters.\nAbraham\nThat Abraham believed in God and trusted Him to the highest degree is seen in the sacrifice of Isaac. He probably felt as parents do today who sacrifice their sons for the good of their country. There is something of an analogy, too, in the willingness of parents in our Church to send their sons and daughters into strange lands to preach the Gospel. Often they realize that dangers will beset them, but they are proud to give them to the service of our Lord. Our Heavenly Father himself set the divine example, for \"He so loved the world that he gave His only begotten Son.\" Of Abraham, William L. Phelps says, \"Unlike most of the Old Testament heroes, hardly anything evil can be charged against him. He was spiritual-minded. He was obedient to the divine voice, and his unfaltering trust in God was rewarded.\" Mr. Sell says that Abraham stands out as a commanding figure; that he had the traits of character that make great leaders; that he had daring and splendid executive ability; that he was large-hearted and far-sighted and would have made an eminent statesman or victorious general had the opportunity come. Abraham was the founder of the Israelitish nation; his name is revered by Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans; he is still blessing mankind by making it easier for them to worship and love God and by showing them how to live uprightly under trying circumstances.\nMoses\nMoses was another genius, a leader at a critical period of Israelitish history. He was a lawgiver and a statesman; a guide to the Chosen People in Egypt and in the wilderness. Books have been written about Moses. Lectures have characterized him as the great Hebrew statesman. A scientist, calling him \"Moses, the physician,\" has praised his advanced ideas concerning cleanliness and segregation of disease. He is depicted as gentle in manners, modest, and above all self-controlled, courageous, and strong. He has been classed as the \"meekest\" of menthe finest tribute to soldiers and kings. \"The meek shall inherit the earth\" suggests that there is no strength like the strength of meekness. Phelps says, \"That Moses was the meekest man in ancient history, is the best thing said about him.\" The story of Moses' birth and concealment in the rushes is like the plot of a modern novel or movie. When Pharaoh's daughter named him, she did better than she knew, for Moses meant \"drawer out,\" and he drew the Children of Israel out of slavery. His first act of which we have record was indicative of his later career as a deliverer. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, and he killed the Egyptian, though perhaps he knew he would be condemned by his own people, taunted and insulted, and branded as a murderer. Moses' best preparation for his\nlater leadership came to him unconsciously while he kept the flocks of his father-in-law. The quiet, meditative life of the desert shepherd brought him in close communion with God, who gave him the sign of the burning bush to make him aware of his call to leadership. To convince his people that he had been divinely called, Moses was permitted to do a number of impressive miracles, such as turning his rod into a snake, making his hand leprous, and then well and whole again. Later miracles, of course, were much more spectacular, when he was called to compete with the magicians of the king who were trying to subdue the Israelites. The story of the Ten Plagues has been called \"a tragedy in ten acts ending with a climax.\" This story and other incidents in the life of this great man are well known. We need here, perhaps, only to remind ourselves that though he was born in slavery, he stands out as one of the greatest figures in the history of mankind, his chief accomplishment being that he took a people who had been in the worst type of slavery the world has ever known, and made it into a great nation with as pure moral and spiritual ideals as the world has ever known. Great characters in the Bible are not confined to men. Mr. Mead includes many women among his biographies, and Willard Done, of our own Church, wrote a little book entitled Women of the Bible. Among interesting fictional books based on Biblical characters is Mary Borden's Mary of Nazareth. In this lesson we shall consider briefly but one of the great women in the Bible.\n67\nEve\nLittle has been written about Eve, and there is little in the scriptures directly concerning her. Yet she holds a unique position in being the first woman in the world. That Eve had the womanly qualities that have preserved for her daughters their place in the shrine of men's hearts through all succeeding ages is evidenced by Adam's first recorded utterances about her and his willingness to share her fall. He said: \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife: they shall be one flesh.\" (Genesis 2:24) Adam could have refused to partake of the forbidden fruit. He knew well the painful consequences. Condemned for her sin, Eve has been harshly called weak; she has been reproached as the agent through whom mankind fell. She doubtless was weak and failed to discriminate between vastly different values. But let us consider some of her other characteristics. She was highly sensitive to the beauties and glories in the Garden of Eden. She longed for the gifts her tempter promisedwisdom and understanding equal to that of the gods. These would add to her power to enjoy beauty. The serpent, we must remember, had also promised that she would not die. Doubtless, too, she wanted Adam to possess something of inestimable valuethe wisdom of the gods. We must remember that Eve had had no experience. She had not learned, as most of us have to learn, that disobedience brings punishment. The promise that she would know good from evil, that she would see as God, that she would not dieall these constituted so great a temptation that she could not resist it. But to understand the mature woman it is necessary to follow Eve's career outside the Garden of Eden. As Willard Done says: \"The first family was founded and the first real home established when Eve exclaimed in triumph at the birth of Cain, 'I have gotten a man from the Lord!' For the first time in the world the miracle of human birth had been experienced; and Eve was the first to know all the pain and sorrow and joy and triumph it entailed.... The first mother had looked with joy on her first born. The crowning triumph of her life had come, worth the sacrifice even of such a place as Eden. \"As Eve was the first to know the experience of human birth, so she was the first mother to endure the sorrow of death, and that in its most terrible form, the murder of one of her sons by the other. It seems to have been her lot to sound all the depths and reach all the heights of woman's experience, \"as if she had been destined to be an exemplar to her descendants by passing through all the joys, sorrows, glories, and humiliations that woman can know. Into her life were crowded the events which fulfilled the pronouncement following the fall.... To lose her first two sons, one by violent death and the other by the punishment of exile, was to sound the lowest depths of grief and humiliation. It is difficult to conceive of a greater sorrow. In her endurance of this bitterness, Eve proved herself again the heroine we have always thought her to be. And as so often happens in our griefs, the great loss was made up to her. Another son, Seth, was given her to fill, in part, the places left vacant by the murder of Abel and the exile of Cain. \"And so Eve fought her fight and filled her place as the first wife and mother.... To have been the first woman, realizing in her long and eventful life all the experiences of womanhood and earning all its rewards, was to accomplish in its fullness the mission of her sex. No greater appreciation of Eve or higher praise for her work can be given.\" We cannot help wondering if Eve ever had the joy of foreseeing that through a far-off descendant would come one to redeem the world. That vision, could she have foreseen the coming of Christ from her posterity, would have been a comfort and support to her through the years.

Hayes\n\"A thing to be remembered by every man who wishes to make his influence felt for good in our politics is that he must act purely as an American.... If we wish to do good work for our country, we must be unselfish, disinterested, sincerely desirous of the well-being of the commonwealth, and capable of a devoted adherence to a lofty ideal.\" Theodore Roosevelt\nWHEN George Washington was elected President of the United States in 1789, there were no political parties. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the people had divided into Whigs and Tories, or Patriots and Loyalists, but the result of the war had been final, and during the discussion and ratification of the Constitution of the United States, there had been Federalists and Anti-Federalists; the adoption of the Constitution, however, seemed to end the existence of the latter. Nevertheless, there were groups and cleavages from which parties would arise in time. There were the frontier and the settled states along the Atlantic seaboard; the rich and the poor; the agricultural and commercial classes; those who believed in a strong central government and those who stood for the fullest possible sovereignty of the different states; those who believed that the Constitution should be interpreted as strictly as possible and those who wished to give its clauses the widest possible interpretation. But on April 30, 1789, when the inauguration of Washington occurred, there were no party organizations. Washington thus had a clear field from which to make his appointments, and he believed that the presidency should not be a partisan office. When President Washington organized his cabinet, among the prominent men that he called to office were Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, the former becoming Secretary of State and the latter, Secretary of the Treasury. In the different political theories of these two men, one discovers the cleavages from which our two great modern political partiesRepublican and Democratarose. No two men could have been more different, both in character and in views as to what government should be in the newly organized nation. Hamilton was born in the West Indies and as a young boy landed in New York with his fortune to make. He studied law and married into a wealthy New York family and became a leading figure in the state. He had a brilliant mind and an attractive personality. Jefferson was born on the frontier in Virginia. While Hamilton lived among the moneyed classes of New York, Jefferson was influenced by the people of the country life. He had complete faith in the wisdom of what we call \"the common man.\" Hamilton believed in a strong central government, while Jefferson believed that government should be left to the people within their respective states as far as possible. Hamilton stood for a high protective tariff, a tax to protect the manufacturing industries of America. Jefferson believed that the tax or tariff on foreign goods made articles more expensive, and he radically opposed any tax on foreign goods. One can readily see that three great problems soon confronted the American people. They were: (1) Shall negro slavery be eliminated? (2) Shall a high protective tariff be maintained on imported goods? (3) Do the individual states have rights and powers over and above those granted by the Federal Government? Along these lines the American people took sides, and were grouped principally in two political camps, which eventually emerged into our major parties of today. The political parties of our national history grew out of the devergent geographical conditions of the country, for these conditions were conducive of conflicting economic or industrial interests. Cold winters and poor rock soil made most of the area of New England unsuited to extensive agriculture, but the abundant water power, proximity to the raw products of the West, and the skilled labor which that section always had, gave it extensive commercial and industrial advantages. After the War of 1812, aided by a high protective tariff, the industrial development of New England was rapid.. On the other hand, geographical conditions in the South were most favorable to the development of agticulture. The Southern people always complained that the tariff laws of the Government not only restricted trade in the South, but increased the price of manufactured goods. Then, too, the cotton indus-. Try of the Southern States fostered the growth of negro slavery, an institution which the Northern States came to abhor. Each section, therefore, was eager for political power, and during the years from 1780, when our Government was organized, down to the Civil War (1861- 1865), great statesmen lived to fight courageously for the political ideals which they held to be right. Such men were Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas, Jefferson Davis, and many others. It has been said that \"the history of political parties in America  LESSON DEPARTMENT is a history of great statesmen, who though differing with their colleagues stood' shoulder to shoulder in demanding that they be in very truth Americans.\" BRIEF survey will help the reader to understand the history of the two major parties in our political development. From Thomas Jefferson's administration (1801-9) to 1825, the Democratic-Republicans were in power. 'They followed pretty much the policies of Jefferson. In 1825, this party dropped the name Republican, and took the name of Jacksonian Democrats, after Andrew Jackson. A new party was formed to oppose Jackson, which in 1830 took the name of Whigs. From 1830 to 1850, when slavery, states rights, and the tariff became 'bones of contention, the Whig Party gradually grew in power, and out of it came the Republican Party, which elected Abraham Lincoln in 1860. The differences between the interests of the Southern States and those of the Northern States were partly settled by the War of the Rebellion, and since the restoration of the nine 'states which seceded in 1861, there has steadily grown a better understanding of peoples living in different sections of our country. Since the Civil War, the most important phase of the development of our country has been our widespread activities in industry, which have revolutionized manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, and mining. A great machine age has changed our social lives. The power supplied by man's muscle or by that of his domestic animals has been supplemented by steam, electricity, and 7) gasoline. The use of this power aided in the production of great wealth, for manufacturing plants grew in size and were consolidated into larger industries. Trusts were organized; and, because of their tendency to monopolize the industries, the Government found it necessary to attempt legislation. In the larger factories, thousands of laborers were employed, each of whom was engaged in some detailed process of production in which expensive machinery was used. This caused the control of industry to pass from the hands of the worker and led labor to organize. Following the war between the North and the South, high tariffs have enabled great industrial corporations to develop more rapidly. Organized labor sought to increase wages, reduce hours of employment, and secure better sanitary conditions. Here you have the foundation for the differences of opinion between capital and labor. We learn a useful lesson in the study of political parties in our national history. Every man who wishes well of his country is in honor bound to take an active interest in political life. A man who wishes to do good in his community may do so by going into active political life. One can always find men who are desirous of good government, and who if they act together, become at once a power on the side of righteousness. One word more. It concerns our present problems. The present is an introduction to the future. A present problem left unsolved will ripen into a future crisis. With nearly all the world ablaze, it will require the American people to give to their country a united support in conquering those powers that are determined to destroy all that is sacred and secure in our democracy. Questions and Topics for Discussion Note: An ordinary manual or onevolume history of the United States will give brief information on the history of political parties. In your class work, talk over some of the important subjects suggested in this lesson. They are: 1. Why were the American people practically united in their social and political lives at the time of the American Revolution? 2. While there were no political parties at the time of Washington's election to the presidency, discuss the lines of political thought as expressed in the lives of Hamilton and Jefferson. 3. Give all the reasons you can why the Southern States were different from the Northern States in industry, social life, and political thought up to the time of the Civil War. 4. It has been said that the political history of a nation may be studied in the lives of the nation's great political characters. Explain this saying. 5. Find out something about the minor parties that have influenced something of our history; for example, The Prohibition Party, the Know-Nothing Party, the Progressive or Bull Moose Party. 6. On what great issue was Abraham Lincoln elected to the presidency of the United States? 7. Since the Civil War, how has America changed in its industrial, social, and political history?

Democracy finds its fullest expression in the roots of religion, which has ever emphasized the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. For democracy to reach its highest fruition, our society must include that larger liberty preached so eloquently by the Hebrew prophets and by Jesus. (American Citizens Handbook, page 16.) As planned, the program will honor the boys in the service, their parents, wives, and children. It is suggested that seats be reserved at the meeting for the honored families and that Relief Society presidents consult their respective bishops concerning a display of pictures of ward members who are now in the service, if such pictures are not already on display in the chapel. The flag of our nation should also be prominently displayed. Mimeographed copies of the program for use by the audience would add greatly to the success of the program. In order to insure a large attendance, it is recommended that visiting teachers on their regular February visits invite all ward members to be present at this meeting and that advance announcements of this meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members should particularly be urged to attend. The patriotic theme of the program is timely and should appeal to all, both old and young. The program will be more effective if regular ward announcements to be made at the meeting are made preliminary to its presentation.\n\nNOTES TO THE FIELD\nI. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. X.

Benediction.\nSuggestions for Presenting the Program\nThe above program may be presented with or without special scenic and lighting effects and with or without special costumes according to the facilities of the various wards. The opening remarks by a member of the ward Relief Society presidency should briefly welcome those in attendance, point out the theme and objective of the program and explain that it is the outgrowth of one of the Relief Society courses of study of the past year, \"What 'America' Means.\" She should also announce that the families of ward members who are in the service are being honored, giving the number of ward members who are in the service. It is suggested that the person who offers the invocation be advised in advance that the theme of the program is patriotic. The foreword to be given by a young woman (in patriotic costume if desired) is adapted from \"You, at This Moment,\" The American Citizens Handbook, page 4, as follows: You, at this moment, have the honor to belong to a generation whose lips have been touched by fire. The human race now passes through one of its greatest crises. New ideas, new issues, a new call for men to carry on the work of righteousnessall these have come and are daily coming to you. When you are old, however, memory brings back this moment to your minds, let it be able to say to you \"That was a great moment.\" This country in its crisis called for men and women of faith in God, of patience in service, of charity and of insight. I responded to the call however best I could. I gave myself to the Master, to the cause of humane and brave living. For the talk \"The American Way of Life is the Christian Way of Life,\" see The American Citizens Handbook, page 6, et passim; also an address by Elder Stephen L Richards, Deseret News, Church Edition, June 6, 1942. The following excerpts from the address by Elder Richards are particularly appropriate for use in this talk: This is a Christian nation. America had its inception in Christian principles and doctrines; it was founded, nurtured and built by Christian men and women, Christian concepts have been incorporated into its basic laws and institutions and its loftiest ideals and purposes are but the expression of Christian virtue. We hear a lot of talk nowadays about the American way of life. What is this American way of life? Is it anything other than the Christian way of life? If it differs essentially, if it contemplates something other than Christian liberty under law, then I'm not so enthusiastic to have my sons fight for it. I believe, however, that you will find on analysis that this American way of life we prize so highly is in reality a Christian concept.... Restraints are supposed to be imposed by self-discipline rather than exterior force. People are free to make their own choices, endowed with a freedom that can be curtailed or limited only as may be necessary to assure the same freedom to all.... I make the assertion that we cannot hope to obtain that great spiritual support which we now so sorely need except upon the basis of truly Christian living. I think this to be so necessary because, as I interpret the issues at stake, we are really fighting a religious war. I think that our armies on the battlefields of the world and our civilian army here at home are really fighting to preserve the cause of Christ in the earth. I know they may not be conscious of such an objective. I wish they were. Since this talk is to be followed by the singing of \"Recessional,\" it would be well for the speaker to refer to what usually happens when men forget their dependence upon God. She might even quote from the \"Recessional,\" saying that it is to be sung following her talk. Following the rendition of the \"Recessional,\" the talk \"Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Preserve the Cause of Freedom,\" is presented. In this talk it is suggested that the speaker explain how our Church has always stood by our\n\nNOTES TO THE FIELD\ncountry in her hour of need. Reference could be made to the Mormon Battalion and the history connected with it. At this point, someone in the background representing President Brigham Young might speak, first apparently addressing Captain Allen in these words: You shall have your battalion, Captain Allen, and if there are not young men enough we will take the old men, and if they are not enough we will take the women. Brigham Young might next appear to address members of the Mormon Battalion as follows: I want to say to every man, the constitution of the United States as framed by our Fathers was dictated, was revealed, was put into their hearts by the Almighty, and I tell you it is as good as ever I could ask for. I say unto you, magnify the laws. There is no law in the United States or in the Constitution but I am ready to make honorable. Following the statements by Brigham Young, the speaker might continue, pointing out that at the time of World War I, President Joseph F. Smith said: I believe it is righteous and just for every people to defend their own lives and their own liberties, and their own homes, with the last drop of their blood. I believe that the Lord will sustain any people trying to preserve their wives and their children from the ravages of war. At the conclusion of the talk \"Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom,\" the \"Credo\" by Elias Lieberman, The American Citizens Handbook, pp. 70-71, would be very effective read by a soldier, if one is availablethis to be followed by a patriotic number from the Relief Society Singing Mothers. The talk \"Our Boys As Missionary-Soldiers,\" to be given by a young woman, could explain what some of the ideals are that can be fostered in service men by the girls at home. The following brief excerpt from a letter recently written to a mother by her son who is serving his country overseas might be read: I wish it were possible to tell you in person how much I depend upon my Heavenly Father for guidance and inspiration; how each day the Gospel means more and more to me. During these distressing times and periods of temptation the principles which you and father have taught me through deeds and words are always before me, and they serve as a real stabilizer. I feel I am able to be tolerant without compromising; to segregate the good from the evil, for I understand the source. Humbly I feel that through the help of the Lord and you dear ones at home I am able to be an influence for good. For the short tribute \"Our Flag,\" which should precede the singing by the congregation of the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" see the short article, \"Respect the Flag,\" The American Citizens Handbook, p. 151. During this tribute, the flag, which has been in evidence during the evening, might be spotlighted and an electric fan used to make it wave as the congregation sings our national anthem. At the conclusion of the singing, while the audience remains standing, the same young woman who gave the foreword should give the conclusion, as follows: America first, not merely in matters material, but in things of the spirit. Not merely in science, inventions, motors, and skyscrapers, but also in ideals, principles, and character. Not merely in the calm assertion of rights, but in the glad assumption of duties. No flaunting her strength as a giant, but bending in helpfulness over a sick and wounded world like a Good Samaritan.... Not in treading again the old, worn, bloody, pathway which ends inevitably in chaos and disaster, but in blazing a new trail along which, please God, other nations will follow, into the new Jerusalem where wars shall be no more. Some day, some nation must take that pathunless we are to lapse into utter barbarismand that honor I covet for my beloved America. The American Citizens Handbook, p. 61. The speaker then looks heavenward as she voices this prayer by the poet Longfellow: Lord, let war's tempest cease, Fold the whole world in peace Under Thy wings. Make all the nations one, All hearts beneath the sun. Till Thou shalt reign alone, Great King of Kings.\nPublication of Leads for Class Leaders Balance\nTHE, pp. 640, 655, announced that a new book, \"Leads for Class Leaders,\" to be issued by the Relief Society General Board, would be ready for use sometime during the fall, 1942. The General Board sincerely regrets that due to unavoidable circumstances work on the book was delayed, making publication impossible during the fall of 1942 as announced. It is the present plan of the General Board to issue the book in time for use during the next educational year, which begins in October 1943.\nIt is suggested that no closing song be sung and that the benediction follow Longfellow's prayer. The estimated time required for the presentation of the complete program as outlined is one and one-half hours. It is suggested that wards desiring to give less time to the presentation of the program either omit the talk, \"Our Boys As Missionary-Soldiers,\" or combine its message with the talk, \"Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom.\" The tribute to the flag might also be eliminated in the interest of time. Suggestions for appropriate musical numbers will be found in The, pp. 868-870.\nElder Stephen L Richards Lectures Over KSL\nBEGINNING Sunday evening, December 27, 1942, and continuing each Sunday for several weeks, Elder Stephen L Richards, of the Council of the Twelve, is delivering on the regular Sunday evening broadcasting time of the Church, over radio station KSL, at 9:15 M. W. T., a series of lectures entitled \"The Church in War and Peace.\" The broadcast originates in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Special vocal music is under the direction of J. Spencer Cornwall, director of the Tabernacle choir, with Alexander Schreiner, Tabernacle organist, at the console of the great organ. This broadcast should interest and value to all Church members inasmuch as the lectures give Gospel interpretations of present-day situations.\nNOTES TO THE FIELD 43\nMessage of First Presidency Published In Booklet Form\nTHE message from the First Presidency delivered in the Tabernacle, Saturday, October 3, 1942, during the opening session of the 113th Semi-Annual General Conference of the Church, has been published in convenient booklet form, size 3x4\", and distributed to Latter-day Saint families throughout the Church, to missionaries, and to Latter-day Saint men in the service. The General Board expresses its appreciation to the First Presidency for making this important message available in such convenient and attractive form. Relief Society members are urged to read the message carefully and thoughtfully, and it is suggested that mothers discuss it with their families. The counsel and guidance given on drink and the Word of Wisdom, chastity, parenthood, unity, and the war are of vital importance to us today. The message to the men in the armed service, and the blessing, commendation, and comfort given to officers and members of the Church are of inestimable worth.\nRelief Society Presidents to Encourage Use of New Book, \"Recreation in the Home\"\nRELIEF SOCIETY presidents are requested to cooperate in the distribution and use of the new book \"Recreation in the Home\" recently published by the General Boards of the auxiliary organizations of the Church. Coming at a time when the use of automobiles is restricted and when other conditions incident to the war make it necessary for us to be resourceful and economical in our recreational activities, the book meets a present-day need. It contains many new games and many old favorites, and is fertile in suggestions for many other types of recreation. Games and other activities included in the book can be played and enjoyed by large and small groups of all ages, with a minimum amount of equipment, work, and expense required. To aid in the distribution and use of the book, ward Relief Society presidents are asked to announce its publication at one of the regular Relief Society meetings, preferably a work-and-business meeting, calling attention to its content and its value for use in the home and for larger groups. It is also recommended that the book be used in planning Relief Society parties or other social activities, thus demonstrating its value. Relief Society officers and members should not only know that there is such a book, but should own and use it. \"Recreation in the Home\" may be purchased from the Relief Society General Board, 28 Bishop's Building, or from the general offices of the other Church auxiliary organizations. Price 25 cents, postpaid.\nThe Mormon Handicraft Shop\nTHE Mormon Handicraft Shop is your shop, established to help Relief Society women. Are you supporting it? There are three ways in which you can help the Shop: First, the Shop must have articles to sell, such as pillowcases with lovely white crocheted edges, quilts, attractive aprons, exquisite clothing for babies, useful hot pads, fine handkerchiefs, etc. When articles are beautifully made, of suitable, good material, and of desired colors, they will sell readily. The Shop can now use many such articles. You can encourage women to make these lovely articles to be sold. Have you found that lonely sister or the one who is homebound and have you encouraged her to make some lovely and useful article? This interest would mean a great deal in her life. How about the sister who needs to help herself financially, who would appreciate having a little extra money of her own to spend? This is made possible by sending her articles to be sold. The second way in which you may help the Shop is to buy there whenever possible. When you need a distinctive handmade gift, reasonably priced, it can be found at the Shop. Remember, this is a day of advertising. Never miss an opportunity to tell your neighbors and friends about Mormon Handicraft. Third, you may help the Shop by paying the annual membership fee of $1. Many of our wards are paying this yearly fee, and in so doing are helping to support this worthy project. May we add your ward to our list of Mormon Handicraft supporters? We feel, especially, that wards in close proximity to the Shop should support it in every possible way.\nAuxiliary Leaders Protest Picturization of Smoking and Drinking\nUNDER date of November 14, 1942, the following letter signed by the general presidencies and superintendencies of the Church auxiliary organizations, was sent to Mr. Will H. Hays, of the nation's film industry, protesting the picturization of smoking, drinking, and vulgarity in films. These auxiliary leaders represent a total active membership of 747,688 men, women, and children. The increasing use in motion pictures of tobacco and alcoholic beverages is alarming, and it is in recognition of the effect of this upon youth that the auxiliary leaders ask that an effort be made to eliminate these items from the films as far as possible:\nMr. Will H. Hays 28 West 44th Street New York, New York\nDear Mr. Hays:\nFor some time the auxiliary organizations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been alarmed at the increasing use in motion pictures of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. By the constant presentation of drinking and smoking on the screen the wholesome resistance of youth and childhood is being broken down.\nNovember 14, 1942\n\nNOTES TO THE FIELD 45\nDrama is one of the cultural fields with which we have full sympathy and in which some of our organizations work extensively among the young people. We know of the immense influence of dramatic representation on the human mind. It is conceded that in some situations the use of tobacco and liquor might legitimately give a truer picture of life, although our own standards lead us to ban these articles from the stage. Incidentally, we have been pleased to see that plays do not suffer thereby. A talented group of professional and amateur players recently put on \"The Man Who Came to Dinner,\" without smoking, drinking, profanity or vulgarity, and without lessening, strange as it may seem, the humor in the slightest. We know, therefore, that a great decrease in the use of tobacco and alcohol on the stage can be accomplished if there is the will to do it, and we earnestly petition you to set standards that will reduce these harmful things to the minimum. Although most states, perhaps all, have statutes forbidding the use of tobacco or alcoholic drinks by minors, yet whenever a drink is taken in a play, or cigarette lighted, especially by actors who represent to the young patrons almost everything desirable in life, a definite impact is made on their resistance to observe the law. The liquor and tobacco interests know the power of such example and of course do everything to extend the use of these articles in the business of the play. It is most unfortunate that the great institution of motion pictures, with its immeasurable educational and character forming influence, should be used to promote this evil. That is truly a breach of its great trust. Our responsibility to childhood and youth besides giving them the spiritual training to prepare them for eternal life, includes the endeavor to help them be healthy, temperate, upright and clean. Alcohol and tobacco, with their degenerative effects endanger both objectives. We commend you for all the fine things that you have donethe elimination of profanity, for example. And now in the name of our youth and of all American youth we appeal to you, who bear so much moral responsibility in this phase of our recreational life, to look into this situation and answer to your conscience as the good American that you are. We believe the wrong done to impressionable young people will tend to debauch individuals and bring about a poorer grade of American manhood and womanhood. Those who love America will support you in the action we plead with you to take.\nGENERAL PRESIDENCY OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S RELIEF SOCIETY, By Amy Brown Lyman, President, Representing 115,015 mothers\nGENERAL SUPERINTENDENCY OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION, By George D.

            "content": "THIS NIGHT Linnie Fisher Robinson - We toiled, beloved, to build a universe secure, Hoping for lasting peace, where we could turn To things of home; nor dreamed our sons should thus endure Days like those other ones we knew. But hate fires burn, Raging across the world; dreams fall apart Leaving but blackened ruins smoldering behind, Bringing despair to try the human heart And tear security from out the human mind. Yet counting all the sands our lives have known, Adding our joy when peace lay on the land, We can but say that life is good; we can but own That, through those storms, we knew that God was in command. Today, that candle, in this dark, shines bright For things our sons shall gather past the night!  Psychological WarfareAn Invisible Weapon Mark K. Allen Psychologist, Utah State Training School WAR is fought today from three principal approaches: the economic, the military, and the psychological. Economic warfare means \"starvation for our enemies and food for our friends.\" It means keeping the enemy from obtaining from anywhere in the world the things he needs to live and to make war on usthe food, the iron, the fuel, and the other materials needed to make and operate a war machine. In an age of mechanization, this type of warfare is very important. In this type of warfare the economicthe Allies had the better of the argument in World War 1. But in this war, the Axis has already reduced through conquest this economic inequality. In the military phase of war, until recently, the Axis seems to have had a definite advantage, because of longer preparation, more thorough training, and a more definite military plan than was the case with the United Nations. Our present mobilization and arms production program, as well as mass air attacks on Axis war industries, are calculated to remove this advantage. The third type of warfarethe psychologicalmeans weakening the opponent through all sorts of tricks designed to confuse, to frighten, to discourage, to mislead, and to divide. It is \"an offensive war waged with intellectual and emotional weapons to destroy the power of morale resistance in the enemy's army and civilian population and to diminish enemy prestige in the eyes of the neutrals.\" An Axis spokesman has said, speaking of psychological warfare, that \"It is essential to attack the enemy nation in its weak spots, to undermine and break down its resistance, and to convince it that it is being deceived, misled, and. Brought to destruction by its own government. 'Thus the people will lose confidence in the justice of its cause so that the political opposition in those nations will raise its head and become a more powerful trouble-maker. The enemy nation's originally solid, powerful, and well-knit fabric must be gradually disintegrated, broken down, rotted, so that it falls apart like a fungus treaded upon in a forest.\" Psychological warfare consists of spreading rumors, false reports, threats, and fears of deadly secret weapons. The channels through which this type of warfare is prosecuted are short-wave radio, fifth column, and rumors planted by agents of the opponents and spread by people uncritically. The type of material spread usually has to do with the strength of the aggressor, the weakness of the defender, and the futility of resistance. An attempt is made to discredit the leaders of the opposing nations. In early stages of psychological warfare, a feeling of Page 23 easy complacency is encouraged by promises of non-aggression. Psychological warfare is referred to today by news commentators as the \"war of nerves,\" the \"strategy of terror,\" \"breaking down the home front,\" \"demoralizing the enemy,\" and the \"war of words,\" or propaganda. With the stepping up of communications, especially the radio, psychological warfare has taken on a new significance in the present war. There is nothing incomprehensible in this type of warfare, and every American should thoroughly understand it and realize how treacherously it can attack, even over many thousands of miles of land and sea. Let us, then, turn to the problem of psychological warfare as practiced against the Democracies, Freedom of ptess, of speech, and of assembly all censored or denied in totalitarian countries as a step in the psychological preparation of their own peoplein democratic countries provide fertile soil in which to wage psychological warfare. The Axis program has three principal aims: (1) to increase conflict and disunity among us; (2) to produce anxiety, fear, and confusion; and (3) to produce apathy and disillusionment. Just as the Axis strategy on the battlefield is to divide and then to conquer, so on the psychological front every possible device is employed to promote disunity among us. The starting points are our own latent prejudices. A few of the most common possibilities are racial, religious, political, national, and economic class prejudices. The efforts of the enemies of this country to stir up racial hatreds are well known, and the nearer their claims fit our prejudices, the more they stir up strife and disunity among us. Religious prejudices are easily aroused by propaganda, and political disunity is readily promoted. Repeated attempts have been made to drive wedges between the United States and Great Britain by saying that \"Britain always gets someone else to pull her chestnuts out of the fire.\" Likewise, Japan points out to China the futility of expecting continued help from allies who have so miserably \"let her down in the past.\" Short-wave radio propaganda from nations at war with us has been particularly directed toward stirring up economic class hatred in America. One of the corner stones of this plan of conquest is the hope that America will collapse from within because of the failure to achieve class unity. Labor is stirred up against capital, and capital against labor. Unfortunately, many people in this country are caught in this trap because of already established prejudices along this line of thinking, which, of course, invites propaganda of this character from the enemies of this country. The second general aim of psychological warfare, after divisions are fostered among the people, is to produce anxiety, fear, and confusion. This is done through pointing out to the victim the invincibility of the aggressor. It consists of a strong military power intimidating a weaker one into submission. The weak are told of the fate of other victims, and are warned of a worse fate, and impressed with the futility of resistance. This \"strategy of terror' has been one of the cruelest weapons of the aggressors. If weak peoples still resisted after due warning, their fate  PSYCOLOGICAL WARFARE was as bad as promised and became a warning to the next victim. Terror is spread by several devices. Civilian bombing is perhaps the most dreadful. Bombs are even made to scream to add to the terror. Incendiaries and delayed-action bombs prolong and intensify the terror of mass raids. The threat of gas bombs has also been used to advantage. Fear has been spread by such tricks as throwing images on the clouds with huge lantern-slide projectors. _ Little does a warring nation care whether its opponents are destroyed by bombs and shells or by psychological methods so long as they cease resistance. Panic and a broken will to resist through actual combat or war work is the aim of the \"strategy of terror.\" If psychological victories can be won, they are usually much less costly than actual military conquests. It is difficult to estimate how much aggressor armies and machines have been spared by psychological victories of the propaganda bureaus. Confusion is spread by circulating all sorts of false news reports. Reports from an opposing nation may say an attack will be made at a certain time at a certain place. Then the place will be changed. When sufficient confusion has been caused, an attack will be made at a wholly unexpected place. Confusion makes organized resistance more difficult. False reports have been circulated repeatedly in this war by nations whose armies were locked in close combat with those of other nations, often successfully dispersing and disorganizing the opposing forces. The third aim of psychological warfare is to promote apathy and disillusionment. The Axis nations have 25 been known to spread much propaganda about some great action, such as the move through the Balkans, then the talk would subside, then it would start up again and die down again. Finally, when everyone had become apathetic about it, they would strike. Japan talked of arbitrating her difficulties with United States up until the very day the attack was made on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese have repeatedly tried to disillusion the people of the United States about the reliability of the reports given them from the Navy as to losses. Japan's technique is to announcesometimes accurately, but often notUnited States' naval losses several days in advance of the Navy's reports. In the battle of Java, 'in which United States losses were severe, Japan announced them with some accuracy many days before our reportthe aim being to make it appear to the people of this country that Japan forced the Navy to make admissions it otherwise would not have made. People should constantly be on guard against this trick, remembering how important it. Is for our Navy to avoid giving information to opposing nations. Another plan is to announce several days in advance the capture of a certain city which is quite sure to be taken later. This forces a denial from the defenders at first, but an admission later when the city is actually takenall of which, it is hoped, will establish confidence in the reliability of reports from the opposing nations and a distrust of reports of one's own nation. Another trick of similar character, practiced by the Axis, is the announcement of false victories for the Democracies. Since we are watchful for good news, we may accept these reports, not suspecting their origin. Later, when reports prove untrue, we become disillusioned and confused. The secretive way in which the Axis powers plan campaigns often lulls us into a sense of false security. Our perilous plight of unpreparedness during the early months of this war was our punishment for years of this weakness. Nations at war with the United States have taken great advantage of our easy optimism and uncritical self-sufficiency. We have failed to take a proper measure of those who are against us, and we have considerably overestimated the security we have in extensive but undeveloped material resources and manpower. Nations opposing this country still feign weakness at times to lull us into this sense of false security and the resulting relaxation of effort. Another potent psychological weapon is the peace offensive. Should the United Nations appear to be really about to win the war, a strong bid for peace can surely be expected from the Axis. The hope will be to lull the Democracies back into a sense of false security, while further preparation may be made to attack them. The Axis nations real- 2 ize how \"pacifistic\" at heart we are, and they are sure to attempt to turn this fine ideal to our destruction. The defense against psychological warfare is as complicated as war itself. Let us hope that some understanding of what it is will aid in our resistance to it. However, civilians can prepare themselves against it in some measure by abiding by the following suggestions: First, keep reliably informed on the daily news. Learn to check habitually the sources of all reports and to evaluate their content according to their source. Second, don't carry rumors. They are the most unreliable source of news there is. Remember, most of them are planted by those opposed to us, and they are meant to confuse and mislead us. Always ask the tumor monger where he got his story. Write it down if it sounds vicious enough, then check it with your civilian defense authorities. You might thus help to find fifth columnists. Don't repeat rumors to your neighbots. Third, speak constructively of democracy and its leaders. This doesn't mean not to criticize, but it does mean to learn to see and to speak of all that is good as well as that which needs correcting. FAITH AND COURAGE The following Christmas message by Nicholas Murray Butler may appropriately be carried into the new year: Christmas Day in this year of grace will be celebrated with civilization at the lowest mark in the history of modern times. This means that more than ever men of light and leading and insight must have faith and courage and hope. They must not and cannot let their faith weaken in those everlasting ideals which must rule any civilized and peaceful world...."

            "content": "Little Stones that Change the Course of Rivers Lella Marler Hoggan O river runs down to the sea N without meeting with obstacles and interferences. And no life fulfills its destiny without overcoming trials and hardships. Yet we chafe under restraint. We resent interference. We become frustrated when sorrow and disappointment disrupt our plans. We feel that life should run smoothly for us. Why should our course be hampered and blocked at every turn? Why should obstacles be forever retarding our progress? Are the very fates discriminating against us? Know this, O friend, neither life nor law discriminate against anyone. We reach the high goals we set out to achieve through the conquest of difficulties. Said J. G. Holland: f We rise by the things that are 'neath our feet; By what we have mastered of good and gain. By the pride deposed and the passion slain, And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet. There is a native in his island home who believes that \"the strength and valor of the enemy he kills passes into himself.\" Symbolically, this is true. We gain strength and development from the conquest of difficult undertakings. Disappointments and delays are often the forces that are preparing. Us to assume responsibilities of importance. We have to meet and overcome trials before we are in readiness to accept the great trusts. Said a great poet: A chance rock in an upland brook, May change a river's course. And yet no rock, No, nor the baffling mountains of the world, Can hold it from its destiny, the sea. Though a stone may divert the stream from its original channel, the water flows around it and makes its way in and out, under and over, past stick arid pebble and deadwood and growing things, on and on until it reaches the surging sea. The picturesque cataract that breaks in sparkling grandeur over a jagged cliff and spills itself in lacy rainbows down a mountain gorge, has gathered the very force that glorifies it from the obstruction that blocked its way. To accept the barriers on life's pathway as impediments to progress is to admit defeat before we have undertaken the journey. All lives are beset by struggle and pain and sorrow. This is nature's way of teaching us the things we need to know. We can't gain experience through the efforts of someone else. Our joys and sorrows must come first hand. We have to work in order to learn to work. We have to suffer in order to gain insight into life. We have to pray in order to learn what prayer means. Real values come only through earnest effort. Intellectual growth and spiritual development are not attained. By listless wishing. Emerson said: \"The law of nature is, Do the thing, and you shall have the Page 27 power: but they who do not the thing have not the power.\" It is not the reward, but the struggle that perfects us. Effort precedes efficiency, and \"joy is in the quest.\" Weare forever consoling ourselves with alibis and excuses for the things we have failed to accomplish. Though we can not explain our weaknesses and failures away, even to ourselves, still we can overcome them and lift ourselves nearer to the ideal that we secretly cherish. Our strength of character is measured by our mastery of the trials we have met. What we think and feel and do puts its mark upon us with indelible fingers. Truly \"the gods we worship write their names on our faces.\" SCOUTMASTER and some members of his troop were attending a rodeo. They stood on the sidelines one morning and watched a procession march gaily down the street. Decked in full regalia, a group of Indians from a nearby reservation headed the parade. Brilliant Navajo blankets covered their horses' backs in lieu of saddles. But nothing 'excited the admiration of the on-lookers so much as the gorgeous war bonnets worn by the old Indian chieftains. These bonnets not only encircled their faces with bright feathers and other trophies, but also extended gracefully down their backs nearly to their feet. At the close of the parade a pompous young man stepped up to one of the Indians and offered him a handful of small coins for his war bonnet. The Indian silently shook his head. \"Doesn't he understand the fellow?\" asked one of the scouts. \"Yes,\" said the scoutmaster, that Indian speaks English as fluently as you or I do. But his war bonnet, like your merit badges, is not for sale. Every eagle feather, every weasel tail, every bear's claw in his bonnet is a symbol of some heroic accomplishment or brave deed. The headdress represents years of effort and is a mark of honor and heroism. He would no more sell it than a king would sell his crown.\" The scouts understood, for each of them was wearing trophies that had cost him long hours of study and effort to obtain. They knew the delight that comes from a worthy achievement. Too often we adults miss the joy of some great accomplishment because we lack the courage or confi-. Dence to begin. We tell ourselves that we are too old or too busy or that we haven't the ability for such an undertaking. We let our fears and misgivings baffle us. We wall ourselves out from privileges we might enjoy. We permit lost opportunities to taunt us, old age to frighten us, ignorance to threaten us. Our mistakes rise up before us like shrouded ghosts in the darkness to accuse and intimidate us. Down with the wall! Banish the spectre! Forget the failures of yesterday! Are we not God's children all? And have we not been assured that He will give us strength and courage according to our need? To the valiant hearted there is no ultimate defeat. There is always a tomorrow. \"True art,\" says Annie Pike Greenwood, \"is in bringing some sort of triumph out of pain.\"\"* Even the Master knew Gethsemane and the cross. But did He not tise to triumphant glory, to stand as the Savior of the world and as a guiding light to mankind forevermore? *Used by special permission of author."

Transgressions\" and seek to make \"a new heart and a new spirit,\" for there is encouragement in viewing the events of the past year as being behind one and regarding the new year that lies ahead much as a book, unmarred and unmarked, containing three hundred and sixty-five blank pages on which will be written defeats or triumphs, retrogression or progress. It is true that many of the events which may affect one during the coming year arise through no volition of the individual; but the pages of this yearbook will glow with beauty or be drab and even uglynot because of events that may transpire, but according to the manner in which the individual meets these events. The most luminous page may shine with faith developed from experiencing one of life's darkest tragedies. This life is a time of testing and proving whether or not one is a true Latter-day Saint. \"I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.\" To write a yearbook worthy of a Latter-day Saint, one must continually study the Gospel and seek to live a life in accordance with its teachings. The more one studies, the more clearly do one's own faults and even transgressions cry out for correction. In this inward searching, the first examination may well reveal failings manifested in the home in one's daily life. Is there need of more patience and understanding for loved ones, or is there the need for more firmness and discipline? Is a resolution wanted to make every minute count? Brigham Young once said \"that our time was all we could call our own, we should have to give an account of it, and therefore we should use it to the best possible advantage in assisting to build up the Kingdom of God on earth.\" On the other hand, should more time be devoted to the home the better to guard it, should more care be given to train one's children more perfectly in the laws and principles of the Gospel, in having family prayers and in studying the scriptures? One may also resolve to more frequently visit the sick, seek to bring cheer to the afflicted and comfort to the sorrowing, and to more faithfully attend to one's Church duties. But perhaps it is wisdom not to undertake too many resolutions at once, although one does naturally continually strive to improve in many ways. One or two resolutions faithfully kept are better than many abandoned before the keeping has become a habit. It is well, finally, when making a resolution to live and plan for the day alone and let the tomorrows wait until they in turn become today. The present moment is the only time that must be lived. If then as each succeeding year advances, resolutions are made and kept looking toward improvement and development, these resolutions will, in time, serve as stepping stones to a better life; and the yearbooks will glow ever brighter illuminating a character striving to obey that great dictum, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\"M. C. S."

Through the courtesy of the General Board of Relief Society, a centennial gift was presented to each ward in the form of a phonograph record containing centennial messages from President Heber J. Grant and President Amy Brown Lyman. \"The North Ward Relief Society planted a tree in accordance with the recommendation of the General Board. A short program was given in connection with the tree-planting on Tuesday afternoon, March 17. Talks were given by A. E. Smith, bishop, and Robert P. Garrett, counselor. The record sent by the General Board was played. The tree, a cutleaf weeping white birch, was planted on the North Ward Relief Society grounds. \"On Tuesday evening, a pageant, \"The Gate Beautiful\" was presented by the North Ward Relief Society to members of the three Nephi wards. The pageant was under the supervision of President Mary E. Boswell and was directed by Ellen\nPage 48\nGarrett, Fern B. Garrett, and Minnie J. Smith. Music was furnished by the Monson sisters of American Fork, a quartet consisting of Afton Lambert, Emma C. Cannon, Eugene Beck, and Nello Sudweeks, which sang appropriate selections, and solos were given by Verda Beck and Emma C. Cannon. Mrs. Douglas Jones was the reader, and members of the cast were Relief Society women of the North Ward. The pageant was a most creditable performance. \"The Nephi Ward observed the centennial with an appropriate program which consisted of an account of the first Relief Society organization given by Birdie C. Jones; humorous selections by Florence R. Winn; a duet by Susannah and May Wilkey; cello solo, Vivian Hoyt; tribute to former presidents of the Nephi Ward Relief Society, given by Priscilla Wilson. Each president was presented with a flower. A reading, 'I Am Proud' was given by Mrs. Douglas Jones. Mrs. Laura B. Brough made an interesting report of changes in transportation, dress, home conveniences and status of women during the one hundred years since the founding of Relief Society. A chorus of Singing Mothers rendered two selections.... \"In the South Ward an address of welcome was given by counselor NOTES FROM THE FIELD 49 CENTENNIAL PAGEANT, \"THE GATE BEAUTIFUL\" Woodruff Ward Relief Society, Snowflake Stake Jennie Hobbs.

EVANS, second counselor in the Relief Society presidency of the North Idaho Falls Stake, submitted the following report of centennial activities in this stake: \"We wish to report to you some of the centennial activities of our stake. We presented the cantata 'Resurrection Morning,' by B. Cecil Gates, as a stake unit of one hundred Singing Mothers. The chorus furnished the music for our stake conference. The cantata, conducted by Mrs. O. D. Hendrickson with Mrs.. J. O. Mellor as accompanist, was presented Sunday afternoon, March 15, 1942, in the stake tabernacle. It was very well rendered to a large audience. We had members participating from eleven of the twelve wards and branchesone branch being sixty-three miles away. We held a prayer meeting with all chorus members before the concert, and then presented cach member with a golden boutonniere, and the chorister and organist with a blue and gold corsage. \"At this meeting we displayed the scrapbooks made by eleven of our twelve wards and branches. In their arrangement the books showed much originality, artistic ability, and historical worth. A volume of Gospel Standards by President Heber J. Grant was presented, to the centennial chairman of the Ucon Ward as a prize for the best scrapbook. \"On Monday, March 16, we left daffodils with twelve Latter-day Saint mothers, reminding them of the centennial observance the next day and of the time of the radio 51 broadcasts from Salt Lake City. From the interest shown by these mothers, we certainly felt well repaid for the calls we made. \"On March 17, the Idaho Falls Fourth Ward held a special centennial program with President Luna Norton and counselors in charge of arrangements. Under the direction of Mrs. Jacob H. Trayner, with Mr. Trayner as reader, a pageant in twelve scenes, entitled 'Mothers and Daughters of the Ages,' was presented with special costumes and lighting effects to a full house. Mrs. J. O. Mellor, pianist, and Dorothy Burnham, violinist, rendered appropriate music during the pageant. Twenty-six persons represented the various characters portrayed. One scene showed a reproduction in giant size of the cover of the January 1942 issue of Reproduction of cover of January used in pageant by Idaho Falls Fourth Ward Relief Society  CENTENNIAL TREE-PLANTING CEREMONY ON NEW IDAHO FALLS TEMPLE GROUNDS, NOVEMBER 4, 1942 Members and officials of the North Idaho Falls, Idaho Falls, and Yellowstone Stakes participated. Thewhich was a picture of the proposed centennial memorial campanile to be erected on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. \"The Osgood Ward made nearly 200 handprinted programs for their celebration. The entire evening performance in this ward was very fine and well presented. \"All Relief Society organizations in our stake participated in a centennial tree-planting service in their respective wards, using the centen-. Nial markers.\" On November 4, 1942, members and officials of the North Idaho Falls, Idaho Falls, and Yellowstone Stakes participated in a tree-planting ceremony at the new Idaho Falls Temple grounds. A beautiful blue spruce was planted on the northeast corner of the grounds, and a special marker was placed nearby. An excerpt from an account of this activity in the Idaho Falls Post-Register of November 12 states: The following program was presented: community singing conducted by Mrs. J. O. Mellor; invocation by Mrs. Grant M. Andrus; address of welcome by president Ethel Miles [North Idaho Falls Stake Relief Society president]; selection by a trumpet trio composed of Don Julian, Ray Bennett and Fred Haroldsen; a talk, \"Special Thoughts on Trees,\" by Mrs. Joseph Brunt; dedicatory prayer by Joseph A. Brunt. Mr. Brunt, representing the North Idaho Falls Stake, J. W. Telford, representing the Idaho Falls Stake, and Horace A. Hess of the Yellowstone Stake,. Assisted in placing the soil on the tree. Mrs. Miles, President Cora Christensen of the Idaho Falls Stake Relief Society, past stake presidents, and honorary officers also participated NOTES FROM THE FIELD in the ceremonies. The program was under the direction -of Mrs. G. S. Evans, assisted by Robert F. Woller, temple gardener. Sister Evans stated in a subsequent letter of November 23 that, \"We are very thankful to Brother Woller, the temple gardner, and Brother Irvin T. Nelson, Church landscape architect, for assisting us and granting us this privilege. We had had stormy weather for several days, but the morning [of November 4] was clear, although cold. The program was short but well attended by approximately 100 people, and everyone seemed thrilled with the occasion. After the ceremony, the members who wished to go were escorted through the temple. We surely felt that the efforts were worth while.\" Seattle Stake (Seattle, Washington) HE Bremerton Ward Relief Society reported its centennial birthday party, held March 17, 1942, as follows: \"The ward chapel and recreation hall were decorated in the Relief Society colorsblue and gold. The opening feature of the celebration was a tree-planting ceremony, at which time we planted a tree on the chapel grounds. Appropriate remarks were made by Bishop John J. Fry, and the song \"Trees was sung by Ruth Fry. \"After this ceremony, everyone went into the chapel, where an impressive birthday cake held a place of attention, and a candle-lighting ceremony was given in honor of new members.. Our president, Chloe Later, presided, with Linda Eddington, second counselor, and Bertha 53 McCleary, coordinator, assisting her. Each new member of the past year was presented with a lovely corsage. \"Another feature of the evening's entertainment was a cantata entitled 'Messengers of Mercy,' by Gladys Rich and Minnie D. Warner, presented by the Singing Mothers under the direction of Sarah Hickman, with Mercia Haneberg as accompanist. A very lovely pageant, 'The Guardianship of Life,' was presented under the direction of Rose Willey and President Chloe Later. It had a cast of about twenty people. Violet Nerden, soloist, was accompanied by Alta Larson. Thelma Higbee was the reader. \"One feature of the program, the words of greeting by recording from President Heber J. Grant and President Amy Brown Lyman, was greatly appreciated. Ethelyn Lay and Chloe Stayner had charge of refreshments. 'The one hundred people present declared that the party was one of the loveliest ones of the year.\" Los Angeles Stake (Los Angeles, California) THE Beverly Hills Ward Relief Society, of which Estella C. Dalton was president, presented a unique centennial program using letters, tableaux, and a cantata to depict \"Relief Society Beginnings\" and \"A Century of Achievement.\" Helen Cottam, secretary, reported the observance as follows: \"Letters narrating 'Relief Society Beginnings' were written for the occasion by one of our members, Isabel Vine Broadbeck. They were tead by a reader dressed in a typical 1842 costume, who was shown writing them in her Nauvoo home. Be- tween the reading of each letter, our Relief Society chorus, assisted by Lola Brimley, director, Mary Rex, accompanist, and Jessie Turner, soloist, sang selections from the cantata 'Messengers of Mercy,' by Gladys Rich and Minnie D. Warner. In conjunction with the readings and the rendition of the cantata, tableaux in costume and with stage properties were, presented to show scenes related to the letters.\" An original poem, \"A Century of Achievement,\" written by Alva Wilson, was given by two women, Emma Gardner representing Emma Smith, and Ruby Armstrong representing a modern Relief Society president. This was given just before the final tableau depicting \"Women of Service in 1942.\" Estella C. Dalton, former president, is now president of the Los Angeles Stake Relief Society, and Frances Willardson is president of the Beverly Hills Ward. South Sanpete Stake (Manti, Utah) CLARICE B. TUTTLE, former president of the South Sanpete Stake Relief Society, submitted a newspaper report of the very successful centennial observance held by the three wards of Manti, and also a report from the three Ephraim wards. The Manti Messenger contained the following account of the Manti celebration: Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday [March 15, 16, 17, 1942] were gala days for the Relief Society organizations of Manti, culminating years of untiring and ceaseless effort directed toward building a bigger and better organization, an effort which has been crowned with glorious success. Officers and teachers have worked energetically to prepare the three-day celebration in honor of the centennial observance of the L. D. S. Relief Society. Their efforts resulted in one of Manti's most elaborate celebrations, enjoyed by old and young of the entire community. Commencing Sunday night, a cantata, \"Resurrection Morning,\" written by B. Cecil Gates, was presented to the general public by the Singing Mothers of the three wards, under the direction of Cleo Christensen, with Mrs. Louise Hulme at the piano. Mrs. Bernice B. Keeler and Mrs. Leona F. Wintch were the readers. Before the cantata, Mrs. Clarice B. Tuttle... Gave a speech of welcome. A salute to the Relief Society was given by President Leland E. Anderson, the response by Mrs. Merle Poulson, president of the Center Ward Relief Society. Mrs. Viola Tatton was in charge of decorations. Monday afternoon a reception and program was held in the Center Ward Chapel, with so many in attendance that benches and chairs would not suffice. A fashion show depicting styles from 1842 to 1942 was directed by Mrs. Ruby K. Riddle.... Mrs. Alfreda Nielson was in charge of the music and refreshments. Monday night a married folks' dance was held in the Armada. It was one of the biggest dances of the year, and one of the most enjoyable. Many of the dancers came in costumes, which varied in kind and color from the humble overall to the dignified Prince Albert, and from the house dress of years gone by to the colorful gown of the gay nineties. Tuesday morning, a throng of people visited the temple, where the Singing Mothers furnished the music. Tuesday afternoon and evening in the Manti Theatre a pageant, \"By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them,\" written by Moroni Smith of Richfield, was presented. Mrs. Ada Dyreng was in charge of the pageant, assisted by Mrs. Edna Allred and Mrs. Blanche Garbe. Taking part in the pageant were sixty people. Singing for the pageant was done by the Singing Mothers directed by Mrs. Cleo Christensen. The three-day Ephraim observance was also very successful. The first session was held Sunday evening, March 15, in the tabernacle, under the direction of Anna Rasmusson  NOTES FROM THE FIELD 35 FIRST EPISODE OF PAGEANT, \"BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM,\" MANTI WARDS, SOUTH SANPETE STAKE RELIEF SOCIETY Leona F, Wintch, Relief Society General Board member, is in front row, center, representing Emma Smith; on her right is Winston Crawford representing Joseph Smith e FOURTH EPISODE OF PAGEANT, \"BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM,\" INCLUDING SINGING MOTHERS WHO SANG FOR THE PAGEANT of the stake board. Seventy-five Singing Mothers wearing white blouses made an impressive sight when they sang \"Resurrection Morning.\" They were assisted by Melba Armstrong, conductor, and Phylis Armstrong, accompanist. 'The stage setting was appropriate for the rendition of the cantata. The bishops of the Ephraim North, South and West Wards offered the prayers and also assisted backstage. Under the direction of Olivia Anderson of the stake board, general chairman, the activities on Monday afternoon featured a relic display, modeling of old hats and costumes of long ago, dancing of the minuet, and singing of old-time songs. \"Sister-cake\" with its cardamon flavor, peppermint candy, dried apples, and punch were served by ladies in costume. Tuesday, March 17, members from the Ephraim West Ward attended the morning session at the Manti Temple. In the afternoon, three inspirational episodes were enacted under the supervision of Vera Erickson of the stake board. They were: first, dramatization of the organization meeting of Relief Society; second, an episode emphasizing the importance of attendance at Relief Society, in which was dramatized the story of two young women who never 'found time to support Relief Society; and, third, a pantomime of nations coming through a membership arch. After this episode, candles on a centennial cake were lighted. This cake was made of seven pounds of popcorn. According to the report from the Ephraim wards, the costs incurred in conducting this three-day celebration were very low. Anna Rasmusson is now president of the South Sanpete Stake. CENTENNIAL CANDLE-LIGHTING CEREMONY Brigham City Third Ward Relief Society, Box Elder Stake  DEPARTMENT Sheology and Sestimony \"Articles of Faith,\" By James E. Talmage Lesson 15 The Book of Mormon (Continued) Article 8: \"... We also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.\" (Tuesday, April 6, 1943) Condensation of Chapter XV of Articles of Faith by Talmage (This condensation is placed in the Magazine in the hope that it will result in more class members familiarizing themselves with the lesson.) The Authenticity of the Book of Mormon The authenticity of the Book of Mormon constitutes our most important consideration of the work. Announcing to the. World the message of a departed people, written by way of commandment, and by the spirit of prophecy and revelation, this book is entitled to the most thorough and impartial examination. The Latter-day Saints base their belief in the authenticity of the book on the following proofs which will be discussed: 1. The Nephite and the Jewish scriptures are found to agree in matters of tradition, history, doctrine, and prophecy which the separate records treat. In a careful comparison of the prophecies of the Bible with corresponding predictions contained in the Book of Mormon, each of the records is corroborative of the other. 2. Ancient prophecy has been literally fulfilled in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Enoch (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:59- 62), David (Psalms 85:11), Isaiah (Isaiah 45:8), and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37), as well as other prophets knew and prophecied of the book. Ezekiel 37:15-17, reads: \"The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions [signifying the Bible]: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions [signifying the Book of Mormon]: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.\" 3. The internal consistency of the Book of Mormon sustains belief in Page 57 its divine origin. The parts bear evidence of having been written at different times and under widely varying conditions. The book maintains consistency throughout; no contradictions, no disagreements have been pointed out. 4. Among the most conclusive proofs of the authenticity of the book is that furnished by the demonstrated truth of its contained prophecies. The predictions contained within the Book of Mormon may be classed as (a) prophecies relating to the time covered by the book itself, the fulfillment of which is recorded therein; and (b) prophecies relative to times beyond the limits of the history chronicled in the book. Prophecies of the first class named are of minor value as proof of the authenticity of the work; nevertheless, to the conscientious reader the genuineness of the book will be made apparent in the literal realization of the numerous and varied predictions relating to the fate, then future, of the people whose history is given in the record. Prophecies of the second class are numerous and explicit. Many of them have special reference to this last dispensationthe Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. Among the most remarkable Book of Mormon predictions incident to the last dispensation are those that relate to its own coming forth and the effect of its publication amongst mankind. Joseph's great prophetic utterance is to be found in part in II Nephi 3:11-13. The literal fulfillment of this prophecy in the bringing forth of the Book of Mormon through Joseph Smith is well evidenced. That the new scriptures would be rejected by the Gentiles was known by Nephi, who recorded this: \"A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.\" (II Nephi 29:3; read the entire chapter.) 5. The archeology and ethnology of the Western Continent contribute some corroborative evidence in support of the Book of Mormon. Among the most significant of the discoveries respecting the aboriginal inhabitants of the land, are the following: (a) that America was peopled in very ancient times, probably soon after the building of the Tower of Babel; (b) that the continent has been successfully occupied by different peoples, at least by two classes, or so-called races, at widely separated periods; (c) that the aboriginal inhabitants came from the East, probably from Asia, and that the latter occupants, or those of the second period, were closely allied to, if not identified with, the Israelites; (d) that the existing native races of America form a common stock. It is very apparent that each of these discoveries is fully sustained by the Book of Mormon record. Let not the reader of the Book of Mormon content himself with such evidences as have been cited concerning the authenticity of this reputed scripture. There is promised a surer and more effectual means of ascertaining the truth or falsity of this volume. Like other scriptures, the Book of Mormon is to be comprehended through the spirit of the scripture, and this is obtainable only as a gift from God. But this gift is promised unto all who shall seek it. Then to all let us commend the counsel of the last writer in the volume, Moroni, solitary scribe who\nsealed the book: \"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with\n59\nreal intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\" (Moroni 10:4-5)\nLESSON PLAN\nLesson Aim: To prove the authenticity of the Book of Mormon\nSuggested Material Outline\nI.

It is suggested that class members who are capable and who do research well, be assigned, at least a month in advance of presentation, the five major sections of this lesson outline. In making such assignments, it is suggested that the class leader bear in mind the following procedure: A. Enough time should be spent with the class member assigned the task to make the assignment very clear. If necessary, the assignment should be written out by the class leader, and then the member should be given time to ask questions concerning her assignment. B. Class leaders should make the time limit explicit. This is very important if the lesson is fully covered in the time allotted. C. Class leaders should be responsible for seeing that material for use in the preparation of assignments is available. D. Some follow-through on the assignment should be made by the class leader to check on the progress of each assignment, and this should be done before the actual day of presentation. II. Class leaders should allow themselves time to summarize the major points of the lesson in order to make a unified whole and to increase learning. Part of this summary could be gathered from the class by skillful questioning. (Consult any book on teaching methods for help on how to formulate questions. If a blackboard is available, it would be helpful to list thereon the major points covered in the lesson.)\nReferences Roberts, B. H., A Comprehensive History of the Church, Vol. I.

No one can attain his highest usefulness, happiness, or intelligence, who injures his body by improper living. In the Doctrine and Covenants there are many revelations regarding the human body and its importance as an instrument of the mind. \"The spirit and the body,\" we are informed, \"are the soul of man.\" (Section 88:15) And in another place we read that the spirit manifests itself through the body. Therefore, the physical condition of the body either facilitates or hampers expression of the spirit. Such things as food, clothing, proper housing and living conditions\nare \"given to strengthen the body and enliven the soul.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 59:19) Section 88:124 gives instructions for the maintenance of the body. \"Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean;... Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.\" Then there is the Word of Wisdom (Section 89), which offers specific instructions: tobacco, \"strong or hot drinks,\" excessive meat eating are \"not good for man;\" while fruit in the season thereof is good for the use of man, and wheat is specially \"for man.\" Obedience to these teachings is attended by certain blessings. There are also revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants which indicate that the care of the body is a religious duty. The attitude of the mind and the emotions one cultivates have an effect on the health of the body. This fact was enunciated by Jesus and it\n*Discourses of Brigham Young, page 283, makes clear that President Brigham Young regarded tea and coffee among the hot drinks referred to in Doctrine and Covenants, Section 89.\n61\nfinds ample justification, if any is needed, in what we know from the study of the body. Christ assures us that fear, anger, hate, with kindred emotions, are a source of injury. He puts it theologically: \"Thou shalt not be angry with thy brother.\" But science gives us the reason. Says Herbert Spencer, in his Data of Ethics: \"From biology we learn that no act should be committed or thought entertained which weakens the body, for thereby the human being is rendered unfit for the duties of life.\" Obedience to the laws of health, both those revealed through religion and those discovered by man in his search for truth, express our faith in the teachings of the Church so far as concerns the sanctity of the body.\nDiscussion\n1. What should be the attitude of all citizens toward community health?\n2. In what ways can women cooperate with the civil authorities in maintaining healthy conditions in the community?\n3. Discuss Doctrine and Covenants 88:124, with regard to proper rest; also Gospel Doctrine by Joseph F. Smith, page 461.\n4. What are the physical effects of fear, anger, hate?\n5. What are the blessings promised those who obey the Word of Wisdom?\nWork-and-Business New-fashioned Thrift\nLesson 6 Clean Things Last Longer (For optional use on Tuesday, March 9, 1943)\nNOT only is \"cleanliness next to Godliness,\" but it is also economical. It is easier to keep clean than to make clean. Dirt wears things out, whether they be fabric, wood, plaster, leather, or fur. Good materials are entitled to good care. Waiting until they are very dirty before cleaning them means added rubbing and scrubbing that wears things out as much as does the dirt that is ground into them in the first place. While it is necessary to keep things clean to conserve them, it is also necessary in cleaning them to use the process best suited to the material or fabric involved. Some fabrics take kindly to mild soap and water, while others require dry-cleaning agents. The difficulty today is in knowing the material with which one is dealing. Rayon, the versatile fiber, is woven into a variety of fabrics; and since these fabrics are so extensively used, it is important to have a knowledge of their care. Some rayon fibers lose their strength when wet; others are dissolved when cleaning agents are used; and some are melted by the use of too much heat. The cleaning of any material containing rayon fiber depends on the nature of the weave as much as the fiber itself. Rough or creped surfaces should usually be dry cleaned. If material can be washed, the kind of soap, the temperature of the water used, the handling while wet, and the length of time given for drying are important items to remember. All fabrics of rayon, silk, and wool, whether used for clothing, upholstering, curtains, draperies, or rugs, require a mild soap, luke-warm water, little handling with no harsh rubbing or wringing. A long time is required for properly drying all of these fabrics except pure silk, which dries quickly. The amount of soap required will depend upon the harshness of the water, and whether or not a softening agent is used. Trisodium phosphate is a good detergent. Sheer fabrics when washed should be rolled in a soft absorbent cloth, such as a turkish towel, to absorb the excessive moisture, and they should be ironed with a warm iron while damp. Some fabrics, because of fineness, construction, or color, respond best to dry cleaning, and if done at home, extreme care should be taken in the handling of articles and in the selection of the cleaning agent to be used. Whether laundering or dry-cleaning method is used, stains should be removed from the article before the whole article is cleaned. The proper time to remove stain is when it is fresh. Air, heat, and water may change the character of the stain and make it difficult to remove, if it can be removed at all. It is much easier to remove a stain without injury to the fabric if the kind of stain is known. Most ordinary stains on tub-fast, washable materials, such as cotton or linen, can be removed with warm water; or in case of fruit stain, boiling water poured from a height. Stubborn stains, like ink, require special treatment.* Clothing and fabric articles that can be handled easily should be brushed often and regularly. Dust and dirt work into the meshes of the weave and cut the threads. The best time to brush clothing is immediately after wearing. Underwear and stockings should be washed often; fibers deteriorate with perspiration and body acids. In most homes, rugs and upholstery usually get a bigger share of the wear than other articles. To avoid some of this wear, they should have a quick daily cleaning, rather than to allow dust and dirt to work into the pile. A more thorough cleaning should be given weekly. The best cleaning implements to use are a vacuum cleaner and a carpet sweeper. Sweeping with a broom, especially against the pile, will further embed the dirt, and may tear or damage the soft, wool nap. Greasy spots and soil cause dirt to stick, which, in turn, dulls the colors. A good nonflammable cleansing fluid will brighten colors and remove spots. Some kinds of rugs and upholstery can be shampooed with safety if a thick jelly-like suds is made of neutral soap and applied with a brush using a circular motion. The lather should be scraped off with a dull broad knife, and then wiped off with a damp, clean cloth wrung out of clean warm water. This process should be repeated as many times as is necessary to remove all soap and soil. As little water as possible should be used. Articles should be allowed to dry thoroughly before being used. A thorough cleaning occasionally by an expert will prolong the life of such furnishings. Hard shaking of small rugs breaks the backing and unravels the ends or fringe. A rug laid on a smooth surface or over a pad not only wears longer but is easier to keep clean. If slip covers are used, they should be removed often enough for cleanliness and to make sure that moths do not lurk beneath them to feast on the precious fabrics of the davenport or chairs. Tablecloths, luncheon cloths, and\n*See America's Housekeeping Book, Chapter 25, p. 323.\nnapkins are made of various kinds of fabrics, such as cotton, linen, rayon, silk, and Cellophane. Linen and cotton, if white, can stand hot water; if colored, warm water should be used in washing. They should be washed quickly, rinsed thoroughly and, if white, dried in sun; if colored, they should be dried in the shade. Grass linen is stiff and should be handled carefully so as not to break the threads. Cotton and linen require a hotter iron in pressing than do other fabrics. Mats made entirely of Cellophane only need to be wiped with a damp cloth to clean. A bit of starch in the rinsing water will give cotton a gloss when ironed and keep it clean longer. Never use starch for other materials, especially linen. If ironed linens are rolled on a pasteboard or paper roll rather than folded, they keep fresh, clean, and wear longer. The folds in larger cloths should be changed occasionally to prevent wear along the line of the fold. Bedding should have its share of care. A clean, soft, but firm mattress, fluffy clean blankets, and clean sheets are inviting and help one to rest well. Soiled bedding is not nearly so warm as clean bedding. Regular airing and sunning of the mattress will keep it fluffy. A mattress should have a cover that fits snugly and that can be removed for washing. The rules for washing table linen apply also to bed linen. Over-washing of woolen blankets mats the\n63\nnap and causes harshness and shrinkage. Blankets will be fluffy and soft if dried out-of-doors on a mild, breezy day. Sheets hung straight and smooth on the line, dried, and then carefully removed and folded, need\n64\nnot be ironed other than to press the hems. Occasionally the wood of furniture needs a thorough cleaning with thick soap suds to remove the grime and smoke that collect and dull the beautiful surfaces. In modern heated homes, furniture gets too dry, which sometimes causes it to crack and come apart. If washed carefully, a small part at a time, without much water, wiped thoroughly dry with a soft cloth, and polished with a good furniture polish rubbed with the grain of the wood, the wood of most furniture will look like new, and the little bit of water used will help restore the moisture drawn out by overheated houses. Floors often become loose and squeak from the same cause. Floor surfaces should be kept clean, and the finish, whether oil, wax, paint, or varnish, should be well applied. This prevents the floor from wearing, whether it be wood, linoleum or tile, and is particularly important where floors receive great\nwear. Too frequent and too generous use of soap and water has a tendency to deteriorate rather than preserve some finishes. Each kind should have its own treatment. Paste, liquid or self-polishing wax are sometimes used too generously. When there is an accumulation of this wax, it should be removed; the floor should be thoroughly cleaned and new wax applied. Painted walls may be cleaned with a mild soap and water, or a water softener or solvent and water. They should be wiped well after washing. Long even strokes should be used when wallpaper and calcimine are cleaned with the dough-like preparations now on the market. Rubbing back and forth makes streaks and embeds the dirt in the paper. The main point to remember in cleaning all materials and articles is that they should not become too soiled.\nNOTE: America's Housekeeping Book, sections one, two, and three, pp. 131-335, contains a wealth of material on this subject."

Louise Yates Robison Seventh Relief Society President Lesson 7 (Tuesday, April 27, 1943) MORMON colonization has been characterized by the quality of the Saints who conquered the new wastes. Those men and women were strongstrong in muscle and sinew, in intelligence, in righteousness and faith. Such people were Thomas and Elizabeth Yates, an  LESSON DEPARTMENT English couple who helped to found Scipio, a small town in Millard County, Utah. Their daughter, Louise, was born May 27, 1866, while an Indian uprising was at its height. When the baby was five days old, neighbors lifted the bed containing mother and babe into a wagon, which they pulled into a stockade of logs that was also their meetinghouse. The Indians had killed three men of the small colony and had driven off all the horses and cattle. The Yates family survived these depredations as well as the hard labor which the primitive conditions required. Despite her years of toil, Mrs. Yates retained the gentility and refinement native to her character. Louise, like her mother, possessed the traits of a gentlewoman. She grew to be tall, slender, dignified and graceful. She was pleasant, softspoken, and mild of utterance. As a girl, Louise helped to wash, spin, weave, and dye woolen materials for her dresses. She knitted stockings, braided straw hats, and made flower. Trimmings. Louise Robison sometimes recalls the excitement in Scipio when President Brigham Young once visited there. The children wanted to strew flowers in his pathway, but blossoms were scarce. In the gardens they were lacking, although some house plants were in bloom. Louise stripped her mother's plants at the feet of the President. Brother Yates was bishop of Scipio, and his wife was Relief Society president of Millard Stake. Louise grew up in the wholesome atmosphere of a Latter-day Saint home, with the Relief Society influence its 73 dominant note. The family life was inseparably bound up with Church and community activities. Aiding her mother and the Relief Society, Louise gleaned wheat, gathered Sunday eggs to be sold for wheat money, helped the sick and unfortunate. The love of humanity and the spirituality she thus developed are the two outstanding qualities which she brought to the Relief Society presidency, and which were magnified with her years of service.

The oldest son, Harold, is a prominent physician in Los Angeles, while Rulon, a singer, teaches at the famous New England Conservatory of Music. MISTER ROBISON worked fist in the Mutual Improvement Association, then on the Granite Stake Relief Society Board, where she became counselor to the president. Brother Robison cooperated and encouraged his wife to do the Church work for which she was in demand. During World War I, Louise Robison became a Red Cross instructor and supervisor in the surgical dressings department. For outstanding services, she was honored with the emblem of the Red Cross, a beautiful pin. In 1921, President Heber J. Grant called Sister Robison to be second counselor to Sister Clarissa S. Williams, the new general president of Relief Society. Sitting in the audience when her name was presented, she was almost overcome with surprise. Because of her sympathetic nature and her exquisite needlework, Sister Robison was made chairman of the important burial-clothes department of the General Board. Able to express condolence in a delicate, tactful maner, she was a genuine comfort to the bereaved. Sister Robison took a special interest in home beautification, and through her enthusiasm and under the Society's direction trees and shrubs were planted and homes were improved. In view of Sister Robison's interest in furthering human welfare and happiness, she was chosen to represent the Relief Society at two conferences of the Travelers Aid Society and at three National Conventions of Social Workers, appearing on the program at one of them. Her reports of her attendance at 'the White House Conferences for Children breathe love and sympathy and a longing for improved conditions for the nation's young. In 1928, Sister Robison was appointed general president of Relief Society. She has traveled widely in the stakes and missions of America and in the missions of Europe, carrying messages of gladness, stirring people's hearts, arousing love and enthusiasm for the Gospel and its work. Her grace of manner, natural eloquence, kindliness, her remarkable memory for names and faces, her personal interest in Relief Society workersall have made her a most welcome visitor. At a World Congress of Women in Chicago, while the World's Fair was open, the president of the National Council of Women, Lena M. Phillips, appointed Mrs. Robison to preside at one session, which was attended by hundreds of women from all over the world. When a delegate to the International Council of Women in Paris, France, Mrs. Robison by request represented Lena M. Phillips at two meetings of the international presidents. Only the properly accredited women were admitted. While in Europe, Sister Robison visited Relief Societies in some of the branches in England, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, and Germany. Many of the Saints still hold her visit in precious remembrance. Sister Robison sponsored institutes in social welfare to teach Relief Society women better methods of caring for the poor. During Sister Robison's presidency a notable event occurred. A monument was erected by the Relief Society at Nauvoo, Illinois, to mark the site where Relief Society was organized March 27, 1842. This monument is of stone, four by eight feet, surmounted by two bronze tablets giving historical data of Relief Society. At the dedication ceremony, July 26, 1933, hundreds of people sat under spreading locusts, or stood nearby. Mr. W. D. Chenery of Illinois wrote in a newspaper there that \"Mrs. Louise Y. Robison, presided over the ceremonial with a graciousness and tact that might be the emulation 74 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEJANUARY 1943 LESSON DEPARTMENT of chairmen the world over.\" Another writer commented that her pleasing manner and ready wit caught the crowd, Another important project encouraged by Sister Robison, and one which became a very popular phase of Relief Society work in America and in the foreign missions, was the development of Singing Mothers' choruses. Sister Robison has done much temple work during her lifea work that has been for years one of her major satisfactions. 'The spiritual side of the-Gospel appeals to her nature. Late in 1939, when the General Boards of Relief Society and Primary 715 were reorganized, Sister Robison and her Board were honorably released. She was then asked to be an ordinance worker in the Salt Lake Temple, and took much pleasure in fulfilling that call. She is at present actively engaged in Relief Society work in San: Francisco Stake. She accepts many invitations to speak in wards and stakes. Sister Robison and her Board inaugurated the fouryear Relief Society membership campaign and carried it forward for two years. Her interest in this project continued throughout the campaign. The true spirit of the Gospel emerges in her voice and shines forth in her countenance.

Let me see your report card, Judith,\" he said. She gave it to him. \"Why, there's a mistake here. How is that?\" He used an eraser and a pen and handed the card back. A \"G\" was written where the \"P\" had been. \"Oh, thanks!\" Judith gulped and ran to her seat. Mr. Peterson looked hard at a book. Edna turned abruptly and walked out of the room, her back a rigid exclamation point of triumph and disgust. Judith caught a glimpse of her face as she turned to close the door. It was grey-white like snow in shadow. The group in the rear broke up, and Judith moved outside, too. No one wanted to talk. Afterwards the schoolroom was different. Mr. Peterson's attitude was impersonal, and a whole new world opened wide. There was so much to learn and so little time! Life grew exciting and happy again. Soon the feeling of expectancy, which was spring, rose on the air; and the hillside, still clothed in the shaggy grass of the autumn before, began to push through the snow. When the windows were open, Judith could hear the first water-song coming up from the sunny side of the bridge where the creek was creeping out of its cold, hard covering and bubbling over with freedom. The linnets alighted in the nearby trees and tossed up their tinkling notes: \"Happy greeting! Happy greeting!\" And there was a fresh, clean smell in the air as of rainwashed leaves or newly-laundered curtains. Then, suddenly, it was May; the Maypole dance was over, the pasture rolling down toward the creek from the schoolyard fence was warm and green and dotted with brassy little buttons of dandelions, and the final examinations were just around the corner. Now Judith sat on the summer grass remembering Edna Silver... Justice is a group affair, justice for: everybody, and everybody's concern.... Some folks unkind, but more who were selfless and lovable and great... Edna Silver. All these were hers in a wonderful country; and she had thought it was a new dress that mattered, but Edna had known. Her heart was packed to bursting with unformed dreams. This Night Mabel Jones Gabbott How beautiful this twilight hour! The day Is done. In roseate blue and gold and pink Apollo's fiery chargers seem to sink Beyond our small world's rim and speed away. Then softly, silently night closes in, The stilled sweet hush of ending day is near; Warm lights in little windows now appear, Dispelling shadows, 'circling joy within. And yet beyond the tinted line of sky And earth, beyond the sunset's afterglow, Great war clouds gather, flinging wild and high, Their dark and somber silhouettes of woe.

            "content": "Lucy Mack Smith\nTHE Magazine presents as its frontispiece a black and white copy of a colored drawing of Lucy Mack Smith, mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The colored drawing, in size about fifteen by twenty-four inches, was presented to the Relief Society by Elder George Albert Smith at the meeting of the Relief Society General Board held Wednesday, January 13, 1943. The circumstances surrounding the discovery of this valuable picture are very interesting. In September 1942, Elder George Albert Smith, in company with Elder Preston Nibley, stopped off on their way West to visit Nauvoo, Illinois, and nearby places connected with Church history. After visiting in Carthage, the brethren traveled thirteen miles to Colchester to call on the only living grandchild of Lucy Mack Smith and Joseph Smith, Sr., the parents of the Prophet Joseph Smith. This grandchild, Mrs. Clara Hendel, a lady eighty-one years old, is a daughter of the Prophet Joseph's youngest sister, Lucy Smith Milliken. On inquiry from Brother Nibley concerning pictures of members of her family, she showed a colored drawing of Lucy Mack Smith to these gentlemen, which she explained she had found among her mother's effects. Elder George Albert Smith assured the members of the family that he would greatly appreciate having a copy of the picture. They replied that they would procure a copy and mail it to him. A colored copy was received by Elder Smith in November, which is the picture he has so graciously presented to the Relief Society. The Relief Society is very appreciative of the gift and is happy to have a picture of this very remarkable mother, Lucy Mack Smith, who joined the Relief Society at its second meeting and gave counsel and support to the Society while it remained in Nauvoo. Note the Book of Mormon which Lucy Mack Smith holds in her hand, and the picture on the wall above her head of the Facsimile from The Book of Abraham, Pearl of Great Price. The picture was perhaps made during the nine years between 1846-1855. Elder Nibley is of the opinion that it was made during the time she resided with her daughter, Lucy Milliken, as it was found in the possession of Mrs. Milliken's daughter, Mrs. Clara Hendel.\nPage 79\nLucy Mack SmithMother of the Prophet Preston Nibley\nMOTHERHOOD is said to be the greatest honor that can be bestowed upon womankind in this world. The act of bringing forth an immortal spirit, clothed with a mortal body, is a woman's crowning achievement. Comparatively few women are denied this accomplishment. But only once in many hundreds of years is the privilege given to a woman to become the mother of a mighty prophet of God, whose life and labors are to change the destiny of a waiting world. Such an honor was bestowed upon Lucy Mack Smith, whose new-found portrait is reproduced as the frontispiece in this issue of TheIt was on July 8, 1776, that a daughter was born to Solomon and Lydia Mack, prosperous farming people of Gilsum, New Hampshire. In the home of these good parents Lucy was reared, with all the refinement and culture known to the inhabitants of western New England at that time. Before she had reached her twentieth birthday, Lucy had met and married a young farmer from Tunbridge, Vermont, named Joseph Smith. Joseph has been described to us as a tall, athletic, young man, an able and willing worker, kind and considerate, \"opening his house to all who were needy and destitute.\" Lucy has told us that at the time of her marriage her husband \"owned a handsome farm.\" She has also related that as a wedding dowry she was presented with a check for $1,000 by her brother Stephen and his business partner. Life began favorably for Joseph and Lucy Smith, yet little did they dream of the strange and extraordinary events which were before them, events which were to lift their names from obscurity into undying fame. Economically Joseph and Lucy Smith were not to prosper in this world. Through misfortune they soon lost their farm, and for a number of years they became tenant farmers in New Hampshire and Vermont. It was while renting a farm from Mrs. Smith's father, Solomon Mack, in Sharon Township, Vermont, that their fourth child and third son was born, named Joseph, Jr. Failing to reestablish themselves in Vermont, Joseph Smith moved his family to western New York in 1815, and located at Palmyra. Here and in the adjacent vicinity they remained for fifteen years. Here the boy Joseph announced his First Vision in the spring of 1820; here he told of the visit of the angel Moroni and the finding of the sacred record, and here the Book of Mormon was printed. Lucy Smith and her husband became the first believers in the visions and revelations which were vouchsafed to their youthful son. And with unsurpassed loyalty and devotion they stood by him in all his efforts to found \"the Church and\nLUCY MACK SMITH\nKingdom of God.\" They endured all manner of persecution: the scorn of the world, loss of friends, loss of property, and physical persecution, such as being forced to leave their home in Missouri in the midst of winter and flee across the snow-clad prairies to Illinois. Yet not once did they complain; not once did they lose faith in the divine calling of their son. When the Prophet was taken by the mob in Missouri in October, 1838, he was almost immediately sentenced to be shot. \"Several guns were fired, and the heartbroken parents supposed that the bloody work was accomplished.\" Mother Smith thus describes these moments: \"Mr. Smith, folding his arms tight across his heart cried out, 'Oh my God! My God! They have killed my son! They have murdered him, and I must die, for I cannot live without him.\" Through some strange miracle the lives of Joseph and Hyrum were spared at this time. They were carried to Richmond for trial and from thence to Liberty. \"At their departure from Far West, the heart-stricken mother pressed through the crowd to the wagon containing her sons, exclaiming: 'I am the mother of the Prophet: is there not a gentleman here who will assist me to that wagon, that I may take a last look at my children, and speak to them once more before I die?' With her daughter Lucy, she gained the wagon and grasped Joseph's hand, which was thrust between the cover and the wagon-bed, but he spoke not to her until she said: 'Joseph, do speak to your poor mother once more. I cannot bear to go until I hear your voice.' At this he sobbed out: 'God bless you, mother; and while his sister Lucy was pressing a kiss on his hand, the wagon dashed off.\" (Jenson, Andrew, L. D. S. Biographical Encyclopedia, Vol. 1. P. 691) On September 14, 1840, at Nauvoo, Illinois, in the seventieth year of his life, the good father died, \"worn out by the exposures he had suffered in Missouri.\" Lucy Smith was now left without the companionship of \"a tender and loving husband.\" Yet further misfortunes were to come to her. In the summer of 1841, her youngest son, Don Carlos, died after a brief illness. Three years later, there occurred at Carthage, Illinois, the tragic murder of her sons Joseph and Hyrum. Her poignant grief and sorrow at this time are well expressed in her own words: \"I was swallowed up in the depth of my afflictions,\" she writes, \"and though my soul was filled with sorrow past imagination, yet I was dumb, until I arose again to contemplate the spectacle before me. Oh! At that moment how my mind flew through every scene of sorrow and distress which we had passed together, in which they had shown the innocence and sympathy which filled their guileless hearts. As I looked upon their peaceful, smiling countenances, I seemed almost to hear them say, 'Mother, weep not for us, we have overcome the world by love; we carried to them the Gospel, that their souls might be saved; they slew us for our testimony and thus placed us beyond their power; their ascendency is for a moment, ours is an eternal triumph.'\" (Smith, Lucy, Joseph Smith the Prophet, p. 278) Joseph the Prophet and Hyrum the Patriarch will never have a more sincere and inspiring tribute than this, given to them by their dear old mother as she stood beside their coffins in the Mansion House at Nauvoo that June day in 1844. As if she had not suffered sufficiently in the loss of her husband and three grown sons in the short space of four years, Mrs. Smith was called upon to part with another son, Samuel Harrison, less than five weeks after the death of Joseph and Hyrum. In fleeing from the mob at Carthage he had overexerted himself. In a few weeks he fell ill and died. Of the six sons Mrs. Smith had reared to maturity, only one now remained, William, who had shown himself to be the least capable of rendering aid and assistance to her. Such was the fate of this good woman. At the last General Conference of the Church held in Nauvoo, in October 1845, after President Brigham Young and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve had decided to lead the Latter-day Saints to a new home in the West, Mrs. Smith asked the privilege of addressing one of the meetings. I find the following in the Journal History: \"Mother Lucy Smith, the aged and honored parent of Joseph Smith, having expressed a wish to say a few words to the congregation, she was invited upon the stand. She spoke at considerable length, and in an audible manner, so as to be heard by a large portion of the vast assembly. She commenced by saying that she was truly glad that the Lord had let her see so large a congregation. She had a great deal of advice to give, but Brother Brigham Young had done the errand; he had fixed it completely. There were comparatively few in the assembly who were acquainted with her family. She was the mother of ten children, seven of whom were boys. She raised them in the fear and love of God, and never was there a more obedient family. She warned parents that they were accountable for their children's conduct; advised them to give them books and work to keep them from idleness; warned all to be full of love, goodness and kindness, and never to do in secret, what they would not do in the presence of millions. She wished to know of the congregation whether they considered her a mother in Israel? (upon which President Brigham Young said, 'All who consider mother Smith as a mother in Israel, signify it by saying \"yes.\"' One universal 'yes' rang throughout.) She remarked that it was just eighteen years since Joseph Smith the Prophet had become acquainted with the contents of the plates; and then in a concise manner related over the most prominent points in the early history of her family; their hardships, trials, privations, persecutions, sufferings, etc., some parts of which melted those who heard her to tears....\" Regarding the migration of the Saints westward, she continued: \"I feel the Lord will let Brother Brigham take the people away. Here in this city lie my dead, my husband and children; and if it so be the rest of my children go with youand I would to God they may all gothey will not go without me; and if I go, I want my bones brought back in case I die away, and deposited with my husband and children.\" Here President Young interrupted to say:\n\nLUCY MACK SMITH\n\"Mother Smith proposes a thing which rejoices my heart: she will go with us. I can answer for the authorities of the Church; we want her and her children to go with us; and I pledge myself in behalf of the authorities of the Church, that while we have anything, they shall share with us....I pledge myself, if mother Smith goes with us and I outlive her, I will do my best to bring her bones back again, and deposit them with her children, and I want to know if this people are willing to enter into a covenant to do the same?\" (There was a unanimous vote favorable to President Young's request.) It is well known that Mother Smith, in spite of her expressed wish on this occasion, did not make the journey westward with the Saints. Perhaps she was dissuaded therefrom by her son, her three daughters, and the Prophet's wife, Emmaall of whom remained behind. She lived nine years after the Saints evacuated Nauvoo in the spring of 1846, and we know little of her history. Brother Andrew Jenson has written that she spent seven years of this time at the home of her youngest daughter Lucy Smith Milliken, and the remaining two years with the Prophet's wife, Emma, in her comfortable home at Nauvoo, where Lucy Mack Smith died on May 5, 1855.\n83\nIt is difficult for us to understand what thoughts passed through Mother Smith's mind during the last years of her life. She had been the first to listen to the story of the visions of her son; she had witnessed the organization of the Church and its rise; she had followed the Saints in all of their trials and difficulties and persecutions; as the mother of the Prophet, she was always respected and honored by the Saints. Then with swiftness came the events in Nauvoo: the death of her husband, the death of her four sons, and the removal of the great body of the Saints westward. Her last years were spent with her family. There was no congregation of Saints with which she could mingle; there was no preaching of inspired prophets which she could hear. And yet she held fast to her belief and her testimony. No truer Latter-day Saint ever lived than this good mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith. She was loyal to him in life and in death. In the portrait used as a frontispiece for this issue of the Magazine she is shown holding the Book of Mormon in her hand, and she looks fearlessly and calmly into the future, with the firm assurance that this sacred record and the revelations given to her gifted son are God's revealed truth."

            "content": "Brotherhood Elder Harold B. Lee Member of the Council of the Twelve\nIN sacred Jewish writings a parable is told of a man who saw in the distance an object that he supposed was a beast. As the object drew nearer he saw it was a man, and as it came still nearer he exclaimed, \"It is my brother.\" Seldom do we see as the beast the man we really understand, for with closer association and a clearer understanding of the impulses and the circumstances that impel men to action we become more tolerant and more forgiving. If we could but learn the lesson taught by that parable there surely would be less of misunderstanding and of faultfinding, less of hatred and contention, less of strife and of bloodshed, but more of sympathy and forgiveness extended toward him who errs. The word \"brotherhood\" in common usage suggests a society or a fraternity of individuals or of groups banded together for a common purpose. More often than otherwise such purpose is selfish and the benefits of the society are limited to only those who comprise the group, and frequently the objective of the society, if achieved, works to the disadvantage or to the actual detriment of those outside of that brotherhood. Whether it be of individuals or of nations the principle is the same. We see before us today the awful spectacle of a devastating war between groups of nations, bound to each other within their own allied\nPage 84\ncouncils by solemn agreements, prompted not by mutual respect or admiration for each other, but impelled by a fear of each other or by a hope for selfish gains as the result and in the event of ultimate victory to their side. It should be clear to any thinking person that the promotion of such \"brotherhoods\" so-called, usually only serves to perpetuate strife, and that decisions arrived at between such groups are dictated by the force of might rather than on the basis of justice and equity. The establishment of a peace in the world that will be everlasting and so much to be desired will be possible if and when mankind can unite together in some kind of a fraternity where such brotherly relationships are characterized by love and affection. Some time ago there appeared in the New York Times a scholarly article prepared by a conference of eminent Catholic bishops entitled \"Pronouncement by Catholic Bishops on Church and Social Welfare.\" The article dealt with the contending views of capital and labor and boldly criticized each faction for the evident selfishness and short-sightedness in their present plans and policies. Then it outlined a suggested course to be followed in order to overcome the conflicting views that presently exist. Here are the concluding words: \"There must be a reform of morals and a profound renewal of Christian spirit.... To\nBROTHERHOOD\ndo that it is argued that our economic life must be reorganized, and selfishness must be replaced by justice and charity.\" The answer of the Master to the question, \"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?\" runs to the same conclusion. \"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" (Matt. 22:36-39) A brotherhood that seeks to establish the common good is but as \"sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal\" except it be founded upon the divine principle of love of God and our neighbor as ourselves. One who says he loves God and is a follower of Jesus and yet hates his brother is false to himself and before the world, for no one can love God whom he has not seen and yet love not his brother whom he has seen. (I John 4:20.) The truest evidence that one loves God is that he keeps His commandments. (I John 2:3-4.) And if the loving of one's neighbor is the \"second great commandment\" then a brotherly relationship with our fellow men must be the measure of one's Christian standing. The logic of this reasoning is amply supported by the scriptures where the Lord is declared to be \"the God of the spirits of all flesh\" (Numbers 27:16), and is compared as the Father of our spirits to the fathers of our flesh to whom we give reverence. (Heb. 12:9.) Such a conception of the Fatherhood of God declares also a universal broth-\n85\nerhood of man. In such a family relationship, a love of a son for the Father and yet hatred of that son for others of his Father's offspring is hardly conceivable to the reasoning mind. To understand that man is created in the image of God is a soul-stirring contemplation, and every soul that hath this hope in him purifieth himself. (I John 3:3.) But what is necessary for one to discharge his responsibility toward his fellow men? This same question was undoubtedly in the mind of the lawyer who asked Jesus \"And who is my neighbor?\" In reply Jesus gave a parable (Luke 10:30-37): And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him. And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves? And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. The moral of the Master's lesson is clear: He only is neighbor who does good to him who is in need.\nThy Neighbor\nWho is thy neighbor? He whom thou Hast power to aid or bless. Whose aching heart or burning brow Thy soothing hand may press. Thy neighbor? 'Tis the fainting poor, Whose eye with want is dim; O enter thou his humble door With aid and peace for him.\nTHE influx of many strangers within our gates and the industrialization and militarization of many of our pastoral communities might well cause us to ponder the question as to our responsibility as neighbors to these strangers. Our pioneer parents, led by inspired leaders, came to this western land to establish \"the mountain of the Lord's house in the top of the mountains.\" A prophet had declared that many people should say, \"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,\" and also that the inhabitants of the House of the God of Jacob were to teach these newcomers \"of his ways and to walk in his paths.\" (Isa. 2:2-3.) To the Latter-day Saints the Lord has entrusted a great responsibility as the keepers of the House of the Lord thus established. Paul, the great missionary apostle, defined the purpose of the establishment of the Church of Christ as being for \"the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith....\" Since the time when Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt the principle of gathering the members of the Church into communities has been taught. The Latter-day Saints have been taught this principle by revelations from the Lord. Here, in such communities, without hindrance or molestation from those who refuse to accept fellowship in the Church and Kingdom of God, it has been found that the members of the Church thus established can better work out their social, economic and religious problems than would be possible without such gathering. If, to satisfy the critics of the practice of the Latter-day Saints in gathering together for mutual improvement, we were to encourage promiscuous social intercourse with the stranger regardless of his standards and by so doing sacrifice the ideals of morality, of marriage, and of family for which our parents sacrificed much, we would not only be untrue to our heritage but we would thereby decrease immeasurably our power \"to do good to him that is in need.\" Obedient to the command of the Master, reiterated in our generation, we have sent and will continue to send missionaries not only to carry the Gospel to the stranger within our gates but to \"every nation, kindred, tongue and people.\" And for what purpose? To welcome all \"who fear God and give glory to Him\" to accept membership in the greatest \"brotherhood\" in the world, the Church of Christ established in the last days. Can one conceive of a greater service to be rendered to those who may come to us than to bring to them the opportunities and privileges of the Gospel and into fellowship with those who live righteous lives? To you who would administer succor and be a neighbor to the poor and the needy, I would bid you heed the inspired admonition, \"and though I bestow all my goods to\n\nBROTHERHOOD\nfeed the poor,... And have not charity, I am nothing.\" (I Cor. 13:3.) It would be well if all who dispense charity would do so with a reverent appreciation of their divine relationship to that one so assisted and do it in a manner suggested by the Savior's declaration, that as you would do it unto one such needy you would do it as a service to him. (Matt. 25:40.) In all such ministering it is well to remember that there are broken hearts and wounded souls among us that need the tender care of a brother who has an understanding heart and is kind. Today there may be heard again in Israel the voice of a Rachel \"weeping for her children, and would not be comforted because they are not\" when the cruel blasts of war shall bring the sad news of disaster. She must be soothed with tenderness by sisters worthy to bear the name of this great brotherhood of saints. May the \"kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come,\" (D.& C. 65:6) that\n87\nGod's \"will be done in earth as it is in heaven.\" (Matt. 6:10.) May we let our lights so shine (Matt. 5:16) as members of the Church of God that others seeing our good works and that we are not of the world (John 15:19) will come to seek membership therein. May we sense the fact that true love for our neighbor consists not in descending to his level but rather in so living that we aid him in an upward climb. May we never forget that in this great fellowship, our ears must ever be inclined to hear the cry of the widow and the orphan and that in our ministrations to all such we do as we think the Master would have us do. Thus, if we do, and if we teach others to do likewise, ours will be the brotherhood to fill the whole earth and bring about that peace on earth when the powers of darkness will be eternally bound with the everlasting chains of righteousness at the hands of God's children.\n\"Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair; the rest is in the hands of God.\" George Washington, Speech to the Constitutional Convention (1787)\n\"The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the republican model of government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\"George Washington, First Inaugural (1789)"

It wasn't because she felt weak or defeated, judging herself as an actor in the life she had led. Rather, it was the realization that she had never been truly herself, and now it was too late. For sixty years she had heard the song of the untouched West with its inscrutable mountains, but she had never tried to sing or paint or write it. She had not used what was finest within her; in fact, she had never been an artist at all. And now she was old. The young Sheila she had beenwith her perky red curls and quizzical blue eyesseemed to stand literally before her faded gaze. She shook herself and crossed to the mirror over her dresser, pressing calloused palms to her creased cheeks, noting the grooves in her forehead and neck. Wind and the open plains had made her fair skin as dry as parchment. Studying the swollen veins of her hands, she saw youthful, tapering fingers reach across the strings of her aunt's harp in Dublin, her aunt who had been a celebrated musician and whose harp Sheila was to have inherited when she became eighteen. But when that birthday had arrived, she had looked across the scorched fields of Zion, to which her parents had fled ten years before, and thought of tapestries and a stately harp whose strings were silent, now that her aunt was dead.\nPage 88\n\"I should have done better,\" thought Sheila bitterly; \"I let little things crowd it all out.\" She thought of the garden, the children, the endless housework, and of her mother's long illness. \"Why did I have such a heritage?\" she asked. Then she looked at the picture of Colleen on her table and once more made a solemn resolution: Little Colleen, with the harp of Dublin hidden in her bosom, was going to have a chance to sing. \"Are you ready, Aunt Sheila?\" It was Elsie's warm voice calling from the kitchen, and thoughts of youth and unfulfilled longings fled. \"Yes, I'm ready, my dear,\" Sheila replied; and tying a white scarf over her thinning gray hair she went out to the shady front porch. The poplars were casting thin shadows across the patch of lawn; the wide stretch of fields was still. Suddenly, from some unseen spot, came the clear call of a meadow lark. Gerald, Elsie's husband, was taking good care of the farm now that John was gone! The front door of the small house beyond the garden opened and John's sister Maggie appeared. She followed slowly the narrow path between the two homes and climbed the steps of the larger dwelling with jerky effort. \"Maggie is old,\" thought Sheila\"really old.\" Elsie came out, crisp and cool in her blue organdy. \"Gerald said the rehearsal went fine last night,\" she said with enthusiasm. \"He thinks the pageant's going to be great.\" \"Weel, they'll hae to do some fancy acting if they come up to Sheila'sand that a lang time ago,\" replied Maggie dryly. Sheila made a gesture of remonstrance, but she looked pleased. \"Young folks must have their day, Maggie. And don't you forget that Colleen is going to sing tonight.\" She squeezed her handbag tight against her breast, for it held Colleen's stirring little note: \"I must see you tomorrow, Grandma! I must! I have something important to tell you.\" Something important! Could it be an offer? Why, Colleen had had only a year of real training. Maggie was describing to patient Elsie the wonders of Sheila's performance in Hazel Kirk. \"There, there,\" cried Sheila with pretended petulance, \"let the past be!\" But Maggie was bubbling with reminiscences. \"Your Uncle John was over-proud of her, Elsie,\" she said ruefully. \"He was sae proud that I sulked. It's nae pleasant for a sister to be shoved aside by a weebit wife.\" The laugh that had risen in Maggie's throat broke off and ended in a sigh. Both old women thought of John sleeping beside his first wife, the gentle English girl who had not survived the rigors. After a pause Maggie's thin voice rose again. \"Your Uncle John was nae the mon to let a bit o' stubborn land get the best o' him, Elsie. He dug out rocks to build his house and brought water down from the mountain for his fields.\"\nBLANCHE KENDALL McKEY\n\"Uncle John was a thrifty man,\" corroborated Elsie. \"Aye,\" said Maggie, \"and masterful. He had Ireland in his household, but he meant to hold his ain.\" She screwed her wrinkled face until it gave a distorted impression of roguishness, cast a challenging glance at her sister-in-law, and waited for a sharp retort. But Sheila seemed to be unconscious of the prattle. Elsie noted her melancholy detachment with rising apprehension. Old people were so moody and hard to understand! When they should be gay they sank into the depths. \"Come, now, Aunt Sheila,\" she pleaded. \"Tomorrow's the Twenty-fourth! They're putting on this pageant for people like you. Think of all you've done for the town.\" Her eyes swept the stretches of corn, wheat and alfalfa, the tops of farmhouses in the valley, the paved road which led to the recreation hall where the pageant was to be given. \"No one has done more good than you have, Aunt Sheila.\" Sheila would have liked to talk to the sympathetic Elsie if she had thought the younger woman could understand. In her unhappy condemnation of what she had done with her talents she felt the need of love. That was why Maggie's praise had sounded so sweet. She would gladly have confessed that she felt herself to be a flat failure but for a deep-sunk timidity. Elsie was young and didn't know enough, whereas Maggie was old and knew too much. So she threw them both a Mona Lisa smile and hugged tight the thought of Colleen. Elsie plucked playfully at her aunt's sleeve and shook her bobbed head as though she were still a girl. \"No one can go on acting and singing forever,\" she tactlessly comforted. Sheila smiled again, her glance unlighted; then her lids fell as she caught the significance of Maggie's canny remark: \"She's not greetin' for the songs she can sing nae more; she's greetin' for the songs she niver hae sung.\" Good heavens! Was there nothing that the heart could hide? Such piercing seemed almost immodest. With an effort she lifted her gaze to find Maggie smiling at her fondly. After all Maggie loved her. She felt a painful little clutch at her\n89\nthroat. Then she let her great eyes rest illuminatingly on her sister-in-law's face, fell in with the family dialect and said amicably, \"Aye, lass.\" Elsie ran down the steps impatiently, looking up the road. \"Gerald should have been here with the car twenty minutes ago,\" she exclaimed. \"Something has held him upprops, I suppose. It will spoil the whole evening if we have to rush in at the last minute.\" HALF-HOUR later, seated comfortably in the front row of the balcony which afforded the best view of the stage and so had been reserved for honored guests, Sheila attempted to subdue her rising excitement. Was Colleen nearly ready? Would she have a moment to slip upstairs before the performance? Suddenly she heard a quick step coming down the aisle, and almost before she could turn she heard Colleen's whisper. \"Move over, Grandma. I only stay a second.\" Sheila shuffled. Into the seat reserved for the president of the Relief Society and Colleen slipped down beside her. \"Look, Grandma!\" 'Timidly she thrust out her hand on which shone the loveliest diamond the old lady  had ever seen. She lifted her eyes to study the girl's face. \"It had just come when I wrote the note yesterday. Bob and I are going to be married.\" \"Bob?\" wavered Sheila. \"Bob Brownell. Surely you tremember Bob.\" Sheila hadn't thought of Bob Brownell in a long time. With an effort she recalled an apple-cheeked bo \"He s been away to medical school, you know, for nearly four years.\" Colleen's voice trembled a little. She glanced at twotiny wings pinned over her heart. \"Bob and I saw a good deal of each other when I was at school last winter.\" Her hand pressed the small insignia. \"Now he's in the Air Corps.\" Can  SILENT STRINGS Sheila felt a throbbing in her own breast. Little Colleen's hero was offering his life for his country! In a moment the tremulous voice came again. \"['m not going back to the Conservatory in the fall, Grandma. I'm going to make bullets. II've got to help.\" Sheila saw the glisten of heavy tears and felt empty herself. She knew that Colleen wanted to speak further, but couldn't. \"Tt's all right, dearest,\" she whispered close to the wet cheek. \"T could never have gone to the Conservatory at all if it hadn't been for your money. And you didn't have any too much yourself. I know that. And you expected so much of me.\" \"It's all right; honestly, it's all right.\" But Colleen was struggling to make a clearer explanation. \"II have to helphelp Bob and the Red Cross and the farmers and everything that means America. You pioneers built such a wonderful country. We wouldn't be worth the dust of the plains if we couldn't protect it. I can't just study music not this year.\" And Sheila could only reiterate that everything was all right. After Colleen had hurried away, leaving perfume and remembrance of youth behind her, Sheila was doubly thankful that some of Maggie's old cronies had carried her off to sit with them. Absent-mindedly ~ she heard their laughter rise above the babble of talk around her. The balcony became crowded and boys began placing chairs in the aisles on the floor below. The small orchestra 91 filed in. Smiling, the Relief Society president took her seat beside Sheila and became absorbed in her officers sitting on her right. Sheila was grateful beyond expression to be let alone. Little Colleen and her shining diamond! Her courage and faith in America! It was queer the way life surged along. She thought of her years with John. If he had been able to love her as he had loved the wife of his early youth, would that have lessened her sense of unfulfillment? She thought of all she and Maggie and John had given to the land before it had begun to yield. She recalled her mother's privation, felt her horror of famine, and sat as though gripped in the silence of death. And as an accompaniment to the pageant of her mind, she heard the plaintive throbbing of the harp she had renounced. Sheila was so deeply stirred before the curtains parted that the ensuing scenes shook her to her depths. The portrayal of the long trek; handcarts inching through sand; weary voices singing, \"And if we die before our journey's through\" She scarcely knew what was her own dream, what was acting, and what was reality. Then with a little shock she was conscious of Colleen standing all alone on the dim stage at the foot of a covered wagon. Her auburn hair was demurely parted and arched by a small black bonnet. Her tiny waist was compressed into an unyielding basque. Her skirt, fluted and puffed here and there, fell to the floor. Plain white collars and cuffs softened the severity. Then, without accompaniment, her clear tones filled the hall: O my Father, Thou that dwellest In that high and glorious place, When shall I regain Thy presence, And again behold Thy face? Throughout the four verses she held the audience motionless; she was part of the sleeping encampment, part of the covered wagon, part of the endless plains, and of the still, unresponsive night. And all at once Sheila knew, with the true intuition of a born artist, that her people were too close to their struggles, too young in culture for a great expression. But some day a man or woman would look over the fertile fields of Utah and Idaho and see the land as it was primevally, ringing with the whoop of the Indian, the beat of the buffalo, and the shrill cry of the mountain lion. Or he would look at the imperial mountains and interpret with brush or pen their awful aloofness. It wouldn't be her heart strings aquiver, nor was it likely to be Colleen's. But some day it would come, for a great movement demands a great reproduction, and the message of her hills and plains had never been fitly expressed. And when the painting or play or novel came, her tears would be in it, and her yearning, for she and her parents and John and their friends had made a great work possible. But little Colleen, like Sheila herself, could sing the song of Zion \"in a strange land.\" 'Tears on the girl's rounded cheeks: Then at length, when I've completed All you sent me forth to do   Sheila's questioning eyes were lifted and for a moment she sat breathless. \"O God,\" her heart whispered, \"the redemption of man! After all, wasn't that the song of Zion?\" She knew that this was true, and knew also that the brush of Michelangelo, the imagination of Milton, and the pealing of an organ in a great cathedral could only suggest the beauty of a soul returned to God. With unconscious dignity shielded by the darkness, Sheila bowed her head. In a moment of realization she was paid for what the years had taken from her. She felt hot drops falling upon her folded hands, but the stabbing regret was gone. SHADOWS Roberta Bates Twilight and the shadows of the stars Fall soft and deep Into the stillness of a murmuring sea; So soon my shadow will have fallen Fallen deep Into the quiet darkness of eternity.  George D. Pyper Milton Bennion Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union, passed away January 16, 1943. Funeral services were held in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square, in Salt Lake City, on January 19. All members of the First Presidency, the majority of the General Authorities, the Sunday School Union Board, and a host of friends and admirers of Superintendent Pyper were in attendance. Brother Pyper had been an xecutive officer of the Sunday School Union Board for more than forty years. He had also served the Church, the state, and the local community in many other capacities. He was endowed with very superior artistic abilities but his artistic interests and attainments in nowise curtailed his business and administrative abilities. This was manifested in his long and successful term, as manager of the Salt Lake Theatre and in his management of numerous pageants, musical and dramatic performances, and publications, many of which he either wrote or edited. (Guaeen D. PYPER, General In his youth and early manhood he served as clerk and later as judge of the Salt Lake City police court. This experience induced him to study law. These studies were, however, interrupted by a call to an extensive missionary tour in the company of Elders B. H. Roberts and Melvin J. Ballard. Numerous subsequent calls by both Church and state to important positions prevented Brother Pyper from resuming his legal studies. ELDER GEORGE D. PYPER To his intimate associates he was best known as a courteous, kind, sympathetic, and understanding friend; he was, indeed, a friend of man. While he was deeply religious, there was in him no trace of the pharisaical attitude so frequently denounced by Jesus. While he attended to all the details of the precepts of the Church, he emphasized the \"weightier matters of the law\"  justice, kindness, and integrity. His character was, in fact, the embodiment of these virtues. He had ever in mind the greatest of all the commandmentsthe love of God; this he expressed in the love and service of his fellow men. When they were in trouble they came to him for assistance with assurance that this assistance would be given to the limit of his ability. Page 93 To Marry or Not to Marry in Time of War Dr. Harold T. Christensen Brigham Young University MILLIONS of young men and women are asking themselves this question today. In the midst of the uncertainties and the fears of total war, they are wondering what to do about marriage, and for the most part they are confused. The problem is not an easy one and young people are not the only ones who are confused. The many decisions surrounding marriage are difficult enough in normal times, but these difficulties are multiplied and magnified enormously in times of war. War is a crisis in the family institution; patterns of life are changed so fundamentally that courtship and marriage as usual, is simply out of the question. It is hazardous to advise in times like these, for the chance element is great and no one understands very well what the immediate future holds. But hazardous or not, it is important, so that in planning for the future we can be guided by knowledge and understanding as far as is possible rather than by impetuous feelings of recklessness and desperation. The spirit of this article is that of analysis and suggestion rather than preachment or dogmatic pronouncement. 'There is no one formula that will fit all cases and answer all questions regarding war marriage; the decision to marry or not to marry is after all an individual matter depending upon the personal values and external circumstances Page 94 involved in each case. But the decision should nevertheless be an intelligent one, based upon serious thought and a consideration of the factors involved. Our purpose is not to decide the question of war marriage once and for all, but to present some facts and arguments which may aid each person in making his own decision. The Impact of War The repercussions of modern war are felt throughout the entirety of society; no single phase of our social structure, including the relationships of man to woman, escapes. In understanding the problem of marriage in wartime it might be helpful to review briefly some of the effects of the present war upon the family institution: (1) In the first place, marriage, divorce, and birth rates have been greatly accelerated, although it is reasonably certain that this acceleration will be temporary only. Marriages have increased for a number of reasons, running all the way from a desire to escape the draft to either an increased emotionalism brought on by the war, or to a realization that it may be \"now or never.\" Because of recent military regulations, marriage for draft evasion is not as common as it was earlier. Undoubtedly many marriages do take place today, however, due to war hysteria in one form or another. The atmosphere of war is charged with emotionalism; the glamour of the uniform, plus a love for adventure and a feeling of uncertainty in the future, all tend to increase irrational behavior, such as rushing into marriage without adequate thought or preparation. Furthermore, with millions of our boys in the armed services, some of them never to return, there is often the feeling that unless one can marry now he may never have the opportunity later, and hence the tendency to \"grasp at straws\" in near desperation. It is well known that many women never married following World War I because there were not enough men left to go around (there were more than four million surplus women in the marriageable ages in Germany, France, and England alone), and it is realized that a similar condition will follow this war. In gambling with the future many young men are making sure of the marriage experience before they die, and many young women are saying that if worst comes to worst they would rather be a widow than a spinster anyway. The birthrate has increased as the natural accompaniment of the expanded marriage rate, plus a conscious motivation in some instances, such as draft evasion, the desire on the part of the husband to leave a progeny in case of death, or on the part of the wife to have something to remember her husband by. The divorce rate has increased very likely because more people have more money to finance the divorce proceedings, and also because changes necessitated by the war effort often create family tensions. With millions of men armed services for in the considerable the period of war. Lengths of time, we can logically expect marriage, divorce, and birth rates to fall rapidly in the very near future and to remain low throughout Likewise, with the return of many of these men after the war, it is reasonable to expect a new increase in all of these rates before they again settle down to a somewhat normal level. This was the experience of World War I, and we can expect it again. (2) A second change brought about by the present war is the loosening of moral standards and the lowering of moral conduct. Unfortunately, the rigors and the brutalities of war tend to dull the finer sensitivities of men and, with some at least, to sever the ties binding them to a strict moral course. The normal sex ratio is disturbed in war, placing both males and females of marriageable ages in abnormal environments. 'The male in service is removed from the stabilizing influence of those he knows best and loves, and at the same time is thrown into situations not the most wholesome. The female at home finds courtship competition more difficult because of the shortage of men, and will often lower her standards in order to more successfully compete. And coupled with all this is the hysteria of war mentioned above. Service men are frequently made to feel that loose conduct is expected of them, and girls that it is patriotic to cater to the man in uniform. Many are blindly and selfishly indulging excessively in worldly pleasures on the sad theory that they must have their fun while they can. \"Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we may die,\" they are saying, and as a result TO MARRY OR NOT TO MARRY IN TIME OF WAR 95 morals are given a holiday. It is to avoid temptations such as these that some choose to marry. (3) Another effect of war, and the last that will be discussed here, is the weakening of family bonds and the' consequent growth of family instability. Military life tends to unfit the man for home life after the war; separation of husband and wife for long periods during the war permits misunderstandings and infidelities to creep in, leading toward greater maladjustment later; and when the wife works, she gains a new individualism and financial independence that she may not be willing to yield after the war. The growth of nurseries for the care of children belonging to working mothers, is one noticeable indication of declining family functions in the wartime.\nThe Pros and Cons of Marriage\nNo one will argue that all marriages should stop in wartime, and likewise no thinking person will justify all of the marriages that take place under the stimulation of war. Marriage is too important an institution to be sidetracked, even for total war; the future of society demands that it have a position of priority. But marriage in time of war is not only continued, but it is expanded and often perverted as well; hasty unions, ill-planned and artificially lived, are in many cases doomed for failure. The question, then, is not, \"Should there be marriage in wartime?\" but rather, \"Who should marry and when?\" And the question is a debatable one. As we have already said, there is no one answer that will fit all cases; each person will need to weigh all factors that are involved in his or her particular case, including personal feelings, but not allowing these alone to sway his judgment; and then with his eyes open he should make his own decision taking his chances with the uncertainties of the day. When such notables as Lewis Browne and David Seabury disagree on the advisability of marriage in wartime, it is evident that the problem is a tough one and that the arguments are not all on one side.* Those who favor war marriages usually do so on the grounds that, even though these carry more risks than do marriages in times of peace, risky marriage is better than no marriage at all. It isn't quite fair, they argue, to expect a young person who has planned his future in terms of family life to forego all of this without a try. Thousands, possibly millions, of young men will never return from the battle front, and, through waiting, an equal number of young women will be left without partners in marriage. Why not enjoy the marriage experience before going away to war, they say, thereby insuring the consummation of love although necessarily gambling on the continuance of the marriage state. In addition to this they point out that marriage tends to stabilize those who enter, giving each something to live for, work for, and die for, if necessary. Contentment and clean living during separation are said to result from the assurance that somewhere there is a husband or wife who cares. Opposed to these arguments are those which make war marriage look\n*America's Town Meeting of the Air. \"Will War Marriages Work?\" Reader's Digest November 1942, pp. 14-18.\n\nlike a very risky business. While happy marriage is certainly better than no marriage at all, it is said, unhappy marriage is not, and the probability of unhappiness in war marriages is great. Heightened romanticism and feelings of desperation brought on by the hysteria of war both tend to make marriage a hasty and impetuous affair. In times past girls have asked all sorts of questions concerning their prospective husbands; questions such as, \"What family does he come from?\" and \"How well educated is he?\" but now altogether too many are simply saying, \"Where is he?\" During war neither boys nor girls are as discriminate in choosing a mate as in other times, and they are usually in a bigger hurry to have the marriage performed. All of this means insufficient acquaintance and inadequate preparation for marriage, which in turn means greater marriage failure. Furthermore, long periods of separation between husband and wife, separations which usually follow a hasty wedding and an all too brief married experience, are not conducive to successful marriage adjustment. Worry, misunderstandings, suspicions, and temptations all enter in to frustrate the separated spouses and to make the durability of their union less likely. If neither death nor desertion prevents a reunion of mates following the war there are other casualties that may prove just as bad. If the husband returns home maimed or diseased in some way, for example, the prospect facing a young wife in becoming the caretaker of an invalid for an indefinite future is not a happy one, particularly if the spouses were practically strangers when they married, had little time to get acquainted and become adjusted immediately following marriage, and have grown farther apart through long separations and contradictory experiences. Then too, the dangers regarding infidelity and the cooling or changing of affections toward each other must not be forgotten. Entering marriage impetuously, without preparation, and without the opportunity of normal home life together, make a rather poor combination of circumstances to insure marital happiness, it is argued. And in support of this contention one need only consider the great increase in the divorce rate following every important war.\nFactors in Making the Decision\nWith these arguments in view, and with a knowledge of his own personality traits, feelings, and desires, each young person will make up his own mind as to whether he will marry or not in wartime. But it is hoped that in each case the problem will be intelligently and prayerfully considered before the decision is made, so that the possible consequences of the alternative procedures will be thoughtfully realized and courageously faced. In the spirit of self-analysis the following questions should be asked: (1) Are you well prepared for marriage with each other? If the desire to marry is prompted largely by the war emergency so that you won't \"miss out on anything\" it is likely that your motives are more those of desperation than of love and companionship. Studies show that marriage is more likely to be successful where the couple has been acquainted for a number of years and has been engaged for a long enough time to adjust and to prepare for what is to come. Unless you have been fairly well acquainted over a considerable length of time, be just a little wary of your motives and also those of your sweetheart. It may be that you are mistaking reckless emotionalism, or military glamour, or mere desperation, for the \"real thing.\" Haste makes for waste even in the marriage game; and it is far better to think first so that \"repentence at leisure\" will not be necessary. But if you are ready for marriage, and if this readiness has been tested by both time and thought, you may consider it best to accept the hazards of war without letting them change your marital plans. (2) How long will you be able to live together after marriage before the war separates you? The start of any marriage is the most crucial from the standpoint of mutual adjustment in laying foundations for harmonious living, and unless husband and wife can be together for a reasonable period after marriage and under somewhat favorable circumstances they are starting under a handicap. But because of military policy you may not know exactly how long you can be together. In such circumstances the best you can do it to take a chance and do what seems best after other factors are considered. But certainly where you know that you can be together for only a few days, or even a few weeks, you will realize the handicap. Sometimes the wife is permitted to live close to the military camp where her husband is in service, and in this way be with him occasionally. This is often the best solution possible, but even at best it is frequently none too good. High rents, crowded living conditions, frequent movings, and infrequent visits together put them both under strain and make home life difficult if not impossible. (3) Will you be able to finance the marriage? Poverty and economic insecurity are drains on anyone's happiness, even in marriage. This is an important question at any time; but since economic uncertainties are greater in wartime, it becomes all the more important then. With the husband in military service will the wife have adequate financial support? In the event of a child will there be enough to care for them both? (4) Are you willing to accept the inconveniences and the risks involved? If wives are true to their husbands during separation in wartime they will find themselves either staying home or going out without partners, and husbands will similarly find their social life limited. Can you \"take it\"? Can you be separated and yet maintain the morality and the fidelity required in holy wedlock? Are you strong enough and brave enough to accept the casualties of war should they come to you or yours, and to readjust to whatever the war may leave you? Unless you are mature emotionally, and are brave, the hazards of marriage in wartime may be too great for you. These are serious questions, but they are important for those who are thinking of marriage in this day. Many thousands of the war marriages taking place now are doomed for failure because of the haste and impetuous emotionalism that is bringing them about. But on the other hand, a great many of today's marriages will be happy ones because they were preceded by the thoughtful and prayerful preparation that is ever important, whether in time of war or of peace. By multiplying the uncertainties of the future, war does make marriage more of a risk but it certainly does not preclude the possibility of success. Nonmarriage is better than marriage failure, and if the hazards of war make failure seem imminent in any particular case then that marriage should not be performed. But marriage need not fail, not even in wartime, if preparation has been complete enough and the persons involved are big enough to do their part. That is the answer. Latter-day Saints will let the doctrine of eternal marriage help them solve this all important question. Marriage in wartime should be considered with all the seriousness of purpose as in peacetime, and preparation may be considered as incomplete if the couple is not ready for a temple ceremony. Not even total war justifies a marriage of convenience.\nBibliography America's Town Meeting of the Air. \"Will War Marriages Work?\" Reader's Digest, November 1942, pp. 14-18. Bossard, James H.

In the midst of the uncertainties and the fears of total war, they are wondering what to do about marriage, and for the most part they are confused. The problem is not an easy one and young people are not the only ones who are confused. The many decisions surrounding marriage are difficult enough in normal times, but these difficulties are multiplied and magnified enormously in times of war. War is a crisis in the family institution; patterns of life are changed so fundamentally that courtship and marriage as usual, is simply out of the question. It is hazardous to advise in times like these, for the chance element is great and no one understands very well what the immediate future holds. But hazardous or not, it is important, so that in planning for the future we can be guided by knowledge and understanding as far as is possible rather than by impetuous feelings of recklessness and desperation. The spirit of this article is that of analysis and suggestion rather than preachment or dogmatic pronouncement. 'There is no one formula that will fit all cases and answer all questions regarding war marriage; the decision to marry or not to marry is after all an individual matter depending upon the personal values and external circumstances Page 94 involved in each case. But the decision should nevertheless be an intelligent one, based upon serious thought and a consideration of the factors involved. Our purpose is not to decide the question of war marriage once and for all, but to present some facts and arguments which may aid each person in making his own decision. The Impact of War The repercussions of modern war are felt throughout the entirety of society; no single phase of our social structure, including the relationships of man to woman, escapes. In understanding the problem of marriage in wartime it might be helpful to review briefly some of the effects of the present war upon the family institution: (1) In the first place, marriage, divorce, and birth rates have been greatly accelerated, although it is reasonably certain that this acceleration will be temporary only. Marriages have increased for a number of reasons, running all the way from a desire to escape the draft to either an increased emotionalism brought on by the war, or to a realization that it may be \"now or never.\" Because of recent military regulations, marriage for draft evasion is not as common as it was earlier. Undoubtedly many marriages do take place today, however, due to war hysteria in one form or another. The atmosphere of war is charged with emotionalism; the glamour of the uniform, plus a love for adventure and a feeling of uncertainty in the future, all tend to increase irrational behavior, such as rushing into marriage without adequate thought or preparation. Furthermore, with millions of our boys in the armed services, some of them never to return, there is often the feeling that unless one can marry now he may never have the opportunity later, and hence the tendency to \"grasp at straws\" in near desperation. It is well known that many women never married following World War I because there were not enough men left to go around (there were more than four million surplus women in the marriageable ages in Germany, France, and England alone), and it is realized that a similar condition will follow this war. In gambling with the future many young men are making sure of the marriage experience before they die, and many young women are saying that if worst comes to worst they would rather be a widow than a spinster anyway. The birthrate has increased as the natural accompaniment of the expanded marriage rate, plus a conscious motivation in some instances, such as draft evasion, the desire on the part of the husband to leave a progeny in case of death, or on the part of the wife to have something to remember her husband by. The divorce rate has increased very likely because more people have more money to finance the divorce proceedings, and also because changes necessitated by the war effort often create family tensions. With millions of men armed services for in the considerable the period of war. Lengths of time, we can logically expect marriage, divorce, and birth rates to fall rapidly in the very near future and to remain low throughout Likewise, with the return of many of these men after the war, it is reasonable to expect a new increase in all of these rates before they again settle down to a somewhat normal level. This was the experience of World War I, and we can expect it again. (2) A second change brought about by the present war is the loosening of moral standards and the lowering of moral conduct. Unfortunately, the rigors and the brutalities of war tend to dull the finer sensitivities of men and, with some at least, to sever the ties binding them to a strict moral course. The normal sex ratio is disturbed in war, placing both males and females of marriageable ages in abnormal environments. 'The male in service is removed from the stabilizing influence of those he knows best and loves, and at the same time is thrown into situations not the most wholesome. The female at home finds courtship competition more difficult because of the shortage of men, and will often lower her standards in order to more successfully compete. And coupled with all this is the hysteria of war mentioned above. Service men are frequently made to feel that loose conduct is expected of them, and girls that it is patriotic to cater to the man in uniform. Many are blindly and selfishly indulging excessively in worldly pleasures on the sad theory that they must have their fun while they can. \"Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we may die,\" they are saying, and as a result TO MARRY OR NOT TO MARRY IN TIME OF WAR 95 morals are given a holiday. It is to avoid temptations such as these that some choose to marry. (3) Another effect of war, and the last that will be discussed here, is the weakening of family bonds and the' consequent growth of family instability. Military life tends to unfit the man for home life after the war; separation of husband and wife for long periods during the war permits misunderstandings and infidelities to creep in, leading toward greater maladjustment later; and when the wife works, she gains a new individualism and financial independence that she may not be willing to yield after the war. The growth of nurseries for the care of children belonging to working mothers, is one noticeable indication of declining family functions in the wartime.\nThe Pros and Cons of Marriage\nNo one will argue that all marriages should stop in wartime, and likewise no thinking person will justify all of the marriages that take place under the stimulation of war. Marriage is too important an institution to be sidetracked, even for total war; the future of society demands that it have a position of priority. But marriage in time of war is not only continued, but it is expanded and often perverted as well; hasty unions, ill-planned and artificially lived, are in many cases doomed for failure. The question, then, is not, \"Should there be marriage in wartime?\" but rather, \"Who should marry and when?\" And the question is a debatable one. As we have already said, there is no one answer that will fit all cases; each person will need to weigh all factors that are involved in his or her particular case, including personal feelings, but not allowing these alone to sway his judgment; and then with his eyes open he should make his own decision taking his chances with the uncertainties of the day.

Orchard of unfailing fruit, Grape and apple, herb and root, Of all the wealth that gardens give Whereby man may eat and live. Here, in fellowship, agree Pleasure and utility.\nTHUS did the ancient poet Asinius, celebrate in verse the praises of home gardeningand today, almost two thousand years later, gardens again have become important contributors toward the pleasure, safety, and comfort of family and national life. The 1943 home garden will play an important role in our country's mighty program of war, for gardeners too have been called to arms, but our weapons will be the digging fork and the hoe. We must polish off these trusty weapons and prepare to plant as never before; we must make every small bit of earth in our possession produce \"all the wealth that gardens give whereby man may eat and live.\" We must not only raise flowers, but fruits and vegetables as well, for food, we are told, will play a leading part in winning victory. Every row of carrots or tomatoes we can raise and use at our family table will mean just that much more food for our boys on the fighting fronts throughout the world. Our country must produce tremendous quantities of extra food this year to send to our Allies as well as the starving millions of the war ridden earth. And every home gardener must accept the call, and should soon be at\nPage 100\nwork preparing plans for an all out Victory Garden. The home owner who has vacant ground which lies out in full sun and can be reached by water, can make an important contribution toward our victory, for such a piece of land can easily supply fresh vegetables for an entire familynot only the essential potatoes, onions, beets, and carrots, but many other less familiar and equally desirable additions to our daily bill of fare. Vegetables give us one of the finest sources of the all important vitamins, and we must cultivate a taste for new and untried varieties to help add both valuable food and variety to our meals. The owner of the ordinary city lot can also find space for growing vegetables. This was amply demonstrated in Salt Lake City gardens last season when flowers and vegetables were combined, to the enjoyment and gain of many home gardeners. It was plainly demonstrated that there is no need to dig up existing flower gardens, lawns, or shrubberies in order to have vegetables. One enthusiastic garden lover converted a small space at the rear of her home into a combined vegetable and flower garden where she planted rows of vegetables and edged them with annuals, gladioluses and dahlias. Tomatoes and cucumbers were trained on trellises at the rear where they not only made charming backgrounds, but produced fruits of finer flavor, color, and size, than those allowed to grow in the usual mannersprawling on the ground.\nGARDENING FOR VICTORY\nCurrant, raspberry, and blackberry bushes were also planted as shrubs, making handsome foliage plants while at the same time supplying their delicious fruitsnote that each of these does well in shady spots. Almost every garden can find room for growing a few bushes to contribute their fine fruits for the table. Everbearing strawberries were also used in this bounteous garden to give a colorful edging and to provide the owner with this toothsome delicacy from late June until November, while the grapevines that had been set out earlier to make a charming arbor over the entrance to the garden, bore more than a bushel of grapes. Planted two years ago, this small space now produces the year's supply of vegetables for an entire family with some to spare for neighbors and friends, all produced in a space no larger than many that are lying vacant and waste behind the garage on many home properties. Not only does this versatile garden spot give a bounteous crop of eatables, but it also supplies quantities of flowers for all occasions, not to mention the renewed good health and enjoyment derived from its making by its mistress. There are some home gardeners, however, who find no unused spaces for such a venture. Nevertheless, it is quite possible to find room, right among the flower beds, where many kinds of vegetables will thrive. For instance, carrots, beets, lettuce, and parsley make good looking edging plants, and by planting them in front of taller growing flowers in sunny and open parts of the garden, they not only are decorative,\n101\nbut they supply plenty of vitamins. Do not, however, seed your entire spaces at once, but plant a few short rows at a time, then add other plantings at two-week intervals, thus supplying yourself with a constant source of tender young crisp carrots and beets from early summer until late November. Unless the family is a large one, it is best to make small sowings often so that the crop will not all mature at once. Early radishes can be planted right out among the perennials on the very first day of springlong before the unused ground can be dug and prepared for planting. They will thrive and mature very quickly in the well worked and enriched soil of the flower beds, and will be eaten long before the flowers get really started into active growth. Radishes grow to perfection in earliest spring, and successive sowings can be made for several weeks right in the flower beds in any small vacant spots. Last season several city gardeners even boasted of the tender ears of corn that were raised in the sunny open parts of their flower gardens, making bold and handsome background plants, while one Salt Lake City matron won praise and prizes with the tomatoes which she grew among the aristocratic blooms of her rose garden, the two seemed to get along right well together. Green kale was another vegetable which was used to make a decorative planting, but which also proved unusually successful as an added and toothsome green for the dinner table. This bears handsome curly green leaves, and tastes oh, so good when served cooked like spinach or for soups or salads! And several gardeners set out pepper plants, both the green and the vivid red variety, in open sunny spots among the flowers with the best of results. Pole beans were also found to be easily grown and most profitable, furnishing a long season of good eating, and making very good tall plants for the rear. These need a stout stake upon which to climb, while the bush varieties make low bushy plants for any dry sunny corner, and bear fresh pods during the entire summer if kept picked. It should be remembered that all vegetables need and must have sun and plenty of air. Do not expect them to thrive in shady places. Cultivate the soil as soon as each kind germinates, and continue this attention if you wish them to develop well. This not only keeps weeds down, but conserves moisture, and produces excellent crops of high quality flavor. In fact, if you have never enjoyed strictly fresh vegetables, fresh from the garden to the pot, then you have a real thrill in store, for nothing is more delicious eating than really fresh young vegetables. You will find new flavor in every kind you grow. But we must also say a word for flowers, for these too will be important in the Victory Garden. We will need their sweet charms to comfort and bring cheer amid all the turmoil, and yes, perhaps the sorrows of wartime. Nothing has been found that will speak the message of love and courage so eloquently as a flower. We will need our flower gardens in which to work and find the peace and tranquility which is so lacking in the rest of the world. Wartime means little in a flower gardeneach flower goes its own sweet and mysterious way, blooming as punctually and as sweetly as usual no matter how chaotic the world may be. Here alone, all is orderly and calmthe sounds of turmoil only a distant hum. Here, without pang one sees Ranks, conditions and degrees. We must keep up our lawns, even though they are but tiny plots of green, and we must not neglect our shrubs, our flower beds, and our sheltering trees. We will need them as never before to help our morale during these trying times. We must cling to them as part of our way of life. Here is safetypeace and love attend you Here by the lattice along the wall The very trees stretch out green arms, as though they would defend you. \"The Garden,\" Henri de Regnier."

            "content": "The Road Builder Rita Skousen Miller\nWhen next you look at a beautiful highway, well built, or a vigorous life well lived, think of the builderhis dreams, his labors, and his joy.\nTHE initials were still there all right. Large and calloused middle-aged hands pulled away some weather-beaten bark, and kind, faded, blue eyes strained to make out the faint, stained letters that he already knew, \"W D L,\" William Dean Lanyon I. Tall pines rose all about him and mountainous growth almost enclosed this little spot. At only one point could he look out and up to the piercing blue sky fringed with reaching pines and down to the rugged canyon and rocky mountainside. There he stood at this moment. It was here beside the great tree that that other Lanyon had stood those many years ago and made his mark upon its trunk. It had been just about this time of yearwhen the worst storms were due and one could feel them coming in the air. The train of saints from Missouri had been anxious to get over the mountain pass and into the Valley. Big Bill Lanyon, the two Minter boys, and three others had spent four days forcing a trail for the covered wagons through the thick underbrush in the bottom of the canyon. Early storms had already covered the trail blazed by the first group of saints through the other pass, and this was their only chance to make the Valley this year. As the signal had gone through for the wagons to start into the canyon, Big Bill Lanyon hadn't gone back but had pulled his horse to the left. After a few yards up the side of the mountain, Big Bill had dismounted and pulled his way slowly up through the timber until he had reached this spot, high and remote and quiet. Then he had thrilled as he suddenly faced the great expanse of bright blue sky with its background of distant threatening clouds against the rough, rugged mountain. As he had looked down he could see the tiny wagons as they labored slowly into view. The low roll of the train and sound of moving cattle came faintly up to him. And the Minter boys were singing again. How the Lord had blessed them! None had known the real tragedy of their situation when the storms to the north had cut them off. All would know when they reached their destination that the Lord had directed them through this pass in time. They had built a good road! Triumphantly it wound and clung to the side of the mountains on the floor of the canyon, and Big Bill's pride excited him as he looked at the thing they had made. With their teams they had fought the big boulders in their way. In fact, the whole journey had been extremely tedious and difficult. Jim Narden was still unable to rise from his wagon and the two little Leland girls were getting worse. There were others. But at last they were nearing their destination! At that moment Big Bill's\nPage 103\nheart swelled within him in gratitude and there so high above that little moving caravan, for one fleeting moment, he felt close to the heavens. Then he had carved his initials in the trunk of the great tree and with another look had turned and made his way down the steep slope.\nEIGHT years later, Big Bill had come back to the great tree with his young son. They had struggled happily up the mountain together and Little Bill had clung to his father's hand as they suddenly came upon the lookout and all that it held. Big Bill had pointed out the dusty road far below. How proud he had been! \"To be a road builder, my son,\" he had said, \"is a great task. We must have roadsroads to make life a little easier for our friends and loved ones. Roads to help us accomplish the great responsibilities ahead for us here in this Valleyroads to create a great nation and a great people.\" Little Bill had listened as he looked at the narrow ribbon. A wagon had appeared and then disappeared again in a film of billowing dust. \"You see, son, learn to create things that people can use and enjoy.\" Then after awhile father and son had laughed and eaten a little lunch under the great tree, and Big Bill had told stories until the sun had set behind the great mountain. William Dean Lanyon I was gone now but here was another Big Bill, a Big Bill that remembered a day spent on this spot many years ago. And the initials were still there. Not as clear by any means but still there, like the words that had been spoken that day. Big Bill looked down into the still rugged canyon. There it wasfinished at last. Its wide expanse wound triumphantly around the mountainside like a beautiful, smooth, satin ribbon. This Big Bill, too, had battled the mountain, blasting solid rock day after day to make way for the steam shovels and trucks. Gradually, great crags and boulders and the loose, touchy mountainside had been first broken, then supported, and then subdued, until now a magnificent highway layquiet and ready and something he had made, but not alone. Beneath the perfect, smooth surface lay a rough little road created with teams and hand picks and another's dreams. Big Bill had not forgotten, nor would he. At the remembrance the scene grew misty, and in his imagination he could almost hear the low rumble of wagon wheels; but then he looked again, coming into view was a train of huge trucks, earth-green United States Army trucks and they carried supplies. The procession was perfect and orderly. Curling Yes, we must have roadsroads to keep a great nation and a great people, roads to make life possible for our friends and loved ones, roads to help us accomplish the great responsibilities ahead of us here in this nation. Then Bill thought of his four sonshappily. They were building roads, beautiful, brilliant ones. One was building his in the sky, another in the sphere of government, another on the sea, another in the mission field. How the Lord had blessed\n\nTHE ROAD BUILDER\nhim! His heart swelled in gratitude and high above the floor of the canyon for one fleeting moment Big Bill felt close to the heavens. Even as he had used the trail, oh might his sons use this lovely almost living thing far below him, and all that he and the Church had taught them to\n105\nbuild a greater way to a better world and a kinder one! Large and calloused middle-aged hands pulled away some of the weather-beaten bark and this very day, if you can find the spot and look closely, you will see the initials of two great men carved together. When next you look at a beautiful highway, well built, or a vigorous life well lived, think of the builderhis dreams, his labors and his joy."

            "content": "How Grownup Are You In Your Attitude Toward the War? Mark K. Allen, Psychologist, Utah State Training School\nTHE great reservoir of human nervous energy within us, is, of all the vast resources of our nation, undoubtedly the most precious. Unfortunately, it is often the most carelessly squandered unwittingly. What are some of the common ways we waste this energy? How do our opponents attempt to dissipate this precious resource? How can we preserve it best for the national good? Most adults, though they have reached mature stature, have not put away all childish attitudes. These immature attitudes carried into adult life waste vital nervous energy. Because a temper tantrum in a child is wasteful of his nervous energy, and that of others, we try to teach him the more efficient habit of cooperation with others. The difficulties almost everyone experiences in adjusting socially under relatively normal conditions are a measure of his emotional maturity. Under the severe stress of the war emergency, all of one's inefficient wayshis personality maladjustments or childish attitudesbecome more apparent. Bad dispositions may become worse under stress; an unhappy marriage adjustment may grow intolerable; the poor homemaker may come upon even harder days. All of our childish tendenciesblaming others, grumbling over inconveniences, for exampleshow up in our general inadequacy to make a happy and wholesome adjustment to the emergency. We pointed out in a previous ar-\nPage 106\nticle how enemy propaganda is calculated to waste our energies through creating fears, confusion, and class feelings among ourselves. Fears and confusion which smolder but do not lead to positive action are extremely wasteful of our energies. Bombings and destruction are aimed at wasting the energies of the people, as well as material resources. Think of the man-hours of labor wasted through the time and worry spent by workers in air raid shelters alone. Blockade and destruction of food supplies is another vicious weapon aimed at wasting energy through hunger and malnutrition. Fears flourish more rapidly in the presence of fatigue and hunger. So our opponents hope for us to waste our reservoir of nervous energy through fear, confusion, class hatred, fatigue, and malnutrition. Our opponents have made no secret of their hope and belief that the American people will not endure the hardships of war. They do not doubt that we have tremendous natural resources, but they do doubt our willingness to revise quickly our indulgent habits. Japanese leaders have spoken pointedly of the \"spoiled child\" mentality of the Americans, claiming that good living has made us soft. It was no accident that cutting off almost all of the rubber supplies we enjoyed was one of the first objects of the Japanese military campaign. We are just beginning to realize the sacrifice that stratagem requires of all of us. Japan is confident we \"can't take it\" without wasting our energies through whining and resentment. Of course, our task today is to show how badly our opponents have misjudged the ability of the average American to adapt to his difficulties.\nHOW GROWNUP ARE YOU?\nThere are many special conditions incident to our war effort which will cause further waste in our energies. These conditions affect all of us in varying degrees today, and they are likely to become more serious as the war continues. They challenge the emotional maturity of all of us. First, there are innumerable inconveniences and annoyances which interfere with our habitual way of living. There are many shortages of goods that are more annoying than directly vital to existence: sugar, metal goods of all kinds, silk, and especially rubber and transportation facilities. The nervous exhaustion over these small matters is often more than over major affairs, Adolph Myers, eminent psychiatrist, tells us. How sensibly we adapt to these matters is a good indication of how grownup we are. Our government's relation to us in these regulations is like that of parents to their children in matters of everyday discipline. But since we as adults are so accustomed to not being strictly regulated, we have some painful habit revision to undergo. These annoyances call upon us for a mature and patient forbearance. The plumber fails us, resulting in all degrees of serious consequences; the clerks at the stores are inexperienced; deliveries to our homes are rapidly becoming unavailable at a time when we can drive our automobiles to only a very limited extent.\n107\nThe telephone service for civilians is greatly reduced in efficiency, domestic help is almost unobtainable. Tradesmen of all kinds are becoming very independent in serving us. Many of the consumer goods we are able to buy are of inferior quality. All of these daily annoyances add up to a considerable waste of one's vital energies, if we permit them toas our opponents hope we will. Most of us can find a simple salvation from these annoyances and shortages by remembering that \"misery loves company.\" When all women must wear hose not so sheer and lovely, perhaps no one will feel so badly. Business failure in a depression is not so painful as during prosperity, because we have plenty of company in our misery. Already we humorously measure social status, not by noting how new one's automobile is, but by looking at one's tires to see how many miles he still can go. The pain of minor deprivations is largely social. When we are all affected more or less alike, we may even see something amusing in the struggle of millions of people over their little misfortunes. Then there are the shortages just apparent on the horizon which are a more serious foreboding. Some essential foods are becoming dangerously scarce; and while we in America are not seriously threatened with famine, we may undergo some genuine hardships before many months. Meat and dairy products are already threatened. Fuel shortages already have many a household shivering. The acute housing shortage in defense areas is definitely more serious than the annoyances mentioned above. Limited medical and hospital facilities are already entering the acute stage in some rural and \"boom\" communities. These conditions may necessitate severe sacrifices and much mature resourcefulness in adjusting to them. Malnutrition from actual shortages has not affected us seriously so far. But one wonders how much systematic undernourishment of workers and children is resulting from both parents working, and the general disorder of family life from many causes. Added to the strain of work in many cases is the strain of much time spent in traveling to and from work. All of the energy output should be carefully calculated to determine whether one is utilizing his energies in the best possible manner. In many ways our disorganized way of living today draws heavily upon our nervous energies. The adjustments we must make to a variety of new conditions, from being separated from our loved ones in service to learning a new skill and adapting to a new job, draw heavily on our energy reserves in imperceptible ways. Our children are also making adjustments to new neighbors among whom we move or who move among us. Workers of all kinds from farmers to teachers are confronted with difficult new conditions. Newly increased income itself brings new problems of budgeting. By some of us, foolish spending is indulged in even beyond the excessive incomes. Then follows a succession of worries about meeting obligations. Many people are learning that large incomes bring headaches as well as joys. The problems of any member of a family draw to some extent upon the energies of the others, but so are the new joys shared in a similar manner. And there are many compensating experiences in the present emergency. Some people are for the first time in their lives feeling useful in a great cause. For the first time in many years, they are getting out of debt. Many are now enjoying a more bounteous living than ever before. For some, this new sense of mastery is an invitation to dissipative living, which is usually most wasteful of one's energy reserves. Others are soberly conserving themselves and their substance for living in the better world they believe will dawn tomorrow.\nFROM all we have said of the new conditions of today which draw heavily upon our nervous energies, what are some of the common immature adjustments adults are liable to make? We may resort to the device of projecting our annoyances upon some convenient scapegoat. Usually an adult's loved ones in the home are the most convenient objects. Fatigued as a parent often is, he or she often fails to discern the true sources of his annoyances. But the family may not be especially receptive to the bad humor of any of its members, considering their own special annoyances these days. It is childish, needless to say, for an adult to victimize others when he is annoyed or tired. Another immature reaction is for parents to refuse to safeguard their own health and welfare. Fathers and mothers, like their children, often refuse to be governed by ordinary good judgment about proper nourishment, rest, and change.\n\nHOW GROWNUP ARE YOU?\nBlaming the government for causing shortages and confusion by mismanagement is a third kind of reaction. Aside from the question of the validity of these complaints, the question is whether this is a mature and sensible reaction. One's congressman might be able to help out if requested; but our neighbor usually does nothing but become infected with our complaints, which he takes up only because they nurse his annoyances. Evasions and \"chiseling\" are a fourth kind of immature reaction, often associated with grumbling about the government. The task of regulating the flow of materials to civilians is extremely complicated and has been done in great haste to meet emergencies. Many loopholes can be found by those who look for them. Many people do not realize that this is their war, and the successful management of the materials to win it depends upon the individual patriotism of every Americannot just \"the other fellow.\" Rationing regulations depend for their success on our ability to police ourselves. Grownup Americans comply even when they know \"no one is looking.\" Unfortunately, the people who conform conscientiously to regulations are often penalized for the evasions of others. The \"chiselers\" are likely to fail to see that their noncompliance to regulations is a cause of great waste of energy through the irritation and resentment aroused in the conscientious. Our opponents count on our being spoiled children when it comes to giving up our liberty to do as we please about these things. A fifth immature reaction to which\n109\nwe may fall victim has to do with our race prejudices. Perhaps there is no reaction more difficult to make in a sensible manner than that toward enemy nationals. Much vital energy is wasted in hating enemy nationals in a way that can accomplish no good purpose. Who, then, is the mature American? In our character sketch, we would say that he is the person who 1. Has a sense of humor which overrides shortages and annoyances and who experiences a deep patriotic emotion in helping win the war through a host of \"little things.\" 2. He works hard for victory at the tasks he can do best; but he doesn't have to be scolded about taking proper nourishment, rest, recreation. 3. He puts his surplus funds into government bonds, rather than wasting them on foolish spending, finally arriving at the short end of installment buying. 4. He has a sense of relative values between overtime and high pay and the welfare of his family his health, and his ultimate productiveness to the war effort. 5. He does not spread resentment to others through complaining about government regulations. He advises his congressman of his well considered criticism. 6. He doesn't take advantage of loopholes in government regulations. He is his own policeman. 7. He believes in the ultimate triumph of democratic ideals and indulges in no hysterical national hatreds which may make national enemies of enemy nationals among us; but he has intelligent patriotism which harnesses hatred and deals death blows where they can defeat the enemy."

            "content": "Amy Brown Lyman Honored Counselor Marcia K. Howells\nNEW and distinct honor has been accorded our beloved president, Amy Brown Lyman. She was selected January 26, 1943, by the Salt Lake City Council of Women to fill a'niche in its Hall of Fame. Only three times in the past ten years has this. Distinguished group chosen a few of their number \"whom they delight to honor.\" They have selected women from the leaders of the community because of outstanding devotion to public welfare and civic betterment. At this time when women are contributing so much to preserve cur way of life and safeguard our homes and country, recognition for achievement is very important. Interesting is the fact that the Salt Lake City Council should honor Amy Brown Lyman at this time, when she is general president of Relief Society, an organization with a century of rich experience as a background and characterized by devoted service to humanity. As president of Relief Society, Sister Lyman is giving inspirational guidance to 115,000 women. In addition to her Church activity, President Lyman is recognized as an authority on social welfare work, She is listed in Who's Who in America, American Women, Women of the West, and Principal Women of America. Standards by which women are selected by the Salt Lake City Council of Women for its Hall of Fame are: outstanding and unselfish service to the community during a great part of life; notable civic service and Page 110 AMY BROWN LYMAN social betterment; and outstanding personality. Before the seven women were chosen, important facts were carefully considered, such as heritage and background, birth, education, civic and business affiliation, patriotic service, and inspirational activities. Six other living women were elected to the Hall of Fame this year, sharing this honor with our president. They are Dr. Maud May Babcock, for many years head of the speech department of the University of Utah; Judge Reva Beck Bosone, nationally recognized for her judicial work; Mrs. R. W. Fisher, Chaplain of the Salt Lake City Council of Women; Mrs. W. S. Core, a teacher of citizenship to the foreign-born; (Continued on page 120) Womans Sphere: Ramona W. Cannon THE United States is to be congratulated upon the character of her women military leaders. Oveta Culp Hobby, WAAC (Women's Army Auxiliary Corps) commander, has. Been a state parliamentarian, lawyer, newspaper executive, bank director, author, and political worker. She is the charming wife of a former governor of Texas, and mother of two children. Dr. Mildred McAfee, lieutenant commander of more than 10,000 WAVE'S (Navy's Women Appointed for Volunteer Emergency Service), was president of Wellesley College, and has been a beloved teacher, church worker, and dean of women. Mrs. Nancy Harkness Love, 28, commander of the WAFS (Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron), has practiced many types of flying, with 1200 hours to her credit. Possibly the 500 or 600 qualifying as WAFS will pilot army bombers into war zones. Lieutenant commander Dorothy Stratton of the SPARS (\"Semper paratus'\"\"Always Ready,' Women's Coast Guard Reserve), is also an exceptional woman. Julia Flikke, motherly 63-year-old widow, has directed nurses since she took 100 of them to France in World War I. First American woman to rank as colonel, she now commands 31,000 nurses, some of whom are serving in Iceland, Alaska, England, Australia, Africa, India and the Solomons. IDEAS of notable women on how to win the peace. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands: Nations must conquer their desire for revenge and aim at justice for all. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt: Women of many nations have earned the tight to representation at the peace table and should be preparing themselves for such responsibility. Dorothy Thompson: United States' genius for production should be directed toward the abolishment of slums, the creation of a network of high grade hospitals that would leave no community unprovided for, and other social betterment. Pearl Buck: We must truly cooperate with the Eastern races, but, in order to do so, we must study and understand them. Helen Keller: We are responsible for other lives, for gentleness, for culture and progress. We must give now of our love and our free spirit, not to nations or peoples, but \"just the vast humanity that is being poured out in blood and anguish.\" We must have equal rights and opportunities for all persons, and breathe the spirit of American democracy more invincibly than our enemies have spread their propaganda of tyranny and viciousness. Page 11 EDITORIAL cm Vol. 30 Our Freedom and Responsibilities IN this month of February 1943, when Americans in every walk of life are struggling valiantly to preserve and protect the American way of life, the birthday anniversaries of two great statesmen, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, serve to remind us of the heroic struggles of the past that have given us the freedoms and the opportunities which we so jealously defend today, and impress upon us anew our duties and responsibilities toward our Government. Prophets of old declared this continent a land of promisea land of promise because of the fertility of its soil, the extensiveness of its streams, the preciousness of its ores \"in which this land... Doth abound most plentifully\"; a land of promise because God through his prophets declared it so. The Prophet Lehi said: \"Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom He shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve Him according to the commandments which He hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them.\" The truly great statesmen whose ideals and labors have helped to establish the American way of life, which we so highly prize today, were righteous men, having in their hearts a love for humanity and a sincere desire for the welfare of their brothers. We have only to read the lives of such men as Washington, Lincoln, and others to see that their Page 112 hearts were filled with the desire to promote the freedom and well-being of their fellow men. The spirit of God actuates all men whose desires are righteous and who unselfishly work for the good of mankind. \"By means of this spirit, every man is enlightened... Each in accordance with his capacity to receive the light.\" Inspired by the Father, our early American statesmen gave us the Constitution whereby we enjoy the greatest freedom of any people on earth. The Prophet Joseph Smith referred to the Constitution of the United States as \"a glorious standard... Founded in the wisdom of God.\" The Lord has told us through revelations to the Prophet Joseph Smith that \"Governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that He holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them for the good and safety of Society.\" Early in the History of the Church the Prophet Joseph Smith declared one of the fundamental tenets of Mormonism to be: \"We believe in being subject to kings, rulers, presidents, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law.\" The true Latter-day Saint yields obedience to the law because of his firm belief in the eternal fact that a successful society can only be built upon voluntary obedience by all of February 1943 No. 2 EDITORIAL its members to the laws which govern it. The Savior unequivocally endorsed obedience to law when He said: \"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.\" George Washington in his Farewell Address said: \"I believe every citizen should support the Government when final action is taken, whether he approves of the action or not.\" Yet even while yielding obedience to unjust law, it is the duty of everyone to use every lawful means in his power to bring about those changes which will make the laws of the government under which he lives more nearly conform to righteous principles. Fortunate indeed are we who live in this land of freedom where freedom of speech is lawful; where we may openly seek changes which we believe are for the betterment of our nation. Yet always must we remember that great blessings bring great responsibilities, and we must be sensitive to the responsibility 113 which accompanies the blessings of free speech. Let us not mistake liberty for license. From the Articles of Faith we see that obedience to law is not enough; we must also honor and sustain the law. As we obey, honor, and sustain the laws of the land even in the smallest matters, so we become better prepared to live above man-made laws and become fit subjects of the One Righteous King. This is a day when Latter-day Saints would do well to search the Scriptures for the promises made by the Father to this great nation. It is a time when we would do well to familiarize ourselves with the struggles of the past and the contributions of great men who have advanced this nation as a land of liberty. It is a time when we should meditate upon what is required of each individual as a citizen in this land of promise. Picture Presented Jo General Board Elder George Albert Smith honored the General Board of Relief Society at its meeting on January 13, 1943, by personally presenting to the General Board a copy of a colored drawing, in size about fifteen by twenty-four inches, of Lucy Mack Smith, which he and Elder Preston Nibley had discovered recently while on a visit to Illinois.

TO THE FIELD Food Production and Processing Program Featured By Public Schools HE \"Production and Processing of Food for Farm Family Use,\" is the title of the course in the Rural War Production Training Program which is now under way in 10,000 rural high schools of America. The program is sponsored by the United States Office of Education in cooperation with State Boards for Vocational Education and rural high schools. Persons over seventeen years of age are eligible to enroll in the courses which are offered free to the public. Competent instructors and leaders are employed to carry on the instruction and supervision of the program. Ten or more meetings constitute the formal instruction; and supervision and follow up by vocational teachers is a feature. The course on the production and processing of food is aimed at helping the heads of farm families to plan the family food budget and produce, Anniversary MARCH 17, 1943, Relief Society will be 101 years of age. Anniversary day this year, as always, will be recognized by the local Societies throughout the Church. The General Board is issuing no special suggestions for programs for this day, leaving entirely with the local Societies the planning of appropriate observances.; However, the General Board still has on hand some of the mimeographed material which was listed in Page 114 process, and conserve the necessary food to meet their needs. Skills, abilities, and information incident to the growing of the Victory Garden, home poultry flock, home milk supply, canning and caring of meat, preserving fruit and vegetables will. Be featured in the course. Every farm family can perform a fine patriotic service to our country and the whole cause of freedom by producing and preserving the food it needs from the resources on the home farm. The primary purpose of the course is to help American citizens to do this, so that food produced in commercial quantities can be shipped to our armed forces and our Allies. All persons interested in the course are urged to contact their local high school principal, vocational agricultural or homemaking teacher. Day Program bulletin No. 21, issued November 12, 1941, suitable for a commemorative Relief Society program either on or near March 17, or for the Sunday evening meeting on March 7. This may be had upon request as long as the supply lasts. It is suggested also that the recently issued A Centenary of Relief Society contains valuable historical material which migh be helpful in planning anniversary programs. Suggestions for the Relief Society NOTES TO THE FIELD meeting which is scheduled for the evening of Fast Day, March 7, 1943, have been prepared by the General Board. These suggestions appear in the January issue of theNew Serial THE problems and experiences of two people with different backgrounds who marry and live on a desert are graphically portrayed in a new serial, \"Tomorrow's Cup,\" by Anna Prince Redd, which will begin in the March issue of the Magazine. 'The struggles and heartaches as well as the joys of the young heroine, are absorbingly revealed as the plot unfolds to its final solution. You will want to read every installment of this serial which has as its background the fabled San Juan country. Mrs. Redd, who has spent many years in this part of Utah, first as a teacher and later as a wife, is well qualified to picture for the reader the beauty and vastness of the region. 'This is the first time Mrs. Redd has been represented in the Magazine in the field of fiction although her poems, articles of prose and a one-act play are already familiar to our readers. Acknowledgment HE General Board wishes to acknowledge the beautiful and colorful Christmas and New Year greeting cards which were received from many of the stakes and missions of the Church. These expressions of remembrance and good will are greatly appreciated and tend to form a bond of friendship and sisterly love at this most joyful season of the year. HUMAN EQUATION Bertha A. Kleinman The schools of the ages have lavished their culture, To fashion my temperament under control, Yet ever, anon, like the claw of a vulture, Some renegade impulse enrages my soul. I rise to the thrill of the great and the glorious, The skies for my highway, I \"hitch to a star.\" By nightfall my envy and greed are victorious, And pitifully human my dream bubbles are. I love and am loved with a depth of devotion, I sing and am glad at the glory of life; And here I am shaken with spiteful emotion, And spoiled is my day with its tempest and strife. I rise at the spur of demand and occasion, I plunge at defeat, at temptation, I fall; My triumph, my failure are human equation My task to exalt the composite of all! Planned Spring Cleaning Gertrude R. Garff Member of Relief Society General Board OU American women have a tremendous job to do. A home kept clean, tidy, harmonious, and beautiful... Good meals served graciously... A wife and mother who can take her work in her stride and come up glowing and unruffled to enjoy and be enjoyed by her family at the end of the daythese things are growing daily more vital to a sane indomitable America in a tense world.\" So says Dr. Louis E. Bisch, psychiatrist. True as is the above statement, it's asking a great deal of us women with spring cleaning practically upon us, especially this year with help so scarce we will have to do much of the work ourselves. Yes, it is asking a great deal, but the resourcefulness of womankind has never been denied, and with a little careful planning this problem can be solved successfully. Are you one of those housewives who favors a grand upheaval, ripping the house apart from top to bottom, wearing herself to shreds, and the family also, before everything is clean and in its place again? If you are, why not \"plan\" your seasonal cleaning this year so that the family will realize the cleaning has been completed not by the wear and tear on their dispositions, but by the shining beauty of their surroundings? I can almost hear many of you saying skeptically, \"Interesting, if true.\" Let me say that it can be true, and to prove it I'll give you my plan, which may be easily adapted to large or small houses and households. Page 116 I won't take space to tell you how to clean lampshades or do minor repair jobs, etc., because you may find all these directions in America's Housekeeping Book, the textbook for the Home Topic lessons of 1942- 43. This book answers almost anything one needs to know in connection with housekeeping. I start housecleaning late in February or early in March, depending upon the weather, and devote one or two days a week to cleaning until Ihave finished. First I tour the house with a note book in my hand, and note down a list of the needed repair jobs. This year, of course, there won't be any grand scale painting, etc., for obvious reasons, but there will be plenty of little things that always need fixing, such as a loose doorknob or a drawer that sticks. When I have completed my list, I then see that all these repairs are attended to before I start in on the real housecleaning. This is also the time I make new curtains or covers, etc. It's such a wonderful feeling to have them ready to use when the right times comes. MY first plunge takes me to the attic and basement. These floors need a regular cleaning and overhauling, especially now in wartime when so many of the useless articles that have accumulated over a period of years may be vitally needed and given away to swell the rubber, brass, or copper piles. I also start a pile consisting of clothing and household articles not needed in the war effort, to give to the Deseret Industries, PLANNED SPRING CLEANING adding to this pile as my housecleaning progresses. When I was in the mission field the rule was laid down that my companion and I should change our residence every three months. We decided that the real reason was not to make contacts with more people as much as to get rid of unnecessary articles. Today, my spring cleaning serves the same purpose to me as a move, and is much more easily accomplished. After the attic and basement are attended to (and my husband usually helps with the hard cleaning there), I turn my attention to the kitchen, back hall and bath. At this point I can't resist mentioning how I wash walls and painted surfaces. All my walls except two bedrooms happen to be covered with walltex of a slightly rough texture. First I wash these walls with a mild solution of tri-sodium-sulphate, and then rinse them with a solution of diluted cooked starch. You will be surprised how easily the soil will come off at the next claning time since the dirt will all be on the starch. In my kitchen I first clean the cupboards and dishes, then the ceiling and walls and finally the floors. The house doesn't seem half so dirty with these rooms fresh and clean. The next job I undertake is cleaning and straightening all dresser drawers, the rest of the cupboards, and closets. Everything is taken out and drawers, walls, and shelves are washed thoroughly. I also use a good spray if there is danger from moths. Fresh paper is placed in the drawers and I begin to restore order. This is the time I add to the material for the Deseret Industries, discarding 117 those articles I can't use or make over for the children. Out-of-season clothes are hung away in moth proof bags, and place is made for articles to be needed in the near future. I then clean the two wall papered bedrooms, first washing the curtains so they can be ironed and hung when all else is done. The walls and ccilings are cleaned with a dough-like preparation, with a thorough brushing afterward to remove crumbs that may cling to walls and baseboards. After I have washed the woodwork and windows, I then do the floors, scrubbing the one bedroom rug or sending it out to be cleaned, and cleaning and waxing the wooden  floor of the other bedroom. Since the children's bedroom has washable walls I clean them when I do the front hall, the procedure being much the same as for the kitchen and bath. The final windup brings me to the living and dining rooms. Draperies are cleaned so they will be ready to hang when all other cleaning in these rooms is completed. I make good use of the vacuum appliances on upholstered furniture, etc. After the walls, windows, and woodwork have been washed, and the carpeted floor vacuumed (or cleaned if the carpet needs cleaning), and furniture polished, I hang the draperies, replace pictures, lamps and bric-a-brac. By cleaning according to this plan doing a little each week and starting eafly in the seasonyour housecleaning may be accomplished without exerting much more effort than would be expended on your regular cleaning days. Yes, it is wonderful what a little planning will do to make your housecleaning easy! Flag Etiquette Due to many questions on proper flag etiquette which have arisen as the result of the entrance of the United States into World War II, the following information is presented to the readers of TheIt is reprinted by courtesy of The National Americanism Commission, The American Legion, Indianapolis, Indiana, from its bulletin, \"Let's Be Right on Flag Etiquette.\" Is it proper to fly the Flag of the A. No; it is not necessary to salute United States of America outdoors all night long now that the reproductions or photographs of the Flag. United States is engaged in war? Q. Is it necessary for a person to Flag should be displayed outdoors A. If the National Anthem is sung only from sunrise until sunset. The only cases where the. Flag properly flies at night are: 1Two Flags over the Capitol Building in Washington; one over the east front and one over the west front, day and night throughout the year. 2Over a permanent fort or ship when engaged in battle.. Is it necessary for a person to stand and salutewhenareproduction of the Flag of the United States of America is flashed on a motion picture screen? Page 118 by the entire audience, those persons present should: stand, but not salute. If the National Anthem is sung by a soloist accompanied by a band, orchestra or other musical instruments and the Flag is displayed, the audience should stand at attention and salute; those present in uniform using the right hand military salute and those in civilian dress, thecivilian salute (placing the right hand over the heart). When the National Anthem. No. The rules of civilian flag etiquette still govern, and the stand and salute when the National Anthem is sung? FLAG ETIQUETTE is played and/or sung by a soloist and the Flag is not displayed, those in uniform salute and those in civilian dress merely stand and face the music, men removing the headdress. Q. What should persons do when they are walking along the street and \"The Star Spangled Banner\" ls heard? A. If the music is near, you should stop, stand at attention and uncover. Q. Is it necessary for a person to stand and salute when the National Anthem is played over a loud speaker arrangement, film tract, radio, \"juke box\" or other type of a musical reproduction machine in a theater, restaurant, or other public place? A. No. It is recommended that persons pay respect only when the National Anthem is played by a band, orchestra or other musical instrument actually in the room. However, Colonel James A. Moss (deceased), who was head of the United States Flag Association and who was recognized throughout the nation as an authority on flag etiquette, has several answers to the question of what one should do when \"The Star Spangled Banner\" is heard over the radio. He says, \"It depends on circumstances. Generally speaking if it seems natural and not forced to stand and uncover, it should be done; otherwise, it should not. For example,' if eating at table, lying in bed, or working in the kitchen, standing at attention would be forced and unnatural.\" The office of the National 119 Americanism Commission  believes that when the National Anthem is played over a radio or in a restaurant from a \"juke box\" or some other type of musical reproduction machine, or in a theater over a film tract, here again it would seem more or less forced and unnatural to pay respect. Is it proper to stand when \"America, \"\"God Bless America,\" \"The Red, White and Blue\" and other such patriotic songs are played?. No; it is not proper. Has a change been made in the position of the right arm and hand while pledging allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America? Or A. No; there has been no change. The procedure set forth in the Flag Code is still recommended and that procedure is as follows: PLEDGE TO THE FLAG In pledging allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, the approved practice in schools, which is suitable also for civilian adults, is as follows: Standing with the right hand over the heart, all repeat together the following pledge: \"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" At the words \"to the Flag,\" the right hand is extended, palm upward, toward the Flag, and this position is held until the end, when the hand, after the words, \"Justice for all,\" drops to the side. However, civilian adults will always show full respect to the Flag, when the pledge is being given, by merely standing at attention, men removing the headdress. Persons in uniform should render the right hand salute. Q. Can the Flag be washed or drycleaned? A. Yes; it is permissible to wash or dry-clean the Flag. Q. In displaying the Flag flat, either horizontally or vertically, in the window of a home or place of business, or flat against the wall, what should be the position of the Flag? A. It should be displayed with the union (blue field with stars) to the left of the observer in the Street. Q. In what position should the Flag be when suspended vertically over the middle of the street? A. In a north and south street the union (field of blue) should be to the east, and in an east and west street, it should be to the north.

Graham, devoted to the interests of children; and Mrs. Lula Greene Richards, 94 years of age in April of this year, the first editor of the Women's Exponent, the forerunner of The Relief Society te Magazine.

Divine inspiration may be regarded as a lower or less directly intensive operation of spiritual influence upon man than is shown in revelation.\nCommunication From God To Man\nIt is a privilege of the Holy Priesthood to commune with the heavens, and to learn the immediate will of the Lord; this communion may be effected through the medium of dreams and visions, by Urim and Thummim, through the visitation of angels, or by higher endowment of face to face communication with the Lord.\nRevelation In Ancient Times\nThe patriarchs and prophets from Adam on down, including Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, through the Judges to David and Solomon, thence to John who was the forerunner of the Messiah, were blessed with the gift of revelation in varying degrees.\nChrist Himself Was a Revelator\nNotwithstanding His personal authority, God though He had been and was, while Jesus Christ lived as a man among men He declared His work to be that of One greater than Himself, by whom He had been sent and from whom He received instructions.\nPage 129\nThe Apostles Likewise Revelators\nThe Apostles, left to bear the burden of the Church after the departure of the Master, looked to heaven for guidance, expected and received the word of revelation to direct them in their exalted ministry.\nCurrent Revelation Necessary\nRevelation from God to man has been a vital characteristic of the living Church and is essential to the Church.\nAlleged Objections in Scripture\nAttempts to refute the doctrine of continued revelation by quoting certain passages of scripture are pitiably futile; they carry their own refutation, and leave untouched the truth that belief in current revelation is wholly reasonable and strictly scriptural.\nLatter-day Revelation\nThe scriptures, far from asserting a cessation of revelation in latter times, expressly declare the restoration and latter-day operation of that gift.\nRevelation Yet Future\nThe canon of scripture is still open; many lines, many precepts, are yet to be added; revelation, surpassing in importance and glorious fullness any that has been recorded, is yet to be given to the Church and declared to the world.\nLESSON PLAN\nLesson Aim: To show that the Lord has spoken, is speaking, and yet shall speak for the direction and guidance of His children.\nSuggested Material Outline\nI. Distinction between inspiration and revelation \"... I would place first and foremost the duty of seeking unto the Lord our God until we open the path of communication from heaven to earthfrom God to our own souls. Keep every avenue of your hearts clear and pure before Him.\" (Discourses of Brigham Young, p. 63) A. Inspiration\n1. The Spirit enlightens every one in the world\n2. The Holy Ghost is given to those who are baptized into the Church of Christ\n3. Light and truth may come to those who seek its guidance B. Revelation\n4. For personal benefit\n5. For benefit of Church\n6. How it may be given (See Articles of Faith Chapter 16, \"Communication from God to Man.\")\nII. The Latter-day Saint view of revelation logical \"The Bible is a record of a people's religious experience.\nThrough its entire history, spanning a score of centuries, revelation of God's will to man through His servants was the vitalizing element of that religion. In fact, the revelation of God's will, or the discovery by the prophets of God's will is the central theme of the record. The Christian world accepts that as a matter of course. Is a continuation of that vitalizing element in religion unreasonable? Joseph Smith's announcement of communion with God in the Sacred Grove, and elsewhere, is entirely in harmony with hundreds of similar experiences recorded in the accepted Christian Bible.\" (See also Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 57-58.) A. Doctrine of continued revelation is reasonable B. Doctrine of continued revelation is scriptural\n131\n(See II Nephi 28:29-30; and 29:6-12; and Doctrine and Covenants 11:25.)\nIII. Revelation essential to existence of the true Church A. New circumstances demand new enlightenment B. Insures an authorized ministry in the Church C. Provides guidance to Church officers in their Church administrations\nIV. What the doctrine of continued revelation to the Church means to you individually A. Ability of the Church to meet changing conditions B. Instills faith to meet trials C. Belief in God's omnipotence\nSuggested Method Outline\nTwo class members might be assigned in advance to treat the two topics in the outline, \"Inspiration\" and \"Revelation.\" The quotation from Brigham Young's Discourses might be used as an opening point of contact at the beginning of the lesson. Following are statements which might be discussed during the presentation of the lesson: 1. Show that inspiration does not deprive man of his freedom or individuality. 2. Cite the principal objections, professedly founded on scripture, to the doctrine of continued revelation. 3. What is known of God's revelations to Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses? The last topic of the outline makes a splendid opening for the bearing of testimonies by the women.\nReferences Talmage, James E., Sunday Night Talks, pp. 308-318.

It is to love others as ourselves. If this high ideal were practiced, it would establish the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. Our neighbors, in the broadest sense, include all mankind. We are all the children of our Heavenly Father, and He loves each one of us. The spirit of the good neighbor leads all those who possess it not only to desire the same good for all others that they wish for themselves, but to strive to make that good a reality. The Apostle Paul gives us the characteristics of this spirit of love. They are patience, forbearance, longsuffering, kindness, generosity, courtesy, humility, unselfishness, good temper, thinking well of others, and love of truth. In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord said: And now, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do goodyea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit. (Doctrine and Covenants 11:12) And He further states that,... I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy; Speaking to the Relief Society, on March 28, 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith said:... Let your hearts expand, let them be enlarged towards others; you must be long-suffering, and bear with the faults and errors of mankind. The spirit of the good neighbor is a practical ideal. There are numberless daily occasions where its teachings can be applied. There are always with us those who need real kindness. There are plenty of opportunities for generosity, unselfishness, good temper, and courtesy. This spirit can extend beyond personal relationships to the community. We can strive to obtain for every child, for example, what we wish for our own. Our public school system is an expression of this spirit. Every child should have educational opportunities, health opportunities, a normal home, and those things which make for its greatest physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development. As Mary E. Richmond once said, We should not only care for the unfortunate one who was robbed and beaten on the road from Jericho to Jerusalem, but we should clear the road of thieves and robbers and make of it a safe place for women and children to travel. To do good to all men, whoever they may be, is one of the funda-\nmental principles of the Gospel, and is the real spirit of the good neighbor.\nDiscussion\n1. Relate the incidents leading to the parable of the Good Samaritan; also relate the parable.\n133\n2. Whom do you think Jesus meant by the word \"neighbor\" in His reply to the question of the lawyer?\n3. Who is in greater need of neighborly love, the good or the wrongdoer?\n4. What are some of the qualities of charity, or love, as expressed in First Corinthians, Chapter 13?"

With some commodities already rationed and many more in the offing, housewives, according to Government plans, will not only need to juggle their budgets but also their coupons for obtaining such commodities. However, the Government is rationing food not to make meal planning more difficult, but to make sure each oneservice man and woman, ally and civilian gets his share of the particular foods he needs. In order that each may have his proportion, sharing and careful planning, with the help of substitutes for the \"must haves,\" are necessary. The word \"substitutes\" should be used advisedly, especially in reference to foods, particularly protein foods. Perhaps \"alternate main dish\" or \"in place of\" are more accurate expressions. The housewife needs to know, especially when using foods interchangeably, that all protein foods are not of the same value. Meat and other animal proteins contain the important amino acids or building stones needed to insure good quality, while the vegetable proteins are not complete alone but need to be used with protective foods to be well balanced. Besides protein of good quality, meat supplies thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, iron and flavor. Fish, poultry, milk, cheese, eggs, dried peas and beans, soybeans, nuts, variety and glandular meats, can be used in many combinations as the main dish. Meat need not be entirely substituted, but extended by the use of other food, such as rice, noodles, dumplings, potatoes and other vegetables. Leftovers can be used in stews, croquettes, hash, souffls, or in sauce served on waffles or biscuits. Casserole dishes are convenient to use in extending the flavor of meat, fish, or vegetables. Meat goes further when cooked at a moderately low, even temperature. While soybeans have been used as food, though not extensively, they are now frequently used in combination with other foods. The meat industry is experimenting with a meat and soy sausage which will stretch the supply of sausage meat. Millers are working on combinations of white and soy flour, testing them in breakfast cereals. Soybeans are used to furnish oil in soap and paint and to make plastics. Now they furnish a possible source for a new fibre that is warm and feels like wool. The rationing of sugar so far has not been a real hardship, and there are substitutes that can take the place of sugar without lessening the food value; however, the recipes calling for sugar must be adjusted when substitutes are used. A Government bulletin says that when syrups and maple products are substituted for sugar, their differences must be kept in mind. Sorghum, molasses, and cane syrup are less sweet than maple sugar, honey, or sugar itself, and one and one-half times as much of them is required to obtain the same degree of sweetness. Corn syrup is even less sweet and twice as much corn syrup as sugar is required to obtain an equal degree of sweetness. In addition, it must be remembered that syrups add water as well as their own characteristic flavor to the food. Honey or corn syrup may be substituted for one-half the sugar in putting up fruit without affecting the delicate flavor of the fruit. Honey, when available, may replace one-half the sugar in jellies, jams, preserves, or marmalades. Corn syrup may replace one-half the sugar in preserves, but only one-quarter in jellies and jams. Slightly longer cooking is required to get the same consistency as when sugar is used alone. For baking, some substitutions that have been worked out are: For 1 cup granulated sugar use: molasses1 cup with  ts. Soda; reduce liquid requirements of recipe  to ? amount. Honey1 cup with  ts. Soda; reduce liquid requirements of recipe  to ? amount. Maple, maple-cane, or corn syrup1 cup and  cup sugar; reduce the liquid same as above. Brown or maple sugar1 cup firmly packed. These amounts will vary a little according to the density of the materials. The flavor and color of the finished product will also vary according to whether light or dark ingredients are used. Foods containing honey have a tendency to brown more quickly than do those containing other sweetenings, so the temperature for baking may be slightly reduced. A combination of molasses or honey with sugar (half and half) produces results most nearly like that obtained from the use of all sugar. After the sugar has been taken from the sugar cane, chemists are using the residue of the sugar cane to make a substitute for the wax used in floor waxes and varnishes. Many other useful materials and substitutes are being made through means of chemistry. When nylon is again available for civilian use, there will no doubt be many new developments, and nylon will be blended with other fibres to make substitutes for many fabrics now in use. If, and when, liquid milk is rationed, tomato and fruit juices may be used in the place of milk to make biscuits, cake, gingerbread, and cook-\nies. Vegetable juices heated slowly, served in cups with a slice of lemon or other tart fruit can be used occasionally in place of cocoa, or made into sauces to serve with spaghetti or noodles. Averaged figures show that butter contains two and one-half times as much Vitamin A as does fortified margarine, often used as a butter substitute, but that margarine costs half as much. Every homemaker, however, is eager to get good quality nourishment as well as quantity for the money spent. While we are all concerned with substitutes for many of the foods we have been in the habit of using, our vital concern is to find substitutes that will maintain health and good nutrition. Many such substitute foods are available. New sources of cloth for clothes may be milk, peanuts, fish, protein, glass and bark of trees. Milkweed, a nuisance plant in some places, is going to work for the navy, and the floss will be used as a substitute for kapok in life preservers and rubber boats. If it proves substantial, it may be used in place of wool. Surveys show that clay, one of the oldest raw materials, is plentiful; hence, many products such as sewer pipe, dinner ware, pottery, hospital supplies and earthenware cooking utensils, are being made of clay for civilian and military needs. Plywood is being used for springs in upholstered chairs. Reports say that where plywood is used furniture is not as plump as the conventional overstuffed kind, but it is quite comfortable and good looking. Civilian products using steel, copper, or aluminum are due for further drastic cuts\n135\nin production, and unless the makers of less essential commodities can substitute such materials as wood-fibre or glass for essential metals, the Government will no doubt entirely stop the production of such commodities. Many household articles made of wood, glass, or plastic, such as cooking utensils, salad bowls, lamps, etc., are now on the market. As yet there seems to be no substitute for metal wire used in egg-beaters, strainers, sieves, etc., so the housewife should take good care of these utensils to make them last for the duration. The few canned foods and other products that are released to civilians in the future will have a different dress. Containers will be of electrolytic tinplate which is not tin at all, but a specially prepared steel plate. Then specially baked enamels will be used to protect the food against discoloration, and to safeguard against rusting of the can. Many dried foods and other articles will come in paper and pasteboard cartons. Buttons regarded as brass and pearl are not what they seem, but are made of zinc with brass and enamel coating and of inexpensive plastic. The latter versatile material allows for many bright colors which are very decorative. Whatever changes may come, the American woman can and will meet them. Rationing and substitutes may be a nuisance, but will no doubt have a salutary effect on many household budgets. Out of all this may emerge a nation of intelligent consumersconsumers who will have learned, through necessity, to live within their incomes.\nReferences Pamphlet \"RationingWhy and How,\" Consumer Division, Office of Price Administration, Washington, D.

Personalities of the Bible continuedMary of Nazareth\n2. The theme of the Bible as a whole\n3. A few specific Bible themes\n4. The influence of the Bible upon our daily lives\nMary of Nazareth\nThe last lesson considered Eve, the first woman, the mother of mankind. We shall now turn to Mary, the mother of Jesus, the greatest of all mankind. Mary knew the heights of joy and the depths of sorrow. She was of the royal tribe of Judah, but was reared as a humble Nazarene maiden, becoming betrothed to a carpenter, Joseph. We can scarcely imagine her astonishment when the Angel Gabriel appeared to her and said: \"Hail,... Blessed art thou among women,\" and told her of her mission. After she had comprehended the meaning of his words, she visited Elizabeth and uttered her joy in a triumphal song, similar to the one Hannah sang when she blessed the Lord for the gift of her son Samuel. After Mary's return from her three months' visit with her cousin, Elizabeth, Joseph's nobility of character is shown in the fact that he, \"... Not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.\" But the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and informed him that Mary's condition was a cause of honor and rejoicing, not of shame and mourning, because she was to bear the Son of God. In the Book of Mormon, Nephi 11:13-21, Nephi saw in vision the Virgin and the Son of God and when he was asked by an angel what he\nsaw, he replied: \"A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.\" Some of the incidents in the life of Jesus must have had a remarkable effect upon his mother. For instance, there was the time when she and Joseph brought Jesus, a baby, to the temple at Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord. The faithful Simeon, waiting for the fulfillment of the promise that he would see the Christ before he died, took Him up in his arms. He acknowledged that this promise had now been made good. This must have been a proud and happy moment for the young mother. But, as said before, she tasted deepest sorrow, too. Even Simeon foresaw suffering for Jesus and for Mary. He told her, \"Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also;\" Indeed, her soul must have been pierced many times during the years that followed. There was the time, while He was still a lad, when she thought He was lost and found Him in the temple talking with the wise men. Great as her relief must have been when she found Him unharmed, it was not unmixed joy, for she was made to realize even at that early time that their lives would be separated by His divine mission. His words: \"Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?\" brought home to her the fact that she was His mother, but that He was the Son of God. When He began preaching a strange doctrine and performing miracles and some people began to hate Him and say false things about Him, Mary suffered. But when the\n137\nmultitudes followed Him from place to place to hear Him speak and to be healed of their infirmities, she rejoiced in His power. Then came His crucifixion. The Apostle John, who himself witnessed the tragic event from a point near the cross, records the pathetic incident. She stood nearby, her mother-heart breaking at the agony Jesus was enduring. It must have been a comfort to her in the days that followed to know that in that dreadful hour her Son's sympathy went out to her. It would seem that He knew her need of a son to support her in this dark trial and He gave to her His friend John. He said, \"Woman, behold thy son!\" and to John, \"Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.\" Mr. Done points out that there is something pathetic and beautiful in this incident. Jesus, whose work had made Him almost an exile from home for years, recognized the purity and strength of mother love and hallowed it by making it the last tie that bound him to earth. Having made provision for His mother with one who should be a tender guardian, He had no further duty to perform. Mr. Done says, \"Surely no higher recognition of the sacred tie of motherhoodthe acme of the development of true womanhoodcan be thought of than this.\" \"Mary revealed her faith and humility in her immediate surrender of herself to the divine will though she knew not how it was to be accomplished; she revealed her energy and earnestness in her journey to Hebron; her happy thankfulness in her song of joy; her loyalty and trust in keeping her Son's words in her heart, though she could not fully understand them. So far as Mary is portrayed in the Scriptures she is all we should have expected, the most tender, the most faithful, humble, patient, and loving of women, but a woman still.\" This concluding lesson of the introductory course in Bible literature will consider some of the themes in the great book.\nThe Theme of the Bible as a Whole\nSuch questions as these, humanity has continued to ask since the beginning of time: What is the meaning of the world? Is God my Father? Can I trust Him? What are my relations to my fellow men? Who was Christ and what is His mission? Answers to these questions form the great themes which merge into the all-inclusive theme of the Biblethe study of man and his struggle toward salvation. As Clayton S. Cooper says in his book, The Bible and Modern Life, \"The Bible spreads out before us God's plan for human existence.\" For this reason, in all times men have come to the Scriptures to find the visions of life and its plan where, as Matthew Arnold says: The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain, And what we say we mean, and what we would, we know. A man becomes aware of his life's flow, And hears its winding murmur. The theme is righteousness, for the Bible strikes down injustice and wrong wherever these are found. \"It is the book of right, of integrity, of sincerity, and reality.\" It is God's revelation of Himself to His childrena revelation which Lyman Abbott declares to be \"unparalleled for its strength and beauty by any other of the world's great literatures.\"\nSome Specific Bible Themes\nThis general theme, as indicated above, can be broken up into many themes such as human suffering as developed in the Book of Job; the inspiration and solace of nature, as portrayed in the Psalms; loyalty and obedience as shown in the story of Ruth; precepts for practical living as exemplified in the Proverbs. Though the stories of Ruth and Esther are so unlike in structure, setting, and character, they both have the same theme. Ruth is a peasant, Esther a queen; the story of Ruth is an idyl (a simple narrative story of country scenes and life), and that of Esther is a drama with all the dramatic motivation and suspense of a modern production; though the events in the stories occur eight hundred years apart, yet each story develops the theme of nobility of soul amid sore trials. Reverend James M. Whiton says of Ruth: \"The theme is common, yet one that we weary of no more than of the grass and flowers.\" Ruth shows filial piety, devotion, courage, self-respect. This story beautifies with the tenderest sympathy a relationship that is often fruitful of antipathythat between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. We see a blighted life made, through the struggle of devoted love, to bloom again. With the story of Esther we come into a larger world. But here we\nhave the same theme, the same dominant spiritthe \"high resolve, the steadfast constancy that 'Grasps the skirts of happy chance And breasts the blows of circumstance.'\" The reward for facing hard circumstances courageously is more alluring as presented here than in the earlier story, but is of the same kind. In the setting of the story of Esther we have \"regal splendor, despotic power, sensual passion, intriguing servility, murderous revenge.\" \"And here on this dark and stormy sea,\" says Reverend Whiton, \"is a young woman, gifted with beauty, discretion, courage, who masters these menacing elements and becomes the savior of her people.... This story of Esther is not only material for the noblest and gentlest meditation, but a token that in daily eventsthe unforeseen chancesof life, in the little unremembered acts, in the fall of a sparrow, in the earth bringing forth fruit of herself, God is surely present. The name of God is not there, but the work of God is.\" From many points of view the Book of Job is one of the greatest in the Bible. It is truly superb as literature which has been defined as \"those books wherein moral truth and human passion are touched with a certain largeness, sanity, and attraction of form.\" Dr. Genung says:... If we apply such a definition to the Book of Job, we will find that the book retains, in enhanced significance, all the good that other methods of approach have yielded, while it also gains beyond expression in its meaning for our common human nature. It becomes, as Carlyle has defined it, an \"all men's book\"; we recognize in it\n139\nthe pulsing soul of the wide world before that soul had shut itself up in prejudice or belief or narrowness of doctrine; and yet after it has been so \"salted by fire\" as to be deeply aware of the mystery of existence. The last three wordsthe \"mystery of existence\" is the theme of this great masterpiece. It is at that point alone that it can be touched in this lesson, although a course in Bible literature could not be complete without a full lesson or two on other literary aspects of this great work. In the presentation of the theme the author introduces highly dramatic elements. We see Job on his ash heap, in darkness and misery. He is groaning with disease. He is deserted and scorned by his friends. But he remains absolutely honest with himself and loyal to his friends. At times it seems that even God is against him, but he remains steadfast to his ideal as his faith battles its way up to victory in the survival of good and right beyond the tomb. \"Here is the great law of the spiritual life, that the true service of God is not work for reward; it is heart-loyalty, a hunger after God's presence, which survives loss and chastisement; which in spite of contradictory meaning cleaves to what is godlike, and reaches up out of the darkness and hardness of this life to light and love beyond.\" The debate on the question why the righteous suffer is \"only the wordy vehicle whereby the littleness of men, their false dignity, their hidebound traditions, their dogmatic intolerance, their vanity of knowledge beat against the great rock-soul of the patriarch as he wages his battle.\" This central theme is for all men in all times. In it is vitally involved the spiritual evolution of manhood. \"In this masterpiece the heart of the author of Job beats in unison with the heart of the world... Sending forth the cry of those who see through a glass darkly, blinding nothing of the terror and dread, yet in the face of it all, assuming that attitude which for life and character is the true solution of the world's enigma. Human race that from the depth of the inexplicable mystery one voice has learned to say, 'I know that my Redeemer liveth.' No greater utterance has ever illumined the pages of literature.\"\nApplication of Bible Themes to Our Own Lives\nIt is because these great Biblical themes strike the deepest chords of both the human and the divine in man that they are of such inestimable value in our daily lives. When we see how others have met such problems as Ruth, as Esther, as Joseph, as Moses, as Job, as Jesus Himself had to meet, we learn better how to meet our own. Every book in the Bible presents themes the application of which would strengthen our characters and enrich our lives. The books of the Apocrypha, as well as those of the Bible proper, offer these great themes. At the beginning of the Apocrypha, for instance, we come upon a noble passage, in the First Book of Esdras. It is a short story which answers the eternal question: What is the strongest thing in the world? The answer which won the prize is the same answer the majority of men would give today\"Truth is mighty above all things.\" So the Bible considered alone as literature is a light to guide us in our daily lives. The influence of the Bible upon the lives of men is suggested by the many tributes paid to it by men in different walks of life. A few of them follow: The King James revisers said in 1611: If we be ignorant, the Scriptures will instruct us; if out of the way, they will bring us home; if out of order, they will reform us; if in heaviness, comfort us; if dull, quicken us; if cold, inflame us. Lincoln wrote to a friend: I am profitably engaged in reading the Bible. Take all of this book upon reason that you can, and the balance on faith, and you will live and die a better man. Napoleon I declared that by reading the Bible \"not only is one's mind absorbed, it is controlled, and the soul can never go astray with this book for its guide.\" Ruskin advises: Read your Biblemake it your daily business to obey it in all that you understand. To my early knowledge of the Bible I owe the best part of my taste in literature. It is well for the whole\nLesson Helps\n1. Tell the story alluded to above in the First Book of Esdras, chapters 3 and 4.\n2. Choose other stories or sections of the Bible which develop themes of vital importance in our lives today.\n3. Find additional testimonies from great men of the past and present whose lives have been greatly influenced by the Bible.\n4. How has the Bible helped you?\n5. Give choice passages you have memorized.\nReferences Talmage, James E., Jesus the Christ, pp. 75-87"

They all will recall to the reader the tragedy, the joy, and the sorrow, toil, and religious fervor of the great events of our history. It is quite natural for us to reverence hallowed places where heroes have died for some great principle, or fought for some noble cause. Such places have an atmosphere of spiritual life. How many lives are monumented in the hearts of mourning mothers, widowed brides, and sorrowful friends. Instead of the full years of natural service from many of her children, our country counts but their poor memories, \"the tender grace of a day that is dead.\" Religious ideals are expressed in magnificent churches and tabernacles. For example, our Tabernacle in Salt Lake City gives us a great message. The very stones are sacred because the hands of our fathers touched them, and we can proudly say as we look at the old building, so majestic and beautiful:\nOUR Flag\nOh, say can you see by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, Thro' the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.\nThe flag of the United States was adopted by Act of the Continental Congress June 14, 1777, when it was resolved: That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation. Located on Arch Street in Philadelphia is the house where Betsy Ross made the first American flag \"See, this our fathers did for us.\" from a design prepared by a committee of Congress in consultation with General George Washington. Originally, the committee suggested the. Six-pointed star, but Mrs. Ross preferred the five-pointed star as more artistic and the committee accepted | it. Betsy Ross continued making flags for the Government for many years. In 1789, when General Washington became President of the United States, there were thirteen states in the Union. Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791 and Kentucky in 1792, consequently Congress passed a bill in 1794 increasing the number of stars and stripes to fifteen. It was not until 1817 that Congress decided to reduce the stripes to thirteen, and increase the number of stars, one for each incoming LESSON DEPARTMENT 141 state. The plan for arranging them in rows was adopted in 1819 and has been continued to the present. The flag with the thirteen stripes and a star added for every new state was completed July 4, 1912, with the admission of the State of Arizona. Charles Evans Hughes, the former Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has written a beautiful statement on \"What the Flag Means.\" He says: This flag means more than association and reward. It is the symbol of our national unity, our national endeavor, our national aspiration. It tells you of the struggle for independence, of union preserved, of liberty and union one and inseparable, of the sacrifices of brave men and women to whom the ideals and honor of this nation have been dearer than life. It means America first; it means an undivided allegiance... It means that you cannot be saved by the valor and devotion of your ancestors; that to each generation comes its patriotic duty; and that upon your willingness to sacrifice and endure as those before you have sacrificed and endured rests the national hope. It speaks of equal rights; of the inspiration of free institutions exemplified and vindicated; of liberty under law intelligently conceived and impartially administered. There is not a thread in it but scorns selfindulgence, weakness, and rapacity. It is eloquent of our common destiny. The Statue of Liberty Dear to the hearts of Americans is the Statue of Liberty standing on Bedloe Island in New York City harbor. The creator of this noble work was a French sculptor and artist, Frederic Auguste Bartholdi. In talking to a group of friends one day, Bartholdi said: We want our country and the United States to be friends forever, never to take up arms against each other. To cement our bond of friendship, we need a sign, a monument to say to people everywhere, \"The United States and France will always be friends.\" It was he who thought of the Statue of Liberty and who aroused the people of France to give the Statue to the United States, which was done on July 4, 1884. On the base of the Statue is an inscription written by Emma Lazarus, an American poet and essayist of the last part of the nineteenth century. She was a Jewess, and worked valiantly for the relief of Jewish refugees from Russia. She believed passionately in America as a home for the oppressed, which inspired her to write these lines: Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand; A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon hand, glows world-wide welcome. Independence Hall, Philadelphia In the old city of Philadelphia is Independence Square, tastefully laid out in flower-beds and lawns, with wide and well-shaded walks. On the north side of the Square, and fronting Chestnut Street, is the most hallowed building of American patriotic memories, Independence Hall. The Declaration of Independence was adopted here, July 4, 1776, and here the Constitution of the United States was drafted in 1787. In the central corridor is the sacred Liberty Bell. In the upper floor of the hall, Washington delivered his Farewell Address in closing his term of office as President. 'The large east room is where the Revolutionary Congress met, and the old furniture  LESSON DEPARTMENT remains as it was in those olden days. In the central corridor is the sacred Liberty Bell which bears these immortal words: Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you. (Leviticus 25:10) The bell was cast in America after a model that had been made in England, and was hung in the steeple of the State House in the summer of 1753, and was rung on all historic occasions until after the American Revolution. It was rung when the news of the battle of Lexington reached Philadelphia, and you have heard how the bell was rung by Andrew McNair when the Declaration of Independence was passed by the Second Continental Congress. When we were school children how happily we used to recite the words: That old State House bell is silent, Hushed now its clamorous tongue, But the spirit is awakened Still is livingever young; And when we greet the smiling sunlight On the fourth of each July, We will never forget the bellman, Who, twixt the earth and sky, Rang out loudly \"INDEPENDENCE!\" Which, please God, shall never die. Plymouth Rock Great in their goodness and wise beyond their generation, the Pilgrim Fathers, the founders of the first permanent white settlement in what is now Massachusetts, seem to have been divinely chosen as the men most fit to lay the foundations of a great commonwealth. By their courage, fortitude, and zeal, they won for themselves a home in the American wilderness, and through their political foresight and religious independence, passed on to their 143 countrymen, forall time, a sacred heritage of liberty in thought and deed, a heritage which has become the basis of American life. The little town of Plymouth nestles close to the seashore, and as you stand on Plymouth Rock, you turn and see the beautiful statue of Massasoit, the Indian of peace, created by our famous Utah-born sculptor, Cytus Dallin. Above on the hill is the National Monument to the Forefathers. You will read the inspired Mayflower Compact, which is fundamental to our Constitution. It was drawn up in the cabin of the Mayflower, a few days before the Pilgrims landed. You will never forget a day at Plymouth, for you will realize more than ever the sufferings of those people who came across the \"unknown waters\" to establish homes and freedom in America. The City of Washington Washington is a city of monuments and shrines. The Washington Monument rises into the sky five hundred and fifty-five feet. Nearby are the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, magnificent creations, which recall the words of the Psalmist: Lord who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle, Who shall rest upon thy Holy Hill? The Capitol is the crowning glory of Washington. The great dome surmounted by a colossal figure of Freedom can be seen for many miles. The city of Washington became the seat of our national government in 1800. The Capitol is surrounded by many noble buildings, including the Congressional Library and the Supreme Court Building, with its two front pediments bearing the inscriptions: Equal justice under the law. Justice the guardian of liberty. In the Congressional Library are many thousands of original manuscripts, including the original copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.* Down the beautiful Potomac river is Mount Vernon, a \"beloved place.\". There you may see the old home and rooms made sacred by the Washington family. A few rods to the south of the house is Washington's tomb, and above the portal are these words: I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me though he were dead, yet shall he live.  As we leave the city of Washington, we think of the, lines of John Ruskin, as found in his \"Lamb of Memory\": Therefore when we build, let us think that we build forever. Let it not be for present delight, nor for present use alone, let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for, and let us think... That men will say as they look upon the labor, \"See! This our fathers did for us.\" (1) Note: Due to the war, valuable historic documents have been removed. But we must cross the continent to our western land, where there are other shrines and monuments. In Portland, Oregon, is the beautiful monument of Sacajewea, the little Shoshone Indian girl who led Lewis and Clark across the continent by way of the Missouri and Columbia rivers1803-1806. Over rude paths beset-with hunger and tisk, she passed on toward the vision of a better country. To an assembly of men busy with the perishable rewards of the day, she brought the three-fold leaven of enduring societyfaith, gentleness, and home, with the nurture of children. If time permits, this lesson also presents an opportunity to class leaders for a discussion of our own Church shrines and monuments. Questions for Discussion 1. Why do people build monuments and shrines? 2. What are some of the monuments you have seen and admire? (It may be a building or a sacred spot that makes its appeal to you.) 3. Why do you think France presented to the United States the beautiful statue in New York City harbor? 4. Can you name three famous sculptors of Utah who have created beautiful monuments? 5. Who are some of the great American sculptors?

            "content": "shadows across the patch of lawn; the wide stretch of fields was still. Suddenly, from some unseen spot, came the clear call of a meadow lark. Gerald, Elsie's husband, was taking good care of the farm now that John was gone! The front door of the small house beyond the garden opened and John's sister Maggie appeared. She followed slowly the narrow path between the two homes and climbed the steps of the larger dwelling with jerky effort. \"Maggie is old,\" thought Sheila\"really old.\" Elsie came out, crisp and cool in her blue organdy. \"Gerald said the rehearsal went fine last night,\" she said with enthusiasm. \"He thinks the pageant's going to be great.\" \"Weel, they'll hae to do some fancy acting if they come up to Sheila'sand that a lang time ago,\" replied Maggie dryly. Sheila made a gesture of remonstrance, but she looked pleased. \"Young folks must have their day, Maggie. And don't you forget that Colleen is going to sing tonight.\" She squeezed her handbag tight against her breast, for it held Colleen's stirring little note: \"I must see you tomorrow, Grandma! I must! I have something important to tell you.\" Something important! Could it be an offer? Why, Colleen had had only a year of real training. Maggie was describing to patient Elsie the wonders of Sheila's performance in Hazel Kirk. \"There, there,\" cried Sheila with pretended petulance, \"let the past be!\" But Maggie was bubbling with reminiscences. \"Your Uncle John was over-proud of her, Elsie,\" she said ruefully. \"He was sae proud that I sulked. It's nae pleasant for a sister to be shoved aside by a weebit wife.\" The laugh that had risen in Maggie's throat broke off and ended in a sigh. Both old women thought of John sleeping beside his first wife, the gentle English girl who had not survived the rigors. After a pause Maggie's thin voice rose again. \"Your Uncle John was nae the mon to let a bit o' stubborn land get the best o' him, Elsie. He dug out rocks to build his house and brought water down from the mountain for his fields.\"\nBLANCHE KENDALL McKEY\n\"Uncle John was a thrifty man,\" corroborated Elsie. \"Aye,\" said Maggie, \"and masterful. He had Ireland in his household, but he meant to hold his ain.\" She screwed her wrinkled face until it gave a distorted impression of roguishness, cast a challenging glance at her sister-in-law, and waited for a sharp retort. But Sheila seemed to be unconscious of the prattle. Elsie noted her melancholy detachment with rising apprehension. Old people were so moody and hard to understand! When they should be gay they sank into the depths. \"Come, now, Aunt Sheila,\" she pleaded. \"Tomorrow's the Twenty-fourth! They're putting on this pageant for people like you. Think of all you've done for the town.\" Her eyes swept the stretches of corn, wheat and alfalfa, the tops of farmhouses in the valley, the paved road which led to the recreation hall where the pageant was to be given. \"No one has done more good than you have, Aunt Sheila.\" Sheila would have liked to talk to the sympathetic Elsie if she had thought the younger woman could understand. In her unhappy condemnation of what she had done with her talents she felt the need of love. That was why Maggie's praise had sounded so sweet. She would gladly have confessed that she felt herself to be a flat failure but for a deep-sunk timidity. Elsie was young and didn't know enough, whereas Maggie was old and knew too much. So she threw them both a Mona Lisa smile and hugged tight the thought of Colleen. Elsie plucked playfully at her aunt's sleeve and shook her bobbed head as though she were still a girl. \"No one can go on acting and singing forever,\" she tactlessly comforted. Sheila smiled again, her glance unlighted; then her lids fell as she caught the significance of Maggie's canny remark: \"She's not greetin' for the songs she can sing nae more; she's greetin' for the songs she niver hae sung.\" Good heavens! Was there nothing that the heart could hide? Such piercing seemed almost immodest. With an effort she lifted her gaze to find Maggie smiling at her fondly. After all Maggie loved her. She felt a painful little clutch at her\n89\nthroat. Then she let her great eyes rest illuminatingly on her sister-in-law's face, fell in with the family dialect and said amicably, \"Aye, lass.\" Elsie ran down the steps impatiently, looking up the road. \"Gerald should have been here with the car twenty minutes ago,\" she exclaimed. \"Something has held him upprops, I suppose. It will spoil the whole evening if we have to rush in at the last minute.\" HALF-HOUR later, seated comfortably in the front row of the balcony which afforded the best view of the stage and so had been reserved for honored guests, Sheila attempted to subdue her rising excitement. Was Colleen nearly ready? Would she have a moment to slip upstairs before the performance? Suddenly she heard a quick step coming down the aisle, and almost before she could turn she heard Colleen's whisper. \"Move over, Grandma. I only stay a second.\" Sheila shuffled. Into the seat reserved for the president of the Relief Society and Colleen slipped down beside her. \"Look, Grandma!\" 'Timidly she thrust out her hand on which shone the loveliest diamond the old lady  had ever seen. She lifted her eyes to study the girl's face. \"It had just come when I wrote the note yesterday. Bob and I are going to be married.\" \"Bob?\" wavered Sheila. \"Bob Brownell. Surely you tremember Bob.\" Sheila hadn't thought of Bob Brownell in a long time. With an effort she recalled an apple-cheeked bo \"He s been away to medical school, you know, for nearly four years.\" Colleen's voice trembled a little. She glanced at twotiny wings pinned over her heart. \"Bob and I saw a good deal of each other when I was at school last winter.\" Her hand pressed the small insignia. \"Now he's in the Air Corps.\" Can  SILENT STRINGS Sheila felt a throbbing in her own breast. Little Colleen's hero was offering his life for his country! In a moment the tremulous voice came again. \"['m not going back to the Conservatory in the fall, Grandma. I'm going to make bullets. II've got to help.\" Sheila saw the glisten of heavy tears and felt empty herself. She knew that Colleen wanted to speak further, but couldn't. \"Tt's all right, dearest,\" she whispered close to the wet cheek. \"T could never have gone to the Conservatory at all if it hadn't been for your money. And you didn't have any too much yourself. I know that. And you expected so much of me.\" \"It's all right; honestly, it's all right.\" But Colleen was struggling to make a clearer explanation. \"II have to helphelp Bob and the Red Cross and the farmers and everything that means America. You pioneers built such a wonderful country. We wouldn't be worth the dust of the plains if we couldn't protect it. I can't just study music not this year.\" And Sheila could only reiterate that everything was all right. After Colleen had hurried away, leaving perfume and remembrance of youth behind her, Sheila was doubly thankful that some of Maggie's old cronies had carried her off to sit with them. Absent-mindedly ~ she heard their laughter rise above the babble of talk around her. The balcony became crowded and boys began placing chairs in the aisles on the floor below. The small orchestra 91 filed in. Smiling, the Relief Society president took her seat beside Sheila and became absorbed in her officers sitting on her right. Sheila was grateful beyond expression to be let alone. Little Colleen and her shining diamond! Her courage and faith in America! It was queer the way life surged along. She thought of her years with John. If he had been able to love her as he had loved the wife of his early youth, would that have lessened her sense of unfulfillment? She thought of all she and Maggie and John had given to the land before it had begun to yield. She recalled her mother's privation, felt her horror of famine, and sat as though gripped in the silence of death. And as an accompaniment to the pageant of her mind, she heard the plaintive throbbing of the harp she had renounced. Sheila was so deeply stirred before the curtains parted that the ensuing scenes shook her to her depths. The portrayal of the long trek; handcarts inching through sand; weary voices singing, \"And if we die before our journey's through\" She scarcely knew what was her own dream, what was acting, and what was reality. Then with a little shock she was conscious of Colleen standing all alone on the dim stage at the foot of a covered wagon. Her auburn hair was demurely parted and arched by a small black bonnet. Her tiny waist was compressed into an unyielding basque. Her skirt, fluted and puffed here and there, fell to the floor. Plain white collars and cuffs softened the severity. Then, without accompaniment, her clear tones filled the hall: O my Father, Thou that dwellest In that high and glorious place, When shall I regain Thy presence, And again behold Thy face? Throughout the four verses she held the audience motionless; she was part of the sleeping encampment, part of the covered wagon, part of the endless plains, and of the still, unresponsive night. And all at once Sheila knew, with the true intuition of a born artist, that her people were too close to their struggles, too young in culture for a great expression. But some day a man or woman would look over the fertile fields of Utah and Idaho and see the land as it was primevally, ringing with the whoop of the Indian, the beat of the buffalo, and the shrill cry of the mountain lion. Or he would look at the imperial mountains and interpret with brush or pen their awful aloofness. It wouldn't be her heart strings aquiver, nor was it likely to be Colleen's. But some day it would come, for a great movement demands a great reproduction, and the message of her hills and plains had never been fitly expressed. And when the painting or play or novel came, her tears would be in it, and her yearning, for she and her parents and John and their friends had made a great work possible. But little Colleen, like Sheila herself, could sing the song of Zion \"in a strange land.\" 'Tears on the girl's rounded cheeks: Then at length, when I've completed All you sent me forth to do   Sheila's questioning eyes were lifted and for a moment she sat breathless. \"O God,\" her heart whispered, \"the redemption of man! After all, wasn't that the song of Zion?\" She knew that this was true, and knew also that the brush of Michelangelo, the imagination of Milton, and the pealing of an organ in a great cathedral could only suggest the beauty of a soul returned to God. With unconscious dignity shielded by the darkness, Sheila bowed her head. In a moment of realization she was paid for what the years had taken from her. She felt hot drops falling upon her folded hands, but the stabbing regret was gone. SHADOWS Roberta Bates Twilight and the shadows of the stars Fall soft and deep Into the stillness of a murmuring sea; So soon my shadow will have fallen Fallen deep Into the quiet darkness of eternity."

Funeral services were held in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square, in Salt Lake City, on January 19. All members of the First Presidency, the majority of the General Authorities, the Sunday School Union Board, and a host of friends and admirers of Superintendent Pyper were in attendance. Brother Pyper had been an xecutive officer of the Sunday School Union Board for more than forty years. He had also served the Church, the state, and the local community in many other capacities. He was endowed with very superior artistic abilities but his artistic interests and attainments in nowise curtailed his business and administrative abilities. This was manifested in his long and successful term, as manager of the Salt Lake Theatre and in his management of numerous pageants, musical and dramatic performances, and publications, many of which he either wrote or edited. (Guaeen D. PYPER, General In his youth and early manhood he served as clerk and later as judge of the Salt Lake City police court. This experience induced him to study law. These studies were, however, interrupted by a call to an extensive missionary tour in the company of Elders B. H. Roberts and Melvin J. Ballard. Numerous subsequent calls by both Church and state to important positions prevented Brother Pyper from resuming his legal studies. ELDER GEORGE D. PYPER To his intimate associates he was best known as a courteous, kind, sympathetic, and understanding friend; he was, indeed, a friend of man. While he was deeply religious, there was in him no trace of the pharisaical attitude so frequently denounced by Jesus. While he attended to all the details of the precepts of the Church, he emphasized the \"weightier matters of the law\"  justice, kindness, and integrity. His character was, in fact, the embodiment of these virtues. He had ever in mind the greatest of all the commandmentsthe love of God; this he expressed in the love and service of his fellow men. When they were in trouble they came to him for assistance with assurance that this assistance would be given to the limit of his ability. Page 93"

A home kept clean, tidy, harmonious, and beautiful... Good meals served graciously... A wife and mother who can take her work in her stride and come up glowing and unruffled to enjoy and be enjoyed by her family at the end of the daythese things are growing daily more vital to a sane indomitable America in a tense world.\" So says Dr. Louis E. Bisch, psychiatrist. True as is the above statement, it's asking a great deal of us women with spring cleaning practically upon us, especially this year with help so scarce we will have to do much of the work ourselves. Yes, it is asking a great deal, but the resourcefulness of womankind has never been denied, and with a little careful planning this problem can be solved successfully. Are you one of those housewives who favors a grand upheaval, ripping the house apart from top to bottom, wearing herself to shreds, and the family also, before everything is clean and in its place again? If you are, why not \"plan\" your seasonal cleaning this year so that the family will realize the cleaning has been completed not by the wear and tear on their dispositions, but by the shining beauty of their surroundings? I can almost hear many of you saying skeptically, \"Interesting, if true.\" Let me say that it can be true, and to prove it I'll give you my plan, which may be easily adapted to large or small houses and households. Page 116 I won't take space to tell you how to clean lampshades or do minor repair jobs, etc., because you may find all these directions in America's Housekeeping Book, the textbook for the Home Topic lessons of 1942- 43. This book answers almost anything one needs to know in connection with housekeeping. I start housecleaning late in February or early in March, depending upon the weather, and devote one or two days a week to cleaning until Ihave finished. First I tour the house with a note book in my hand, and note down a list of the needed repair jobs. This year, of course, there won't be any grand scale painting, etc., for obvious reasons, but there will be plenty of little things that always need fixing, such as a loose doorknob or a drawer that sticks. When I have completed my list, I then see that all these repairs are attended to before I start in on the real housecleaning. This is also the time I make new curtains or covers, etc. It's such a wonderful feeling to have them ready to use when the right times comes. MY first plunge takes me to the attic and basement. These floors need a regular cleaning and overhauling, especially now in wartime when so many of the useless articles that have accumulated over a period of years may be vitally needed and given away to swell the rubber, brass, or copper piles. I also start a pile consisting of clothing and household articles not needed in the war effort, to give to the Deseret Industries, PLANNED SPRING CLEANING adding to this pile as my housecleaning progresses. When I was in the mission field the rule was laid down that my companion and I should change our residence every three months. We decided that the real reason was not to make contacts with more people as much as to get rid of unnecessary articles. Today, my spring cleaning serves the same purpose to me as a move, and is much more easily accomplished. After the attic and basement are attended to (and my husband usually helps with the hard cleaning there), I turn my attention to the kitchen, back hall and bath. At this point I can't resist mentioning how I wash walls and painted surfaces. All my walls except two bedrooms happen to be covered with walltex of a slightly rough texture. First I wash these walls with a mild solution of tri-sodium-sulphate, and then rinse them with a solution of diluted cooked starch. You will be surprised how easily the soil will come off at the next claning time since the dirt will all be on the starch. In my kitchen I first clean the cupboards and dishes, then the ceiling and walls and finally the floors. The house doesn't seem half so dirty with these rooms fresh and clean. The next job I undertake is cleaning and straightening all dresser drawers, the rest of the cupboards, and closets. Everything is taken out and drawers, walls, and shelves are washed thoroughly. I also use a good spray if there is danger from moths. Fresh paper is placed in the drawers and I begin to restore order. This is the time I add to the material for the Deseret Industries, discarding 117 those articles I can't use or make over for the children. Out-of-season clothes are hung away in moth proof bags, and place is made for articles to be needed in the near future. I then clean the two wall papered bedrooms, first washing the curtains so they can be ironed and hung when all else is done. The walls and ccilings are cleaned with a dough-like preparation, with a thorough brushing afterward to remove crumbs that may cling to walls and baseboards. After I have washed the woodwork and windows, I then do the floors, scrubbing the one bedroom rug or sending it out to be cleaned, and cleaning and waxing the wooden  floor of the other bedroom. Since the children's bedroom has washable walls I clean them when I do the front hall, the procedure being much the same as for the kitchen and bath. The final windup brings me to the living and dining rooms. Draperies are cleaned so they will be ready to hang when all other cleaning in these rooms is completed. I make good use of the vacuum appliances on upholstered furniture, etc. After the walls, windows, and woodwork have been washed, and the carpeted floor vacuumed (or cleaned if the carpet needs cleaning), and furniture polished, I hang the draperies, replace pictures, lamps and bric-a-brac. By cleaning according to this plan doing a little each week and starting eafly in the seasonyour housecleaning may be accomplished without exerting much more effort than would be expended on your regular cleaning days. Yes, it is wonderful what a little planning will do to make your housecleaning easy!"

            "content": "Flag Etiquette Due to many questions on proper flag etiquette which have arisen as the result of the entrance of the United States into World War II, the following information is presented to the readers of TheIt is reprinted by courtesy of The National Americanism Commission, The American Legion, Indianapolis, Indiana, from its bulletin, \"Let's Be Right on Flag Etiquette.\" Is it proper to fly the Flag of the A. No; it is not necessary to salute United States of America outdoors all night long now that the reproductions or photographs of the Flag. United States is engaged in war? Q. Is it necessary for a person to Flag should be displayed outdoors A. If the National Anthem is sung only from sunrise until sunset. The only cases where the. Flag properly flies at night are: 1Two Flags over the Capitol Building in Washington; one over the east front and one over the west front, day and night throughout the year. 2Over a permanent fort or ship when engaged in battle.. Is it necessary for a person to stand and salutewhenareproduction of the Flag of the United States of America is flashed on a motion picture screen? Page 118 by the entire audience, those persons present should: stand, but not salute. If the National Anthem is sung by a soloist accompanied by a band, orchestra or other musical instruments and the Flag is displayed, the audience should stand at attention and salute; those present in uniform using the right hand military salute and those in civilian dress, thecivilian salute (placing the right hand over the heart). When the National Anthem. No. The rules of civilian flag etiquette still govern, and the stand and salute when the National Anthem is sung? FLAG ETIQUETTE is played and/or sung by a soloist and the Flag is not displayed, those in uniform salute and those in civilian dress merely stand and face the music, men removing the headdress. Q. What should persons do when they are walking along the street and \"The Star Spangled Banner\" ls heard? A. If the music is near, you should stop, stand at attention and uncover. Q. Is it necessary for a person to stand and salute when the National Anthem is played over a loud speaker arrangement, film tract, radio, \"juke box\" or other type of a musical reproduction machine in a theater, restaurant, or other public place? A. No. It is recommended that persons pay respect only when the National Anthem is played by a band, orchestra or other musical instrument actually in the room. However, Colonel James A. Moss (deceased), who was head of the United States Flag Association and who was recognized throughout the nation as an authority on flag etiquette, has several answers to the question of what one should do when \"The Star Spangled Banner\" is heard over the radio. He says, \"It depends on circumstances. Generally speaking if it seems natural and not forced to stand and uncover, it should be done; otherwise, it should not. For example,' if eating at table, lying in bed, or working in the kitchen, standing at attention would be forced and unnatural.\" The office of the National 119 Americanism Commission  believes that when the National Anthem is played over a radio or in a restaurant from a \"juke box\" or some other type of musical reproduction machine, or in a theater over a film tract, here again it would seem more or less forced and unnatural to pay respect. Is it proper to stand when \"America, \"\"God Bless America,\" \"The Red, White and Blue\" and other such patriotic songs are played?. No; it is not proper. Has a change been made in the position of the right arm and hand while pledging allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America? Or A. No; there has been no change. The procedure set forth in the Flag Code is still recommended and that procedure is as follows: PLEDGE TO THE FLAG In pledging allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, the approved practice in schools, which is suitable also for civilian adults, is as follows: Standing with the right hand over the heart, all repeat together the following pledge: \"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" At the words \"to the Flag,\" the right hand is extended, palm upward, toward the Flag, and this position is held until the end, when the hand, after the words, \"Justice for all,\" drops to the side. However, civilian adults will always show full respect to the Flag, when the pledge is being given, by merely standing at attention, men removing the headdress. Persons in uniform should render the right hand salute. Q. Can the Flag be washed or drycleaned? A. Yes; it is permissible to wash or dry-clean the Flag. Q. In displaying the Flag flat, either horizontally or vertically, in the window of a home or place of business, or flat against the wall, what should be the position of the Flag? A. It should be displayed with the union (blue field with stars) to the left of the observer in the Street. Q. In what position should the Flag be when suspended vertically over the middle of the street? A. In a north and south street the union (field of blue) should be to the east, and in an east and west street, it should be to the north.

Luncheon was served in the amusement hall at long tables. The president's table was centered with a beautifully decorated, tiered birthday cake trimmed in blue and gold, with 100 blue and gold candles on it. Over the top was an arch on which were inscribed the words 'Charity Never Faileth.\" Our tree-planting ceremony consisted of talks and musical numbers, the dedication being made by our ward bishop. A spirit of companionship and sisterly love prevailed throughout the observance, and all who participated in this occasion will long remember: Morgan Stake (Morgan, Utah) MARGARET WHITTIER, former president of the Milton Ward Relief Society, reviewed this ward's centennial activities as follows: \"We observed the one-hundredth birthday of the Relief Society in the Milton Ward Chapel, Tuesday, March 17, 1942. The program commenced at two o'clock and consisted of song, music, and Relief Society history. Margaret Whittier gave the opening address of welcome. Two of the outstanding features of the occasion were the participation on the program of elderly members of our Society, and the playing of the recorded messages from President Heber J. Grant and President Amy Brown Lyman. After the program, a banquet was held in the recreation hall. The table was centered with a beautifully decorated birthday cake iced in Relief Society colors, topped with the number 100 in gold. Cynthia Criddle, oldest past Relief Society president in the ward, cut the cake. Due to weather conditions, our centennial treea flowering crabwas not planted until a month later, when a special program was presented. This program included a tribute to Relief Society by W. E. Criddle, a poem \"I Planted a Tree,\" and a violin solo, \"Trees.\" Joseph F. Spendlove offered the dedicatory prayer.\"\nNorth Sanpete Stake (Mount Pleasant, Utah)\n\"TALULA F. NELSON and Johanna O. Peel, presidents, respectively, of the Mount Pleasant North and South Ward Relief Societies, sent the following account of a joint celebration held March 17, 1942: \"The two Mt. Pleasant Wards of the North Sanpete Stake Relief Society, with Ruby S. Jensen, stake president, celebrated the centennial birthday of Relief Society on March 17 in the South Ward chapel. The radio broadcast from the Relief Society General Board over KSL the morning of March 17 was an inspirational setting for the day for all those who listened. All members and eligible members of the Relief Society and their partners, were invited to assemble at eleven o'clock in the morning. As the guests entered, each wrote his name on a sheet of paper. This list of names, along with a description of the activities of the day, notes about present world conditions, and some relics were sealed up in a tin can to be opened in fifty years. \"At twelve o'clock our program started in the recreation room by singing 'A Hundred Thousand Strong.' Prayer was offered by Patriarch Arthur O. Neilson. Following this, an old-fashioned hot dinner of beef stew with vegetables, and rice pudding was served in cafeteria style from three long tables. The serving was done by twelve menhusbands and sons of Relief Society membersdressed in white shirts, long white aprons, and white caps trimmed in blue. They looked handsome and were applauded as they came in to serve. \"The program was varied and made interesting by touches of humor. Talks were given highlighting points in ward Relief Society history. Other features were a candle-lighting ceremony, the presentation of 100 birthday pennies to each ward Primary organization with responses from Primary children, the singing of 'Happy Birthday,' modern and old-time dancing in costume, and the unveiling of centennial quilts. The program included a short pageant. Since quilting is a typical Relief Society activity, each ward made a special quilt for this occasion. The North Ward quilt was a beautiful creationred and blue on a white background. The South Ward quilt was blue and gold, with the names of all present ward Relief Society members embroidered in blue in a triangle on a gold background, and the border was quilted in a sego lily design. It is intended that this quilt be preserved for a century. \"After a short intermission, the sacred part of our program was presented in the chapel. The Singing Mothers sang two new songs composed for the occasion, and the transcribed messages of President Grant and President Lyman were played. In addition, a short history of the life of Margaret F. Cruckshank Morrison, who served forty years as first president of the Mt. Pleasant Relief Society, was told in combination radio and pageant form, with Alice J. Stewart representing Mrs. Morrison. The benediction was pronounced by Myranda S. P.

The day was lovely, and as members entered the chapel they heard the strains of organ music, and were greeted by our Relief Society officers. Our chorus, under the direction of Lola Sebiess, chorister, and Sue Bowen, organist, gave a fine rendition of 'Spirit of God,' 'My Heart is a Silent Violin,' and 'Peace I Leave With You.' Our play, \"The Organization of the Relief Society in Nauvoo,' was taken from the March 1932 issue of the Magazine, and was directed by Lucile Pack, with Helen West as the reader. The play was very well acted, and all who took part in it deserve our praise. The candle-lighting ceremony was very impressive. The reader, Melvina Sutton, gave a tribute to each of the eight general presidents of Relief Society while the candles were being lighted.\" A luncheon, served to 176 guests, was also part of the festivities (see accompanying picture). \"All in all, the whole program was praiseworthy, and everyone enjoyed it.

        "content": "Brigham Young University in Provo, the Distinguished Alumnus Award as \"an expression of esteem for meritorious achievements, which have brought honor and distinction to Alma Mater and inspiration to her Alumni.\" Only one other woman has been so honored. On January 1, 1940, Mrs. Lyman was honored by being appointed and set apart as general president of the Latter-day Saint Relief Society. It was not by chance that these three experiences came to her; it was, rather, that the growing girl and woman kept the path on which the child had set her feet at a tender age. 'That was the path of service, of devotion to the Gospel, of excelling at the task at hand. Amy Brown excelled because she was both gifted and ambitious. She was the good servant who used to the best advantage the talents with which the Master had entrusted her. Quick, both mentally and physically, and unafraid of hard work, she utilized every opportunity for learning. Amy Lyman owes part of her success to her inheritance and to wise parental direction. She was born February 7, 1872, in the pretty, fertile town of Pleasant Grove, Utah, at the foot of towering Mount Timpanogos with its mantle of perpetual snow. Her father, John Brown, when converted to Mormonism, was a school teacher, preparing for the Baptist ministry. He served for almost a generation both as bishop and mayor of Pleasant Grove. He was honorable, _ self-controlled, gentlemanly, and deeply religious. In his large family every principle and practice of the Gospel was strictly observed. Sister Lyman's advice to girls who sometimes feel to ques- 145 tion certain points of doctrine or procedure has always been, \"When in doubt, be orthodox.\" Amy's mother, Margaret Zimmerman Brown, was the daughter of a German university graduate who came to America for greater freedom. The Zimmerman ancestors in Germany had held high offices at court and were professional men, writers, and educators. No wonder Amy Brown was an outstanding teacher. Nor need we be surprised at the literary style of her charming and honest autobiography, published in The Relief Society Magazine during the centennial year of the Society, 1942. Margaret Brown loved culture and education, and a well-ordered home. Even under difficult pioneer conditions, she taught her daughters to be clean, thrifty, and industrious housekeepers. Despite all of Mrs. Lyman's public work, she has made her dwelling a house of order always, and a genuine and hospitable home. Mrs. Brown was a natural manager, and even when a partial invalid confined to her bed, not only directed her own household, butsought outby neighbors and friends helped to settle many personal and community problems as well. Like her mother, Mrs. Lyman has had the ability to follow the personal lives of a host of friends, rejoicing intimately with them, and often weeping a quiet tear for their SOROWS.. Mrs. Brown once helped to organize and find an instructor for a class in nursing and obstetrics for the benefit of the women of Pleasant Grove. Daughter Amy returned from her year's teaching in Provo, worn out and anticipating a rest. But no, her mother informed her that she was to enter the nursing class next morning. Amy was there, obedient and ready to add to her store of practical knowledge. Already she could milk cows, tend pigs, chickens, and a garden, dry fruits, sew, cook, wash and iron. There was, however, some time for recreation, such as picnics, dances, candy pulls, or home dramatic entertainments. AFTER completing the elementary schools in Pleasant Grove, Amy spent some of her happiest years at the Bingham Young Academy in Provo. Her hungry mind was fed by able teachers, especially the gifted Dr. Karl G. Maeser, head of the institution, at whose home she was privileged to board. The spirit of the Gospel permeated every activity of that Church school, and gave new meaning to the age-old problems with which educators struggle. While at the Academy, Amy became engaged to a fellow student, handsome Richard R. Lyman, now an apostle. He later went East to study engineering, while Amy taught for four years in the training school of the Academy. She also gave instruction in needlework and physical education, and was matron for a time. In 1895 Amy accompanied her prospective father-in-law, President Francis M. Lyman, to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for Richard's graduation exercises. Richard was one of the most popular students in the school, and this was a time of romance, charming companions, social functions, and pretty clothes. James B. Angell, the university president, received most cordially in his office for  a personal chat, President Lyman, Richard, and Amy. Amy returned to Salt Lake City and taught school. Then, in 1896, she married Richard Lyman, head of the Civil Engineering Department: of the University of Utah. She made a charming home for him, which she also opened to his four motherless brothers and sisters attending school in Salt Lake. Mrs. Lyman herself took some work at the University of Utah, and in 1902-04, when she accompanied her husband East for post-graduate work, she also attended classes at the University of Chicago and at Cornell. The Lymans had two children, Wendell, deceased, whose daughter, Amy Kathryn, has been a member of her grandparents' household since infancy, and Margaret, wife of the celebrated organist, Alexander Schreiner. Sister Lyman was called to the Relief Society General Board in 1909. She has served as assistant secretary, general secretary, and first counselor, as well as president. Possessing a strong sense of the importance of records and history, Sister Lyman had the Relief Society minutes from 1842 to 1928 copied, indexed, and bound in uniform covers. She collected much valuable material, had stake reports bound in volumes, and arranged a comprehensive ward record book which systematized the work of secretaries and treasurers. She was chairman of the committee which prepared the Relief Society Handbook. Similar record books and handbooks were compiled for the European missions while she officiated there. During World War I, Mrs. Ly- 146 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEFEBRUARY 1943 ~ LESSON DEPARTMENT 'man, as a Relief Society welfare worker, took a course in social work in Denver given by the Red Cross, as preparation for aiding the families of Latter-day Saint soldiers and sailors. Since then, she has given much attention to social work, taking courses, supervising Relief Society social work, and teaching classes of Relief Society women, to demonstrate improved methods in social work, Mrs. Lyman has been a Utah representative at many National Conferences of Social Work, and also holds a membership in Pi Gamma Mu, National Honorary Social Science Society of America. Mrs. Lyman carried her desire for human betterment into the Utah State Legislature, where she was a representative in 1923 and chairman of Public Health. Later she worked for the establishment of the Utah State Training School for sub-normal children and when this was effected, she became a member of its board of trustees.. Mrs. Lyman is listed in \"Who's Who.\" Many times she has been a delegate to the National Council of Women, and has held the offices of recording secretary, auditor, and third vice-president of this organization. 'Three times the national president has appointed her a delegate to the International Council of Women. The last two meetings, in Yugoslavia and Scotland, occurred during her residence in Europe when President Richard R. Lyman was presiding over the European Mission. The delegates were entertained by royalty, and met many per. Sons of international note. Sister Lyman visited all the 147 Latter-day Saint missions of Europe, giving encouragement and help to the faithful women there. In Great Britain, where she traveled frequently to the various conferences, she was greatly admired and beloved. For two years Sister Lyman and her Board have exerted every effort to make the Relief Society Centennial memorable. Membership was increased from 75,000 in 1938 to 115,000 in 1942. Even though war conditions required the cancellation of conference plans including an elaborate pageant, beautiful ward programs were carried out, and phonograph records with personal greetings from President Lyman and a blessing and benediction from President Heber J. Grant were sent to the wards and to branches wherever possible. At Sister Lyman's suggestion, hardwood trees were planted throughout the Church in commemoration of the occasion. The General Board planted an English elm on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. An anthology of verse by Mormon women, and a commemorative book of Relief Society activities of the century, were published. Souvenir plates were  made, picturing the first Relief Society meeting. Three interesting and informative broadcasts reached thousands of listeners over radio station KSL. In spite of the disappointment of altered plans, the seventeenth of March 1942 was a memorable occasion throughout the Church. Sister Lyman is especially well equipped to be general president of the Relief Society. Her life-long fidelity to the Gospel, her thirty-three years' service on the Board, her thorough education and executive ability, and her faith in the Gospel and obedience to the Priesthoodall are of value. Her personal charm, beauty, and sense of humor, her 'ability to cooperate, her common sense and generous appreciation of the efforts of her associatesthese qualities also have their place. Of special importance is her honest and farreaching outlook on social and economic questions, whichof crucial importance todaywill sorely vex the post-war world. The wisdom, faith, experience, and efficiency of Sister Lyman qualify her to preside over the Relief Society at this time.

It seems to have been inspired by the periods of thanksgiving and prayer which were proclaimed at intervals during the war. A few days after the first observance of a national Thanksgiving Day, occurring on the last Thursday in November, 1863, a movement was put on foot which found its culmination in an act passed April 22, 1864, providing for the familiar slogan on our metal money. \"Thus two significant contributions to the religious life of the nation were accomplished during the administration of Lincoln. 'The setting apart of one day in each year which has become our annual Thanksgiving Festival and the imprinting upon our coins a motto which indicates that ours is a nation with religious ideals. \"A clergyman by the name of M. R. Watkinson, who lived at Riddleyville, Pennsylvania, possibly was the first one to make a direct appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States with respect to placing on its coins an appropriate religious inscription. Under the date of November 13, 1861, he wrote observing that \"One fact touching our currency has hitherto been seriously overlooked. I mean the recognition of the Almighty God in some form on our coins.' Watkinson's thought was that the words 'God, liberty, law' might suffice with the 'all seeing eye' somewhere displayed on the coins. \"One week after Mr. Chase received this letter from the Pennsylvania clergyman, he addressed a note to James Pollock, Director of the mint,... In which he expressed the following sentiment, No nation can be strong except in the strength of God, nor safe except in His defense. The trust of our people in God should be declared on our national coins. You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest and tersest words possible, this national recognition.'... \",. These words of Lincoln must have inspired both Chase and Pollock to further action: Whereas, the Senate devoutly recognizing the supreme authority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of men and of nations, has by a resolution requested the President to designate and set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation: And Whereas, it is the duty of nations as well as of men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God; to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord:...' \"... After many conferences and the preparation of a lengthy memorandum by Mr. Pollock, steps were taken to bring about the desired end. The necessity of a very brief inscription was submitted and such phrases as, 'God Our Trust,' 'Our Country; Our God,' and 'In God We Trust' were suggested in the memorandum, with a preference for the first one mentioned. Mr. Chase, however, preferred the last one, believing that 'In God We 'Trust' would be 'more effective and direct.'... \"On April 22, 1864, an act was Page 149 150 passed which authorized the coinage of a two-cent piece, the inscription and size of the coin to be fixed by the director of the mint. This now obscure piece of money was the first coin to bear the inscription, 'In God We Trust.' \"Just about a month before the as Here are Five GREAT BOOKS GOSPEL STANDARDS, by Pres. Heber J.

The following interesting description of the physical appearance of George Washington was written by a friend, George Mercer, in 1760.\n\"As straight as an Indian, measuring six feet two inches in his stockings and weighing 175 pounds.... His frame is padded with well-developed muscles, indicating great strength. His bones and joints are large.... He is wide shouldered,...

A large and straight rather than a prominent nose; blue-gray penetrating eyes, which are widely separated, and overhung by a heavy brow. His face is long rather than broad, with high, round cheek bones, and terminates in a good firm chin. He has a clear though rather a colorless pale skin, which burns with the sun. A pleasing, benevolent, though a commanding countenance, dark brown hair, which he wears in a cue. His mouth is large and generally firmly closed.... His features are regular and placid, with all the muscles of his face under perfect control, though flexible and expressive of deep feeling when moved by emotion. In conversation he looks you full in the face, is deliberate, deferential, and engaging. His voice is agreeable rather than strong. His demeanor at all times composed and dignified.

            "content": "Compassionate Service\nElder George Albert Smith Member of the Council of the Twelve\n\"Inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of these.\"\nONE hundred years ago, in the then thriving city of Nauvoo, Illinois, the greatest association in the world for the benefit of women was brought into being. Organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith, who two years later gave his life as a martyr for truth, this splendid benevolent association has continued to grow until today it numbers 115,000 of the most unselfish and intelligent women to be found in the world.\nThe city of its birth, at that time the largest in the state of Illinois, had a population of more than 20,000. It was later destroyed by mob violence and the good people responsible for building and naming it were driven into the wilderness. They traveled more than 1500 miles over the plains and mountains, through a country infested with Indians and wild animals. They arrived in the desolate Salt Lake Valley and began again to lay the foundation of civilization.\nToday Nauvoo is a village of approximately 1,000 people, without a railroad or street car line. But the Relief Society that was cruelly driven out with the Church has continued to grow until it has units in hundreds of cities and villages in many parts of the world. For each individual now living in Nauvoo, the Relief Society has more than 100 members. They are fine citizens of many nations and islands of the sea. The teachings and ideals of the Society are an inspiration to all women who apply them in their lives, regardless of where they live or to what race or creed they may belong. No matter how many virtues one may possess, the teachings of the Society encourage the acquisition of more, perfection being the ultimate aim.\nYour General Presidents have been great souls, worthy to be called daughters of God. They have been chosen because of their intelligence and willingness to serve unselfishly for the benefit of all, and they have sought to surround themselves with women who have been willing, if necessary, to travel to the remote\nPage 153\n154\nparts of the earth to supervise the organization of societies to teach the mothers of men how to fit into the responsibilities of earth life in a manner pleasing to our Heavenly Father.\nI have witnessed the results of Relief Society influence at home and abroad. My soul has been filled with gratitude as I have observed the development of those who are attempting to measure up to the standards set by our Heavenly Father for his daughters in the progressive program of this great organization.\nMy travels have taken me from Alaska and Norway in the far north to Australia and New Zealand in the far south, and to many of the nations between. I have found the Relief Society operating for the benefit of all who would participate both in and out of the Church. The Organization has functioned as an auxiliary in the largest and strongest wards of the Church and in the smallest branches in all parts of the world where the Gospel has been taught. It has been an aid to the Priesthood and the women have assisted in all charitable work, particularly caring for their own sex. In many nations and upon the islands of the sea I have observed the members of your society in action, encouraging the despondent, pleading with the wayward, praying with the sick and disabled, always unselfishly seeking the guidance and inspiration of the Almighty for the soul in distress. Their ministrations are all-inclusive from the cradle to the grave.\nIn remote branches of the Church your associates have traveled through the heat of summer and the cold of winter to minister to the helpless and\nneedy. They have waded through the mud and the snow, entirely unmindful of their own discomfort, to nurse the sick, and in hundreds of cases assuage the pain of women in labor, and, in the absence of a doctor or trained nurse, have delivered babies and cared for the mother successfully.\nThe development and accomplishments of the women of this sisterhood are almost like a fairy tale, so unusual is the story. Women hold a place in civilization no less important than men, and but for their modesty and reserve, they would often supersede men in many important positions in government and industry.\nTHE program of the Relief Society is developed in the interest of all people. Realizing that the home is the foundation of civilization and happiness, these women exert a modifying influence calculated to make our homes havens of rest and peace. All those dwelling therein may enjoy, in some measure, a taste of what heaven will be. Not only does the Society function as a benevolent organization but it aims to develop in the human soul a love of true religion. It encourages an appreciation of art, literature, music, science, and the beautifying and sanctifying of home. This and much more that enriches life is a part of the Relief Society plan. True education in every essential is sought after. Women who have excelled in some department of life gladly share their information with those less fortunate, the result being that the second and third generations have often enjoyed advantages they could not have had but for the\nCOMPASSIONATE SERVICE\ngenerous women who have made them possible. The advice of the Prophet was that women should \"provoke the brethren to good works.\" In times like these the members of the Relief Society should encourage their husbands and sons to do their full duty in sustaining the ideals of the Church and the nation, and in doing their full part to maintain what is still left of civilization.\nThe self-sacrifice of the members has been a bulwark against selfishness and has been a great strength to the Church from the time of its inception. Cheerfulness is a characteristic of the sisters who visit among the people, and because of their love and tactfulness many a dull day has been brightened in homes where women were sad and where, due to overwork and other distresses, women were discouraged.\nNo other group in all the world has rendered more desirable service in time of need. In all parts of the world women have discharged their obligations as wives and mothers, looking largely to the benefits to be derived in mortality; but I know of no other organization that programs for and insists that women should be given opportunities equal to men in the same wholesome way that has been enjoyed by your membership. The lives of women in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and that of course means all our women, have been precious to the men because they expect to have their companionship throughout the ages of eternity.\nUPON one occasion I was talking to a man who was a great philanthropist. The question of \n155\nmarriage entered into the conversation and I explained to him that the marriage that was recognized as a Church marriage by the Latter-day Saints was one not only for time but for eternity. I told him that we expect to enjoy our family life in immortality, to associate with one another as parents and children in the Celestial Kingdom right here on this earth throughout the ages of eternity. I explained that in due time all expected to pass away; but the Lord had revealed to us that those who were worthy would be permitted to continue their lives in immortality upon this earth when it has been cleansed and purified and becomes the Celestial Kingdom. Husbands will have their wives, wives will have their husbands, and parents and children will enjoy eternal companionship.\nI will never forget the fervor with which he expressed himself when he said, \"If all the world could know that and believe it, what a difference it would make in the treatment that men and women would accord to each other, and that parents would bestow upon their children.\"\nThese things are known to Relief Society sisters, and knowing it, you have power to bring peace and comfort, happiness and satisfaction, to those who need you where other women would fail entirely. You are to be congratulated that you possess the knowledge that every good thing that the people of the world enjoy, you may enjoy, and in addition that you may draw near to your Heavenly Father in prayer, and begin the consecration of your lives right here on earth and be prepared for eternal happiness in the Celestial Kingdom.\n156\nYour strength is not in might but in the power of righteousness. The faithful, progressive members of Relief Society will be given added courage and strength to meet the problems of today that parallel those which confronted the Relief Society in its inception. In the beginning you were asked to help in the Latter-day Saint struggle for freedom and progress. Today you do not have to struggle alone, but lend your efforts, and lead the way for millions of women throughout this war torn world who are giving their all to preserve freedom and democracy.\nIn different parts of the world families are being exiled. Men and women are being shipped to war zones. The adversary of all righteousness is spreading destruction. The devoted women of the Society may wield great influence in strengthening their husbands, brothers, and sons in their patriotic contributions and their determination to be worthy of their heritage.\nIt is not only your privilege but your duty, as the hard-working domestic executive in your family, to take advantage of every intelligent program placed in your hands. New, modern, scientific courses in nutrition are available without expense. Be certain that you transfer your training into your daily life, thus protecting your families from malnourishment in the lean years ahead. The current courses in nursing will teach you to skilfully care for your own afflicted loved ones in a correct manner. Thus it will relieve the crowded condition in hospitals and leave more space for the acutely afflicted who need skilled and scientific attention.\nIt is important that you complete the new course in first aid and canteen work. No one can tell when or where that information may be of utmost value to you or your community. Nurses' aids are needed in local hospitals all over the nation to help replace those who have left for active war duty. This instruction is available, and whenever and wherever you have the time, training, and opportunity, it is desirable for you to volunteer in this fine humanitarian service.\nBy doing home canning you will relieve the pressure on industry. More canned foods will be available for our own armed forces and our oppressed Allies. It is essential that your ward emergency program be completed, your war chest filled, and first-aid kits prepared for every home situated in dangerous areas. All of these things are \"firsts.\" Then if your time, talents, and energy can be budgeted to help in the war industry and you can make this additional contribution, knowing your home is not neglected, do so and our Heavenly Father will reward you for your added efforts.\nNo matter where you work or in what manner you serve, be sure that you keep your word. Give 100 per cent service and always be dependable. Once you have accepted an assignment, no matter how large or small, never fail to perform your part. You may think that you are only a small link in the chain of cooperative effort but remember no chain is stronger than its weakest link.\nAS you face the second year of the second century of Relief Society\nCOMPASSIONATE SERVICE\nfollow the pattern of your sisters who started the first year of the first century, and anchor your faith in God. Be helpful, prayerful, humble, and full of courage. Democracy is at stake, and it will be your duty to bolster the morale of your own families, allay their fears, supplant terror and uncertainty with faith, and smilingly meet the dawn of each day until victory is won.\nI have no way of expressing to you my admiration and appreciation for the wonderful service that your\n157\norganization has rendered under almost every conceivable circumstance through which men and women are required to pass. In the palaces of the rich and in the modest homes of the poor, you radiate the same sweet influence and bestow the same smile of approbation for the good things that you see as you mingle among your associates. The riches of eternity will flow to every one of you, who, as a daughter of Zion, honors her Heavenly Father and seeks to be worthy of His love."

            "content": "The House of the Lord Shall Be Established in the Top of the Mountains\nAnn P. Nibley Member of Relief Society General Board\nTHE annual conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held in April, 1893, fifty years ago, was an historic event. It was the occasion of the completion and dedication of the great Salt Lake Temple. For more than forty years the Saints had labored, under almost insurmountable difficulties, to complete this sacred structure; now it was finished, and stood as \"an object of wonder, and admiration to the visitor, and a subject of sanctifying joy and righteous pride to the people, whose sacrifice and effort had given it being.\"\nOn July 28, 1847, four days after the arrival of the first group of pioneers, on the desolate site which is now beautiful Salt Lake City, President Brigham Young, while walking over the ground where the temple now stands, thrust his cane into the parched soil and exclaimed, 'Here we will build the Temple of our God.\" From that time this place became known as Temple Block and the people looked upon it as \"hallowed ground.\"\nAt the general conference of the Church in April 1851, the construction of the temple was approved by official vote. Let us remember that this decision was made by a group of impoverished and isolated people, menaced by hostile Indians and struggling for existence in a desert land. Because of these many difficulties and hardships the work was delayed until almost six years after the arrival of the pioneers. On February 14, 1853, when the site was finally dedicated and the ground was broken, the occasion was one of greatest rejoicing. On the 6th of April, 1853, the corner stones were laid. During these ceremonies of thanksgiving many civic and military organizations took part, \"there were processions with bands of music and solemn services with prayer.\"\nHowever, the work now so eagerly begun was not to be continued without further delay. In the spring of 1858 the coming of Johnston's Army to Utah \"had been heralded with dire threats of violence,\"the saints had not forgotten the \"harrowing scenes\" of persecution in Missouri and Illinois and rather than suffer a repetition of these events they prepared to abandon their homes and seek refuge in the desert. \"In the saddening preparation for departure the people carefully covered the foundation work on the site of the Temple; excavations were refilled and every vestige of masonry was obscured.... When the covering up process was complete, the site showed nothing more attractive than a remote resemblance\nPage 159\n160\nONE OF FOUR MAIN DOORS OF SALT LAKE TEMPLE\nThe lower panel is of oak and the upper two are of bevelled plate glass protected by bronze grills of intricate pattern carrying the beehive motif. The doorstep, hardware attachments, and doorknobs are of bronze.\nto the barren stretch of a roughly plowed field.\"\nFortunately a peaceable agreement was made between the people and the army, and in July 1858 the Saints returned to their homes. Later when resuming the work on the temple it was found that the material used in the foundation was not of a stable character. Consequently, by years of toil it was removed, and stone of better quality was substituted. In 1877, at which time the granite walls of the great structure had reached a height of twenty feet,\nPresident Brigham Young, the beloved leader, passed away. For another decade the work was carried on by his successor, President John Taylor and thereafter was continued under the direction of Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the Church. Work now went on with little interruption. However circumstances at times conspired to retard and make the progress slow, \"but when in place of three or four yoke of oxen being necessary to the transportation of a single stone from the quarry twenty miles distant, there came the change of conditions wrought by the railroad, the walls grew with greater rapidity and when at length the time came for the laying of the capstone... The anxiety of the people to complete the structure seemed to burst forth like a pent up flood.\"\nOn April 6, 1892, at one of the greatest gatherings ever to take place in Utah, the capstone of the temple was placed in position. \"The day marked the close of the annual conference, and was hallowed by all the observances of solemn assembly. As a preliminary to the principal ceremony, a vast congregation had assembled in the Tabernacle at an early hour, and in this assembly the several organizations of the Priesthood occupied distinctive places on the main floor while the galleries were reserved for the accommodations of the general public.\n\"At the close of an impressive service the multitude proceeded in formal procession to the open space on the south side of the Temple, where a temporary platform had been erected with the flag of the nation waving above. An adjoining stand accommo-\nTHE HOUSE OF THE LORD\ndated the choir which numbered over 200 singers. There was band music of the highest order and every essential element of fervent worship combined with joyous celebration had been provided.\"\nOver 40,000 people were on the Temple Block to celebrate this occasion, while many thousands more, unable to find a place, stood in the streets or looked down from windows and roofs of surrounding buildings. One year from this notable event the last \"finishing touches\" to the interior of the sacred and beloved structure were made, and on the evening of the 5th of April, the day preceding the dedication, the majestic temple, now completed, was opened for general inspection. On this occasion not only were members of the Church admitted but hundreds of \"honorable\" men and women who did not belong to the Church were invited to pass through.\nWhen the great day for the dedication arrived, the Saints gathered\n161\nfrom far and near until it was estimated that at least 25,000 people had come to the city to witness the ceremonies. Elder James E. Talmage relates: \"On the morning of the 6th of April, 1893, Wilford Woodruff, President of the Church, led the way through the southwest door into the sacred precincts.... He was followed by general authorities of the Church. And these in turn by other Church officials and such members as had been especially designated to take part in the first dedication service. Of the tens of thousands of Saints who desired to be present, whose rightful privilege it was to attend, but few could be accommodated on the day of the dedication. The assembly room, which with its vestries occupies the entire floor, had been furnished with seating accommodations for 2,252 persons. It was arranged therefore that services be repeated twice daily to continue from April 6th until all who were\nSALT LAKE TEMPLE DEDICATION SERVICES Thursday, April 6th, 1893. ADMIT ONE MORNING SESSION.\nCARD OF ADMITTANCE TO DEDICATION SERVICES\n162\nentitled to admission had had opportunity to be present.\"\nAt the first service, the official dedication, the dedicatory prayer was offered by President Wilford Woodruff. This dedicatory prayer was read at each succeeding session. One paragraph of this beautiful prayer follows:\n\"We come before Thee with joy and thanksgiving, with spirits jubilant and hearts filled with praise, that Thou has permitted us to see this day, for which, during these forty years, we have hoped and toiled and prayed, when we can dedicate unto Thee this house, which we have built to Thy most glorious name. One year ago we set the capstone, with shouts of Hosanna to God and the Lamb. And today we dedicate the whole unto Thee, with all that pertains unto it, that it may be holy in Thy sight; that it may be a house of prayer, a house of praise and of worship; that Thy glory may rest upon it; that Thy Holy Presence may be continually in it; that it may be the abode of Thy Well-Beloved Son, our Savior; that the angels who stand before Thy face may be the hallowed messengers who shall visit it, bearing to us Thy wishes and Thy will, that it may be sanctified and consecrated in all its parts unto Thee, the God of Israel, the Almighty ruler of mankind. And we pray Thee that all people who enter upon the threshold of this, Thine house, may feel Thy power, and be constrained to acknowledge that Thou hast sanctified it, that it is Thy house.\"\n\"This prayer itself is at once a sermon and a supplication; it is expressive of the inmost thoughts of the people; it is an epitome of the history\nof the Saints and the condition of the Church at the time....\n\"A large pipe organ had been set up in the assembly room, and served as an accompaniment to the Choir of [300] selected voices, by whom the anthems and the hymns, especially composed for the occasion were rendered. The essential and characteristic feature of the service was, of course, the offering of the dedicatory prayer, and to this were added brief addresses by officials of the Church. Throughout the service ran the solemn refrain, which was voiced in anthem, sermon, and prayer: \"THE HOUSE OF THE LORD IS COMPLETED.\"\nThese words were uttered by Elder B. H. Roberts at the conference meeting preceding the dedication: \"As the ruins of the Temples erected by the ancient inhabitants of this land today, testify of a God fearing people, so will the Salt Lake Temple stand for centuries to come as a grand monument of the faith, union, and unselfishness of the Saints of the Latter-days; and preach to the stranger who shall visit our beautiful valley in times to come, a sermon so powerful and convincing, that thousands will acknowledge the hand of the Lord in connection with the labor performed by the Saints, and lead them to embrace the truth.\"\nAges ago, in far off Judea, the Prophet Micah predicted that \"in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it...\" The dedication of the Salt Lake Temple marked the fulfillment of this ancient prophecy."

            "content": "The Angel Moroni\nAn Epic in Bronze Which Breathes the Very Essence of Revealed Religion\nElder Levi Edgar Young Member of the First Council of Seventy\nON the capstone of the center tower of the Salt Lake Temple stands Cyrus Dallin's heroic figure of the Angel Moroni. The theme of the rich bronze piece is crystallized in the words of John the Revelator: \"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\"\nThe statue of the Angel expresses a religious edification in keeping with the subject. In the open air, it raises its inspiring silhouette above the buildings of the street, and the details of the figure disappear in the impression of the whole. A spiritual energy emanates from the graceful body, as if it were flying through space. To really see the Angel, one must lose one's self in the power of the spirit. The whole lifts one from the earth to God.\nIn the creation of this majestic statue, Dallin's introspective soul found its greatest expression. Unless he were deeply religious he could not have created it. Its beauty is an expression of the profound theology of the Latter-day Saint Church teaching that \"the spirit and the body constitute the soul of man.\" The truth is nobly expressed as one of the teachings of the Book of Mormon, that nothing elevates the soul or raises it to adoration more than the striving for perfection, which unites man to God. Dallin believes himself to be more religious in creating beautiful harmonious human bodies, than by dreaming over the unsolved problems of life. To every creative artist comes \"the high moment of achievement,\" when the flame of genius burns most brightly. In the creating of the Angel Moroni, Dallin reached a \"high moment of achievement.\"\nTHE sculptor Dallin was born in Springville, Utah, in 1863, and when a small boy, he made models with mud, found in the swamps of his native town. When nineteen years old, he was sent to Boston to study art, and in 1883, he won a commission from the George Robert White fund for the creation of a statue of Paul Revere. When Dallin was chosen in 1884 to execute the statue, and plans were made to finance it, $25,000 to be raised by public subscription and $5,000 to be contributed by the city, a rival sculptor termed Dallin, then but twenty-two years of age, a \"cowboy from Utah\" and said his model depicted \"an impossible man on an impossible horse.\" The criticism served to blast the project, and the campaign to raise the $25,000 by subscription suffered a complete collapse. The\nPage 163\n164\nmoney was not raised and for nearly fifty years the project was officially dropped. Dallin sought various mayors of Boston through the years to induce them to appropriate funds for the statue, and a few years ago, he appealed to the Legislature, also without success, to erect the statue on the State House grounds. Four years ago, he presented his case to the five trustees of the city-owned George Robert White fund, who have the income of some $6,000,000 at their disposal for the erection of works of art. Mayor Tobin, the present mayor of Boston, with the other trustees of the fund, finally accepted the Dallin statue, and the end came to the sculptor's long fought battle. The statue was finally unveiled on Paul Revere Mall, in the North End of Boston in 1941. It is near the Revere historic home and the old North Church, where the lanterns were hung on that April night in 1775, when Paul Revere made his famous ride to Lexington and Concord.\nThe work of Dallin is best known from his statue of Lafayette which was presented to France by the American people. His \"Signal of Peace\" was exhibited at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, and it was presented to the City of Boston by prominent citizens of that city as a memorial to the American Indian.\nHis statue of Massasoit, the Indian chief who made a treaty of peace with the Pilgrim Fathers in 1621, stands at Plymouth Rock on the hill immediately above the place of landing of the Pilgrims in November 1620. His \"Medicine Man\" was shown at the International Exposition in Paris, 1900, which brought the artist world-wide fame. It was finally purchased for the Fairmont Park of Philadelphia, although the City of Vienna, in Austria, made offers for it. This was the first time that an American ever received an offer for statuary from Europeans. His \"Appeal to the Great Spirit\" stands in front of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. As you pass on the highway through his native town, Springville, you will see in the Public Square, Dallin's beautiful bust of his mother. It is a symbol of the mother nurturing the sons of men. The sweet dignity of her face, the tenderness of her mouth, bespeak in mute phrases her beautiful unselfishness.\nMr. Dallin returned to his old home in Springville in 1890, just three years previous to the finishing of the Salt Lake Temple. At the request of President Wilford Woodruff and others, he made the statue of the Angel, which was shipped from Boston. As he finished it, he exclaimed: \"This is my best, for it is my noblest subject.\"\nSTATUE OF ANGEL MORONI ATOP CENTER SPIRE OF SALT LAKE TEMPLE Cyrus E. Dallin, sculptor\nTHE ANGEL MORONI\n165"

            "content": "The Gold Watch\nMary Ek Knowles Third Prize, Relief Society Short Story Contest\nWHEN old Tom Edwards, night watchman for Bryson and Laird's department store, rang the station near the fur vault the first time, Ben Phillips was setting the time lock.\n\"How are things going, Tom?\" Ben called.\n\"Can't complain, Ben.\" Tom's voice lacked its usual friendliness. He couldn't explain why, but instinctively he mistrusted the manager of the Ready-To-Wear Department. The man was just too good to be true with his perfectly tailored clothes, his sleek dark hair, his easy smile, and his smooth flattering voice.\n\"How is your wife since the weather got cooler?\"\nThat question stopped Tom who was walking past as Ben locked the fur vault. His blue eyes clouded. \"Not so good,\" he said slowly. \"The least chilly breeze is enough to cripple her with rheumatism for days. Last winter she had to use a cane. I'm afraid she'll be worse this year.\"\nWorry gnawed at Tom's mind. Poor Annie! And with all her suffering, no whining, just a patient smile that fair tore your heart out.\n\"Why don't you take her to Florida, Tom?\" Ben Phillips pulled several brightly colored travel folders from his pocket and handed them to the watchman. \"Look through these. Warm southern climate and sunshine are what she needs.\"\nTom reached for the folders. \"Why, thanks, Ben,\" he said looking\nPage 166\nat the younger man with kinder eyes. Perhaps his instinct had been wrong. After all, he had nothing against Phillips. Mr. Bryson and Mr. Laird trusted him. Ben had been with the store only one year, yet it was he who locked the vault and carried a key to the store on his key ring.\nTom took the travel folders and sighed. \"Florida is the place for Annie, all right, Ben. But I haven't the means. There's been my son, David's, schooling, and Annie's doctor bills. No, Florida is out of my reach, Ben.\"\nBen frowned and twirled his key ring. \"You've been here twenty-five years. Seems to me, Tom, a prosperous store like this should do something special for you. Tell you what. I'm going to suggest to Mr. Laird that you be given a winter's vacation in Florida with all expenses paid for you and your wife.\"\nTom's senses reeled. A vacation in Florida with all expenses paid! Then the night watchman came down out of the clouds. The store owed him no such grand present! All these years it had given him steady work and a short vacation every year, with a turkey at Thanksgiving and a small bonus at Christmas.\n\"Thanks, Ben,\" he said, putting the folders in his back pocket, \"But the firm owes me nothing!\"\nWith a start he realized that he had halted on his rounds and there were some fifteen stations yet to ring in. He took a large gold watch from his\nTHE GOLD WATCH\nvest pocket and looked at it. \"I must be going. I'm a little late on my first round.\"\n\"That's an interesting watch,\" Ben remarked.\nLate or not, Tom had to tell the story. \"It was given to one of my folks by King George III way back in 1732.\" Tom Edwards displayed the black Roman numerals and slender gold hands of the timepiece that had ticked off so many hours of his sixty-eight years of life. He turned the watch over and pointed to the engraving. \"That's the Edwards coat of arms.\"\n\"An oak tree and a sword. Honor et Veritas,\" Ben read.\n\"Honor and Truth!\" Old Tom interpreted proudly. \"When my father handed me this he said, 'Son, what I'm passing on to you is more than just a gold watch. It is a name untouched by shame or dishonor!' And tomorrow,\" the watchman told the department manager, \"my son, David, gets this watch as a present when he graduates from medical school.\"\nTom Edwards was a short man, lean of body and face, yet as he stood there, his straightness, something in the way he held his well-shaped head with its mane of white hair, gave him height and dignity.\n\"Quite an heirloom!\" Ben said, \"but doesn't the loud ticking disturb you?\"\nTom chuckled as he replaced the watch in his vest pocket. \"So used to it, I never hear it! Thanks again for the folders.\" Turning quickly, Tom stumbled over a large suitcase, then righted himself and continued on his rounds. Later that night he studied the 167 MARY EK KNOWLES travel folders while he was eating his lunch. He sat on the wooden bench at the foot of the stairs in the basement of the store and slowly turned the rainbow-colored pages. Florida! His wistful eyes read every line of description, missed no detail of the vivid pictures. White beaches and green water... Palm trees against a blue sky... And sunshine, always sunshine! Annie could sit on the beach all day and feel the sunshine soak into her body. Reluctantly old Tom closed the folder and set it next to his lunch box. What was the good of wishing for the moon. He had better forget Florida. He looked at his watch, lam. Time to start his round of the store again. He creaked to his feet, hooked his gun belt tighter, 168 picked up his flashlight and started climbing the stairs. But the watchman could not forget Florida. The land of palm trees and sunshine continued to woo him. He finally gave up the brief struggle and lapsed into dreaming. He tried to picture the look on Annie's face if he should walk in and say, \"Pack your duds, girl, We're going to Florida for the winter!\"\" The brown eyes that suffering could not dim, would twinkle. \"Tom,\" she'd say, \"how you do run on! Florida, land sake!\" He would pick her up, then she was such a frail little thing \"I ain't foolin', Annie. We are a'goin',\" he'd say. \"Look at these folders.\" The watchman came to the top of the third flight of stairs. A sheepish grin overspread his face, and he pulled at his ear. He was a great one, mooning like a love-sick calf over Florida and his Annie until he clean passed the first and second floors. By golly, that was the first time in all the years he'd been night watchman that he hadn't registered at the stations on the main and second floors first! He was about to turn and walk down the stairs when a glow coming from the third floor fur vault attracted his attention. Tom's hand went to his gun and he tip-toed noiselessly toward the light. The partly open vault door revealed Ben Phillips. For a moment Tom stood and watched him, puzzled. Ben took a brown fur coat from a large suitcase, the very suitcase Tom had stumbled over, and placed it on a hanger in the vault along with dozens of other fur coats. Then he took a black fur coat from the suitcase and did the same thing. Next, he removed a shiny brown fur coat and a glistening black fur coat from their hangers in the vault, folded them carefully and placed them in the suitcase. Tom's hold on his gun tightened as he realized what Ben was doing. Swapping cheap furs for expensive ones! Tom pushed the vault door wide. \"Don't move, Phillips!\" The startled man straightened with a jerk, his eyes round with complete surprise. His face was a grayish white. 'Then his scared eyes appraised the watchman's shabby clothes... His gray hair. The color returned to Ben's cheeks. \"Hello, Tom,\" he said shakily. \"Just thought I'd better check over \"I saw what you did, Ben!\" Ben avoided the stony look in the old man's eyes. He took a billfold from his coat. He extracted four bills and held them out. \"Forget you ever saw me in here.\" Tom's figure stiffened and the muscles at the sides of his jaw twitched with fury. \"Don't be a sap, Edwards!\" Ben croaked. \"This is your chance to square things with the store. 'wentyfive years you've worked for Bryson and Laird. You don't live in a mansion on the hill as they do; your wife doesn't wear fur coats and diamonds; your son didn't have his education handed to him on a silver platter! \"I had everything _ perfectly planned. Listen\"' Ben's cracked voice hurried on. Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead as he explained his scheme for the perfect crime: the gaining of the complete confidence of the store's owners; THE GOLD WATCH checking on the night watchman's movements; and chatting earlier in the evening so that later, when the theft was discovered, Tom would testify that he had seen Ben locking the vault. But Ben had set the time clock for 1 a.m. And after switching the furs, he had planned to re-set it for the usual 8:30 in the morning so nobody would supect him. The travel folders! 'Tom no longer heard Ben's smooth voice. Even they had been given to make Tom more friendly toward the man he distrusted. Yes, it would have been the perfect crime if those same Florida folders hadn't made him walk as in a dream up to the third floor first, as he'd never done before. \"I can give you enough money to keep you for life!\" Ben pleaded. \"You could take Annie to Florida, Tom! Florida\" Ben Phillips hurried to paint on the watchman's mind a picture of Annie walking along the boardwalk with him, or sitting in a rocking chair crocheting, while the kind sun beat down on her thin body. A life in cozy auto courts with red-tiled roofs; checker tournaments and horse-pitching contests; and old cronies to swap yarns with. Tom's Adam's apple went up and 169 down in his thin neck. Florida would save Annie. No more cold winters for her! \"No one will ever find out,\" Ben argued desperately, \"Why not take the money?\" Why not? Then in the tense silence Tom heard the loud ticking of the gold watch over his heart. Honor and Truth! Honor and Truth! Honor and Truth! Louder and louder. Tom broke out into a cold sweat. Perhaps no one would ever find out about the theft. But he himself would know. \"What profiteth a \" Lose his good name. Man... Why pride in a good name was the - flesh and blood of a man, the strength of his bones. It was the set of his head, the firm confident tread of his feet. It was long nights of untroubled sleep and looking at his fellowman in the eye without flinching. And he had almost thrown that away! With one swift movement Tom slammed the vault door. The lock clicked. Then he ran to the office to telephone the police. Tomorrow Thomas Edwards would give his son, David, a gold watch, and with it a priceless heritage. CONTENTMENT Fern Ostler Old rambling farmhouse 'mid great trees, Scent of violets, a gentle breeze, Fields of grain, newly plowed earth Contentment there of priceless worth. On That First Morning Vesta P. Crawford \"And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.\"St. Mark 16:2. Where Jesus had been laid, there came, on a morning long ago, a great brightness. The glory of this light was seen by the three Marys and by others of them who loved the Lord. In the long centuries since that day the promise of life eternal has glowed with rainbow splendor against the darkness of the world. 'This promise has become the recurrent message of springtime, the everlasting strength of hope and courage. Through all the span of time since that first resurrection, millions of people have turned to the Holy Bible to renew the brightness of Easter morning. \"He is not here: for he is risen\"  so came the testament of the angel nearly two thousand years ago. So comes the message down the ages for people in every land to see the beacon light. For those who may have forgotten that the stone was rolled away, there is a hallowed surety in the simple words of the gospel narratives. John and Mark, Luke and Matthewthey tell the Easter story, each in his own way, each after the interpretation of -his own heart, as the life of the Savior had inspired him. F ROM the darkness of the tomb CLEARLY etched with vivid detail is the story told by John. He explains his purpose in words that have long been remembered: \"... That ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that Page 170 believing ye might have life through his name.\" John speaks of a garden that was near Calvary, and in that garden there was a new sepulchre. In this tomb the followers of Jesus laid His body. Even before it was light on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came into the garden and approached the tomb. The stone had been rolled away. \"Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.\" The disciples hurried to the tomb and found it empty. \"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.\" \"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping.\" 'Then she looked into the tomb and saw two angels sitting where Jesus had lain. The angels said unto Mary Magdalene \"Woman, why weepest thou?\" And she told them that they had taken away her Lord and she did not know where they had laid Him. Suddenly she saw Jesus standing near her, but at first she did not recognize Him. He spoke her name \"Mary!\" And she knew that the Savior had risen from the dead. Light glowed upon the dark stones and the springtime of hope came into the ON THAT FIRST MORNING garden. \"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord....\" In this, our time, when the very foundations of the earth are shaken, and the faith of many of us is tested by tragedy, is it not a quiet and precious thing to take a few moments from the rush of time to contemplate the testament of John? Now is a time for remembering that which has been written for our comfort and our surety. MARK tells the story of Christ's ministry in a series of word pictures etched with faith and understanding, etched with a splendor that has instructed the generations who have believed in the message of Easter. Mark has limned with graphic description an eternal picture of the resurrection. It is Mark who so beautifully portrays the coming of Joseph of Arimathaea, \"an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God\"how Joseph came to Calvary and took the body of Jesus and prepared it for burial. In a tomb hewn out of a rock Joseph laid his friend with love and care. Mark describes the coming of the Marys and the splendor of the angel's message... \"Be not affrighted:... He is risen; he is not here:\" - The appearance of Jesus to eleven of his disciples is presented in Mark's strong, direct words, and the command of Jesus is written... \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" And Jesus told his followers that they should \"speak with new tongues.\" It is, as Mark implies, the duty and the pleasure of those who believe the gospel 171 to spread the message of Easter to the far places of the world. Each gospel narrator tells with great emphasis that part of the story which most appeals to him, which seems the most inspiring, the most enduring. UKE, called \"the physician,\" was the companion of Paul on his second missionary journey, and it is he who stresses in his gospel the message of good news to all nations. \"It seemed good to me also,\" Luke said, \"having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee... That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.\" Every word of Luke's narrative is imbued with strength and meaning, as if he were writing upon granite, words to last throughout the coming ages, words to comfort the nations down along the path of history. Luke says that when the women saw the angels in shining garments standing against the dark rocks of the sepulchre, they were afraid and bowed their faces. In the solemnity of the garden with bleak Calvary rising up beyond the place, the angels spoke a message of eternal life: \"Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee.\"\nIt is Luke who gives the most vivid picture of the wonderful walk by evening unto a town called Emmaus. This is the event hallowed by many artists who have been inspired by this story of comfort at eventide. Hoffman, the great painter of the life of Christ, and many lesser artists\n172\nas well, portray this happening with spiritual insight, divining the inner glory of the farewell words of Jesus. The story of that walk along a path that led from Jerusalem to Emmaus is well remembered by all who have read the scriptural text. Two of the disciples walked by evening to this village, \"And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.\"\nThis significant event of the first Easter has been expressed in poetry:\nAt eventide when flowers closed And all the world was still, Two of them who loved the Lord Walked slowly up the hill; Beyond them in the valley They heard the Marys weep The path unto Emmaus town Was stony clad and steep; Then soundless was the silver night, No leaf stirred on its stem, Yet suddenly they heard a voice And Jesus walked with them.\nThe three travelers reached the village, but Jesus \"made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.\"\nFrom these words has come the great Christian hymn, \"Abide With Me.\"\nAbide with me! Fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!\nTHE words of Matthew glow with lasting simplicity. He alone of all the gospel writers tells how the stone was rolled away, how light came from darkness, the details of that first Easter. \"... As it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.\"\nSuch is the story of Easter as the disciples who lived in that far day have testified. In these precious words there is no faltering, no doubt, and no embellishment. In these words there is only simplicity, truth, and the promise of eternal life. No troubled years are long enough to dim the splendor of the message. Steadfast as spring, the promise returns and abides with us."

Hamer Reiser Second Assistant General Superintendent\nTHE Sunday Schools of the Church are immeasurably benefited by the action of the First Presidency in appointing Milton Bennion to be general superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union.\nMilton Bennion as a personality, apart from the honors and distinction he has earned, is an inspirational, faith-stimulating captain. I have known him intimately for twenty-five years. Never once have I known him to ask or advise anyone to do anything which he would not do himself. One takes from such a person a strong sense of confidence and courage born of rightness and justness. He is the personification of unselfishness and of thoughtfulness for the welfare of others. His selflessness is the essence of his rich spirituality. In fact, he thinks and lives so much for others that he has forgotten himself into greatness.\nHe was vice-president of the University of Utah, Dean of the School of Education, and Professor of Philosophy and Education when he retired from the University. In recognition of his eminence and devotion, the University, in 1931, conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Education. Long before this time he had earned recognition for scholarship with degrees from the University of Utah and Columbia, and he had distinguished himself in graduate study at Wisconsin and California.\nMost brilliant among the jewels which make his life rich and\nMILTON BENNION\nbeautiful are his family and his family life. His wife, Cora Lindsay Bennion, was for years a devoted and beloved member of the General Board of the Relief Society. They have reared a wonderful family of children.\nHis experience in the service of the Church is wide and varied, and extends back into his early youth. As a missionary in New Zealand, an officer in priesthood quorums, teacher and executive in ward, stake, and general Sunday School work he has always given of his best effort. His ideas and principles are sound and forward-looking. His plans for the Sunday Schools are progressive.

The early Mormon people were deprived for years of the daily strength that the thrill and comfort of home normally provides. Every time they were compelled to move to a new location, the idea of a safe home became more of an ambition, a goal in their lives, the symbol of all they hoped for.\nThe desperate journey across the plains to establish themselves in the mountains might easily have failed, had not the bitter years of persecution in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinoisyears during which the Saints were seeking freedom of worshipfocused the attention of the people upon the true value of a home, and the simple things of life. Finally when they migrated to Utah, \"willingly, because they had to,\" the homes they established became the theme of their songs, and the treasures of their hearts.\nTen, twenty, thirty years passed. The happiness and prosperity that pursue those who persistently follow a simple pattern of a full life devoid of useless meandering, had come to many Mormon communities. Then came the call for certain of these families, or their sons and daughters, to leave the well-earned fruits of their faith and labor, and cross the Great River to form new settlements in Arizona.\nArizona was a land far away, very far from \"Zion.\" It was a weird and\nPage 174\nstrange land, described in terms that retained much of the imagery of Indian speech or terms flavored by the remembrance of the hectic marches, the endurance, and sacrifices of the members of the Mormon Battalion. It was a land of vast deserts, plateaux upon which Indians danced with rattlesnakes in their mouths, rattlesnakes that when liberated, served as messengers to their gods. It was a land of contradictions and conflicting elements: majestic mountains, bottomless canyons, miles of flat country; stifling heat, bitter cold; prickly pears and cacti, superb lilies of the desert; virgin forests, treeless expanses; no water, destructive floods. And it was not home!\nThose who were called to make this journey had no prophet of their faith to lead them. Their friends and loved ones did not plan to follow them. Few, if any, expected to better their lot. Utah was Zion, Utah was home, and they but crusaders on a life-time mission to expand the borders of their homes in the mountains. Another generation perhaps, or new converts to the faith, might some day need this land and the opportunity which would be created through their years of pioneering; but the Utah streams and fields, the orchards and the flocks of sheep, the cattle, the temples, built and being built, the schools and churches, their friends and memories, belonged to them, were part of them. Now they were asked to leave all this, and start over again.\nThe hopes and wishes of the\nCROSSING THE RIVER INTO ARIZONA\n175\nTOP: VIEW OF ST. JOHNS, ARIZONA, ABOUT 1887 BOTTOM: RECENT VIEW OF ST. JOHNS, ARIZONA\nLatter-day Saints in Utah had found a completeness in a life pattern of working, going to school, going on a mission, falling in love, marrying, building a home, and having children. It was a good pattern, complete, stable, satisfying, American! Only a very devout faith in a leadership that had seen them through many difficulties and that had succeeded despite the dire predictions of the so-called \"great minds\" of the nation, made obedience to this call to Arizona tolerable.\nArizona lay \"across the river,\" across the deepest abyss in all America. But the foreboding depth of that great canyon was no deeper than the psychological gulf that separated \"a life in Zion\" from \"going forth to conquer the land of desolation.\"\nTHE crossing of the river was the first great hazard for these pioneers. It was a warning of other dangers yet to come. It was not unlike a special kind of baptism that bound those who made this journey into an understanding oneness. They became part of the legends of those indefatigable missionaries and scouts who for several years had been sent out in advance by the church authorities. These pioneers thus brought reality to the hopes and sacrifices of as courageous a group of men as\n176\never walked. They wrote the final chapter in one book, the saga of the Mormon scouts, and the first chapter in a new volume, the story of the Arizona pioneers.\nThe road from Kanab lead across a barren expanse into the depths of the Kaibab forest, and then the road lead down, down, and down. Trees were left behind, jutting sandstone cliffs loomed higher and higher and came closer and closer. Eerie shadows added to the suggestion of descending into a Stygian pit. For the women it was an experience that made them hold tightly to the \"call\" and the priesthood of the men who led the way.\nThe crossing of the muddy river was made on a ferryboat. Below them the roar of the Colorado (Spanish for red), turning white in the turmoil of dropping down between towering cliffs, reverberated back upon their ears. Emotions could not remain petty in such a setting. Women who made the crossing seemed set apart, marked with a calm faith and tender strength, and strangely free from trivialities and snobbishness. It was a time of self-renunciation that brought a new sense of trust. They had said goodby to kindred and home, with its comforts, schools, and doctors. There was no turning back. They had crossed a great river. They had now only their faith, their husbands, and their God.\nSafely over the river, other hazards loomed. The road to the plateau to the east and south was treacherous. A rock set loose tumbled noisily down toward the white waters far below. If a wheel should break, a team become frightened? To glance aside, ahead, or backward was\nto suffer a chill of fear or discouragement. This road seemed to be the path of Christian in Pilgrim's Progress become reality. Horses and men took one step forward, hoping for the best. Had they known it, this was to become the symbol of their life in Arizona.\nWhen the summit was reached, as far as the eye could see there stretched out a land as barren as ever faced a traveler. Far to the south, more like a mirage than a fact, there seemed to be hills that might hold some promise. In the evening, when the camp fires were built, one could see, miles across the canyon, the camp fires of the friends who had accompanied them to the river, and were now climbing back toward House Rock and Kanab. And so, for two or three nights the camp fires of those returning to Zion and those who were leaving it seemed to signal a note of affection and love, straight across a canyon that defied a crossing.\nTHE Arizona pioneers, from north to south, gave all their strength and zest to the endless work they had undertaken. They settled along Silver Creek, in bad weather some three or four weeks' journey by team to the south and east, founding Snowflake; some built homes along the Little Colorado River from Round Valley and St. Johns down to St. Joseph and Sunset, now known as the abandoned colony; while others continued along the Gila River and made Thatcher the leading Mormon town, or went into the fertile valley of the Salt River where Mesa became Mormon headquarters. (Many of the settlers in Mesa came\nCROSSING THE RIVER INTO ARIZONA\n177\nTOP: FIRST L. D. S. CHURCH, ST. JOHNS, ARIZONA, 1883 BOTTOM: L. D. S. CHAPEL, ST. JOHNS, ARIZONA, 1939\nfrom Bear River, north of Salt Lake City.)\nIn varying degrees all the colonies experienced real troubles: Indian uprisings, most serious in the Gila Valley; extreme anti-Mormon persecutions in St. Johns; and excessive heat in the Salt River and Gila Valleys. All sections were subject to alternating droughts and floods. Most of the colonies had dams washed away. St. Joseph built eight before the ninth one withstood the tricky variables of soil, heat, and flood. Woodruff had an even worse record. St. Johns' dam troubles were tragic for lives were lost, and the savings and efforts of years carried away by the swirling waters.\nBut usually there was enough food, although one winter (1879-80) many people lived mostly on barley-meal ground in small hand mills. Another year, in the early eighties, President John Taylor had a carload of flour sent to the St. Johns colony. In addition to a scarcity of irrigation water in St. Johns, it was also a problem to obtain water for use in the houses or to drink. At first the wells were good, but the well water later turned brackish, and so drinking water had to be hauled in from wells a few miles away at a cost of five cents a bucket. Washings were done in ditch water after it had been allowed to settle in forty-gallon barrels that stood by the garden ditch. Baths\n178\nwere taken in well water and rain water was caught and saved, or snow was melted for special washing and shampooing, so mothers kept their families well and clean with a variety of waters!\nIn the St. Johns country our colonization was definitely resented by Mexican leaders and \"cattle barons\" who were there when our people came. A strong anti-Mormon feeling was fanned into a bright flame by a few men. The town newspaper and other records reveal that Mormon leaders were refused the ballot, and it was repeatedly advocated that they be driven out or killed. The women were slandered and vilified in terms calculated to start a war.\nI recall clearly the \"lot-jumping episode\" in St. Johns. I stood on a chair between mother and Aunt Ida and watched our men tearing down a fence that other men were trying to build. I saw a big team hauling a little shanty toward Brother Babbit's lot which the \"strangers\" planned to \"jump.\" A man tried to shoot the team. Twice the gun clicked but it did not fire. A little later it was learned that the firing of that gun was to have been the signal for a group of men who had been specially armed for the occasion, to start a war of extermination of the Mormon men. I remember well how mother and Aunt Ida knelt in prayer, each in turn supplicating God that this trouble and hate might pass away without death or destruction coming into our homes.\nThere came a time when Mormon leaders living in plural marriage were indicted by the courts. By great sacrifice funds were raised for their defense.\nAt a quarterly conference in St. Johns, Apostle Brigham Young called on the brethren in the northern towns to fast and attend a prayer meeting to pray for their enemies. Each of the six leaders of the \"St. Johns' Ring\" were remembered before the Lord and were placed in His hands. Some of the brethren were convicted by the courts and taken from their families to be sent to jail. A few fled to Mexico. In two or three years those who had been imprisoned were home again and within that time a strange fate had overtaken the six leaders of the persecution. Five of the six men met death suddenly and violently under circumstances that convinced many of their close friends that unusual accidents and \"bolts from the blue,\" which could never have been fabricated by man, had a strange and uncanny way of doing away with anti-Mormons. The sixth member of the \"Ring\" had become a true friend of the Mormon people and remained so to the end of his long and honored life.\nBY the nineties a new generation began to play its part. Young couples began to build new homes, and rear families to whom Arizona was the only home. Zion had increased her borders. The communities in Arizona boasted schools, churches, stores, and assets that marked them as a permanent part of the ever-widening regions being made habitable by Mormon endurance and hard work. To the new pattern of courage and sacrifice, faith and trust which they had been forced to de-\n(Continued on page 220)"

            "content": "Tomorrow's Cup\nAnna Prince Redd\nCHAPTER I\nIT was a golden day at El Toro, the first of a delayed spring. Janet stood at the window, her thoughts as far from the day as this Indian trading post home of hers was from civilization. The sun tinted her eyelids and glowed warm against her face. But, though she was nerve-cold, she pushed its small comfort aside and gazed again, rebelliously, into the blue-gold distance. Distance that piled up and up into ships and spires and temples in the Monument Valley; into mountains a hundred miles away, yet vividly near and distinct in the sunlight. Not a living thing in sight. Not a sound to echo against the cliffs.\n\"Is this all there is for me?\" she questioned desperately. \"Thisawful emptiness?\"\nHer hands gripped the stone window ledge and her eyes swam with tears. Why had she ever thought she could be happy in such a place? Even with a husband as dashing and satisfying as Paul it was unendurable. How could a country so vast close in on one so? For three years she had fought it with all her strength, yet it had yielded not an inch. If only she hadn't met Paul and fallen in love with him! It had seemed so unimportant, then, where she would live. She'd reasoned that husbands could be lured away later. Paul was brilliant, educated, and resourceful; he could make his way in any country. It had taken so little to quiet her fears. Now they confronted her with terrifying insistence.\n\"Why do I fear it so?\" she cried, knowing as always that there was no one to hear. Her father loved every foot of it. Every mound, every cliff, every ancient dwelling. They only frightened her. To him they were open books of the past; to her they were walls of a prison. She wished she'd never listened to his glowing tales, then she'd never have come to this country at all. She'd have stayed in Washington, D. C. Where she belonged. She'd have stayed and married a nice respectable congressman, or someone, and not have had a thing to worry about.\nSUMMER after summer her father had brought back wonderful tales. Following each archeological expedition he'd say: \"Janet, I must take you with me next time,\" until he'd finally won out. She'd thrown prudence aside, left Washington in \"Cherry Tree Time\"andand longed for it ever since! She had felt so sure of herself there in Washingtonwith Paul as their guest, the center of attraction, telling his tall tales of grandeur and of the empire he and Janet meant to build upsure of Paul. Once they were married it would be easy to make him see that he belonged in her sphere. And so she had gone to San Juan.\nNow, after three years, she was no nearer leaving it than on the day she had entered it.\n\"Oh, what's the use!\" she cried, her thoughts suddenly becoming intolerable. \"Paul is gone. Juanee is gone. Only Taos and I remain, to\nPage 179\n180\nwait and wait.\" The Indian womanfaithful as a shadowwould have been some company. But she had gone, leaving Janet in the blackest mood she'd ever experienced. If there was a single human sound she could stand it. If, even, the dog would wake up and bark. But Taos was asleep in the sun, like everything else, and oblivious to her misery.\n\"Taos,\" she spoke his name tentatively. \"Taos, wake up.\"\nTaos yawned, stretched, cocked a brown ear and opened one eye, but saw nothing to get excited about.\n\"See? I may as well be in the Sahara Desert!\"\nWhy had she let Juanee go back to camp? She, at least, would have grunted when spoken to. Juanee's man had gone to the spring roundup with Paul, and Juanee was homesick for her mother's hogan, so she had gone home. Well, that was something Janet could understand. She was homesick too. Not only homesick for Paullife without him was intolerablebut homesick for her home. Sick for the sight of green things in the spring. Not just desert greensharply defined against red rocks that got redder and hotter with every hour of sunbut rain and lawn green. Lawns banked with sunlight on the Potomac; and the white pillars of homes. Water! Streaming from faucets, instead of standing stagnant, in wooden barrels, or in gritty pockets in the rocks. Water to swim in. Water to waste! Here, in the desert, the sand dyed and stained; swirled and drifted with the wind. Never an hour the same, until you wearied of looking at it. And the\nfirst thing you knew you began to drift with it, shriveling up and rolling along until you struck a snag; there you clung until a stronger force dislodged you and sent you reeling again. Nowhere. Everywhere. Looking for water!\nJANET sighed and turned back into the spacious living room. There at least was familiarity, if not contentment. Her own books and pictures; her own chairs. Outside, the more you looked the more unfamiliar things became. Every day you saw something for the first time and it wearied you. Inside, a fire smouldered; for, though spring was well on its way, the air from the river came in damp and cold. Cold and withholding, like the country it traversed yet failed to nourish. It was this riverthe San Juanthat Janet hated more than all the rest.\nThe house itself was a luxurious den of a place, low and inviting. Broad windows, framing sage and trust flooded the room with light. Chairs stood beside the fireplace, or were placed where they would lure one to the windows; floors, rubbed to show the grain, stained to enhance the knots of pine, gleamed in the firelight. The rooms wandered comfortably in and out of each other, just as El Toro wandered among its outer buildingsthe store, the warehouses, the barns, and the corral. These quarreled for an importance they could never achieve. Only El Toroagainst a fifty-foot cliff flaming at noon, purpling to shadows at nightcould claim that. And sometimes, in the heat, the cliff alone, caught the eye. Isolated from the world by sand, by canyons, by dis-\nTOMORROW'S CUP\ntance, and by God's design, man's puny contrivances faded into insignificanceto glow again, as a flicker of candlelight in the darkness following the lurid day.\nJanet appraised the house with trained eyes; it was just as it should be, fitting into its surroundings as a hand into a long-used glove. Hate the outside as she would, this was home and she'd hate to leave it. She looked guiltily around as if her thought had been overheard. It was the first time she had expressed it openly to herself; and daring to think it gave her strength. She would endure this a few months longer because she would not let it dwarf her. But now she had an incentive stronger than herself. An incentive that even Paul would recognize. She would not bring a child up in such a place. When Paul knew she was going to have a baby, then, of course, he'd know they would have to leave El Toro.\nA FLARE of wind brought an acrid odor to Janet's nostrils. She wrinkled her nose against it from force of habit and went to the door to look out. All the willow and campfire smells in the world, all the odors of wet wool and hair, were baled into the baskets and blankets and hides that were piled to the ceilings in El Toro's warehouse. Janet surveyed them disdainfully. All this represented the dollars Paul was daily pouring into the banks. It was so ridiculously easy to make money here where there was nothing to spend it for! Paul should be matching wits with his equals, not with savages in a savage country.\nAll at once Taos began to bark as if he couldn't contain himself. The\n181\nsound was so sudden that Janet almost screamed. She spoke to him sharply, but he refused to be quieted. She had never seen him act like that except at Paul's approach, and Paul was fifty miles away. He and all the other men on the desert, whites and Indians alike, were at the roundup. There was no need to even keep the store open for there was no one to buy. Yet Taos was announcing someone. It wasn't a warning bark; it was more a puzzled, uneasy delight.\nSuddenly there came a sliding, scrambling sound against the cliff back of the house. Taos dashed for it. Janet followed cautiously. When she reached the corner of the house there was Paul, scruffing Taos with both hands and warding off the dog's too affectionate tongue, stretching his neck to keep his face out of reach, turning laughingly from side to side, enjoying the dog's greeting.\n\"Paul!\" Janet could hardly speak from surprise.\n\"Janet!\" Paul threw Taos from him and came to Janet with outstretched arms. \"Blame the dog anyway!\" he laughed. \"I nearly break my neck trying to surprise you and he yelps out the whole story!\"\n\"Paul, you scared me. How did youYou didn't slide down that cliff?\"\nEven before she asked the question, Janet had taken in the significance of the dangling rope that hung suspended from the top of the cliff nearly down to Paul's head.\n\"Sure I slid down the cliff,\" Paul answered. \"Slid down like a thief. A man has to drop out of the skies to surprise you. You're so calm and undisturbable.\"\n182\nJanet looked away. It was hard to meet Paul's frank, admiring eyes. Calm! Undisturbable! Only a minute ago, alone, afraid, she had wanted to rock the desert out of its eternal complacency. Now, with Paul home again, El Toro was a wonderful place. She held Paul off to look at him. Brown and lean, he was the essence of masculine attraction. He had the tenderest eyes and the most challenging grin in the world. But, as always, his hold over her was a little annoying. She couldn't resist a good natured jibe.\n\"The roundup, Paul?\" she said. \"You didn't, by any chance, find that they could get along without you?\"\n\"Without me? I'll say they couldn't! Any more than I could get along without you.\"\n\"You win by sheer gallantry! Why, then, are you home? Two full weeks ahead of time.\"\n\"I came for you.\"\n\"Me?\" Janet's monosyllable was equal to Juanee's clipped speech.\n\"Yah. Me come. Mountains. Steal squaw. No come back one week. Heap like um squaw. All time lonesome\"\n\"Paul, stop talking Navajo and tell me why you're home. Is anything wrong?\"\n\"Plenty. I lost some cows on the mesa. That means they'll have to get along without their top hand for one whole week.\"\n\"The cows?\"\n\"Never mind the cows, we're going to camp right among them. It's the Whackies I'm talking about. You'll love camping for a week.\"\n\"But Paul\"\n\"Don't object, girl. Juanee is on her way home to look after the place.\"\nJanet wasn't thinking of the place, but of herself. Would horseback riding be good for her? For the baby?\nSHE slipped out of Paul's arms. Taos had waited for that and he bounded into them. Paul shoved him aside with his boot.\n\"You're as big a nuisance as a kid,\" he grinned. \"Darned if you're not!\"\nJanet looked at him quickly, suspiciously. Did Paul know already? Evidently not, for he was blissfully launching into plans for the camping trip. Janet sighed with relief. Paul was such a whirlwind.\n\"Get some grub together, Jan,\" he said affectionately. \"We've got to pull our stuff up the cliff with the rope. I'll get some panniers from the store. I couldn't take time to go twenty miles around to the road so I just slid down.\" His jaw fell. \"And, my north star, how'm I going to get you up!\"\n\"Through the Devil's Corridor, silly. Had you forgotten that?\"\nPaul scratched his head reflectively. \"I've not thought of that crack in more than a year. That's the most prideful thing at El Toro.\"\n\"You told me so the day you brought me here.\" Janet looked at him queerly. \"And I thought I'd be the most prideful thing at El Toro.\"\n\"Girl, sometimes I think you don't like El Toro!\"\nPaul's answer startled Janet with its perception. She wanted to say she wished she didn't, but the words wouldn't come. You could think and think when you were alone, but\nTOMORROW'S CUP\nyou didn't speak your thoughts to Paul Morgan. At least not the way you thought them. Yet, sometime, that, or something else, had to be said. Paul must be made to understand that you couldn't bring up a child a million miles from nowhere.\nPaul sensed her withdrawal. \"I'll get the panniers from the store,\" he said briefly. \"Sure you want to come along?\"\n\"Of course I do.\" Janet laughed shakily, and Paul grinned his relief.\nIN a few minutes he was back from the store with the panniers. \"I'll have to go back and empty the mouse traps and fix up a window shade that has come loose. Everything in the store will fade. Indians don't like pale colors. You pack while I'm doing it. Huh?\"\nJanet nodded. \"Work fast; we'll have to get up through the Corridor before dark. That crack terrifies me.\"\n\"Nothing scares you, Jan. You're enough of a mustang for that. And do I like you! Any mail?\"\n\"Nothing important.\" Janet's voice was uncertain. \"It'sIt's on your desk, Paul.\"\nAs soon as Paul was out of sight she sat down weakly. Not afraid! \"Paul, you blind idiot, can't you see that I sleep with fear at my back?\"\nShe got up and examined the panniers. One in each hand she weighed their possibilities. Queer things; she'd never packed one of them but she supposed she could do it. She got the food, bedding, and dishes together and stacked them on the porch, hoping Paul would be back in time to put them in the big canvas bags. But he was still in the store so she went to work on them herself,\n183\nputting things in in the order they would be needed. Lunch cloths, dish towels, sheets, she simply couldn't sleep in itchy old blankets, and her personal things for one side. Canned goods, bake oven, frying pan for the other. There, it was done. Paul would be pleased. He hated fussing over details. He liked large scale operations; that was the reason they were constantly involved in things that threatened to swamp them. Still, Paul usually won out, kept ahead of the game. She looked up, flushed and anxious to be off. Now she could get dressed. Why didn't Paul come?\nHALF an hour later, slim legs encased in riding pants, a soft shirt under her jacket, Janet stood waiting. Still no Paul. The sun was getting low. Why didn't he hurry? She ran along the board walk to the store, expecting to see Paul going about locking up. What she saw was his big boots sticking up above his desk, his nice long frame slanted back into his office chair. He was sound asleep!\nFor a second she was angry. How like a man! Then she saw the tired sag of his whole body. He looked years older, unmasked that way in sleep. She'd heard cowboys say that they were in for a couple of weeks in the saddle, but she hadn't taken it literally. Paul must not have slept for days.\n\"Paul! Paul, wake up!\" Janet touched his rough cheek gently.\nPaul didn't move, and she hadn't the heart to call again. She sat down on a sack of wool, regardless of her riding suit, and watched him sleep.\n184\nTruly it was a process. How could anyone rest, and work at it so hard? In another minute she was giggling. He looked so funny! A great snore shook Paul from stem to stern; he shuddered and opened his eyes, still clogged with sleep. Janet laughed again.\n\"Paul, you big goof!\"\nPaul sighed regretfully. \"For Pete's sake I've been asleep.\"\n\"It's a good thing I didn't see you for the first time while you were asleep, or you'd have been a bachelor yet. Unless\"\n\"Unless what?\" Paul winked the sleep out of his brain.\n\"Unless you'd married someone else.\"\n\"Who? Me?\" That was one of the reasons she tortured herself hourly by staying in a place she hatedhis utter disbelief that he could ever have married anyone else. In spite of the torment it made being together worth while.\n\"I'm a mug to go to sleep, wasting time that I could spend with you!\" He kissed her and they dashed for the house.\n\"I have the panniers all packed, Paul.\"\n\"Fine! Save a lot of time.\" Paul surveyed the panniers. He took one in each hand, balanced one, then the other, testing their weight. \"Good night!\" The expression was loaded with amazement.\nWithout bothering to explain, he began pulling everything out of the bags, mixing them up in his own waycanned goods here, there, and everywhere. It seemed to Janet that he was deliberately mussing things up, putting her carefully ironed towels and lunch cloths inside bake ovens; knives and forks in frying pans; everything of her own poked in where nothing else seemed to fit.\nSuddenly she was consumed with anger. Never in her life had she seen such ruthless disregard. She turned and went to the water barrel bolted to a juniper tree at the corner of the house. Taos came and licked her hand. She patted his head absently.\n\"Why did he act that way, Taos? I wish I'd never seen this place!\"\n(To be continued)"

Lip service and good will alone will not suffice. It is the woman's auxiliary of the Church, and as such, it is the proper channel through which women members of the Church serve. Its greatest strength lies in the fact that direction and guidance have ever been given it by the Priesthood of God. The general presidency of the Relief Society, who with the other members of the General Board plan the work of Relief Society, is directed by the presidency of the\nPage 186\nChurch; the Relief Society stake presidencies, who with their Boards carry on the work in the stakes, are directed by the stake presidencies; the ward Relief Society officers, who are responsible for carrying on the work in the wards, are directed by the bishoprics; and all these Relief Society officers are chosen by the Priesthood, and are responsible to them. Those sisters so chosen may rightly feel that they have been called to their positions of responsibility by inspiration, and that their offerings have been accepted of the Lord, just as the Prophet Joseph affirmed to that original small group of women desirous of banding together to further the work on the temple, that the Lord had accepted their offering and that He had something better for them than a written constitution. As we all know the Relief Society was the organization that the Lord had for His faithful daughters.\nWhen we recall the early beginnings of the Society, the instructions, and promises made to its members which continue in force today, it is evident that the allegiance of each sister in the Church should be wholeheartedly behind the Relief Society. With the present outlook on affairs in the world and the picture that has been given us by our leaders of the sorrows and afflictions which lie in the future, it is a time when the women of the Church should devote all possible energies to building up the Relief Society and helping to carry on its work. The program of the\nEDITORIAL\norganization is constantly expanding not only to provide for the increased needs of the organization itself and the Church Welfare Program, but also to aid the humanitarian efforts of the Red Cross, to sew in the interest of the war effort, to help supply certain services for hospitals, and other services called for in wartime. Further obligations may face us any day.\nThe blessings which the Lord pours out on His daughters serving in this Church auxiliary are inexpressible. Through attendance at meetings each woman is strengthened and comforted by the beautiful spirit that is present. Expressions of gratitude and appreciation are spoken which serve as strong cords to bind the members of Relief Society into a close circle of sisterly love and devotion. Burdens are lightened through the performance of duties for others. Even aside from the intellectual benefits, and they are numerous, which Relief Society members\n187\nreceive, active membership in the Society is vital for the spiritual blessings which are experienced from participation in the organization, for the Lord looks with favor upon His daughters who love and serve Him, and who unselfishly work for the joy of others.\nLet us as sisters in Zion dedicate ourselves anew to the work we have been called upon to perform. May we prove ourselves as worthy as our dear sisters of long ago, who eagerly seized the opportunity presented to them by the Prophet Joseph Smith and who earned the promised reward: \"You are now placed in a situation in which you can act according to those sympathies which God has planted in your bosoms. If you live up to these principles how great and glorious will be your reward in the celestial kingdom! If you live up to your privileges, the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates.\"\nM. C. S."

In speaking of the Salt Lake Temple, Brigham Young once said:\nI want this temple that we are now building to the name of our God, to stand for all time to come as a monument of the industry, faithfulness, faith, and integrity of the Latter-day Saints who were driven into the mountains.\nDuring the fifty years since the dedication of this sacred edifice, many of the women of the Church have labored long and earnestly in this temple for themselves and their dead. The best way to express our feelings to the Lord on the great privileges and blessings which are ours this day in being permitted to enter temples and receive endowments therein is to show forth an increase of diligence and works in laboring in our temples."

The General Board regrets to announce that due to delay in annual\nNOTES TO THE FIELD\nreport forms with which Magazine subscription report forms must be compared, the publication of the Magazine honor roll will be delayed until May.\nRelief Society officers and Magazine representatives are to be commended upon their efforts during the past year in the interest of the Magazine. The present circulation is the largest in the history of the periodical. This is particularly gratifying at a time when the Magazine is so\n189\ngreatly needed by Latter-day Saint women. The General Board appreciates the many demands now made upon the time and ability of women and acknowledges with gratitude the loyal service of those who have secured the present large number of Magazine subscriptions.\nRelief Society women will await with interest the publication of the honor roll, and those whose names appear on this roll may feel justly proud.\nRelief Society Broadcast, March 14, 1943\nTHROUGH courtesy of the Church Radio Committee the time of the regular Sunday evening hour of the Church on March 14, 1943, from 9:15 to 9:45 P. M. M. W. T. Over radio station KSL is being given over to the use of the Relief Society in recognition of its 101st birthday which falls on March 17, 1943. President Amy Brown Lyman will be the speaker; and music for the program will be under the direction of Dr. Florence Jepperson Madsen, member of the Relief Society General Board.\n1943 Red Cross War Fund Campaign\nTHE Relief Society General Board calls to the attention of Relief Society women the 1943 Red Cross War Fund Campaign which is now underway, and recommends that announcement of this campaign be made in Relief Society meetings and that Relief Society members, as individuals, be urged to contribute liberally to this worthy cause. Funds for the humanitarian work of the Red Cross are more urgently needed this year than ever before, and the campaign merits the support of every individual who is earning. Solicitations for funds began March 1, 1943.\nThe policy of the General Board with respect to Relief Society participation in Red Cross work remains the same as stated in Blue Bulletin No. 24, as follows:\n\"The policy of the General Board, approved by the First Presidency, with respect to Red Cross calls for funds is to give publicity to them and to encourage members of the Relief Society to respond to such calls, as individuals. This means that Relief Society would not be used as an agency for the actual collection of funds.\n\"Contributions to the Red Cross should not be made by Relief Society organizations as such, from the funds of the organization. It is not expected that one relief organization should contribute to another from the funds collected for its own particular work.\"\nThe letter sent to ward bishoprics by the First Presidency, recognizing the lofty ideals and compassionate services of the American Red Cross, and endorsing the 1943 Red Cross War Fund Campaign is reproduced herewith:\nFebruary 15, 1943\nTO THE BISHOPRICS OF THE CHURCH:\nThe mission of the Red Cross is to serve humanity; it fosters kindliness of spirit; it radiates Christian brotherhood. Wherever there is a wounded soldier, wherever there is pain or suffering on the field of battle or at the home front there may be found the tender mercies of the ameliorating services of this beneficent organization. It is one banner under which all humankind may enlist in a common cause of mercy and compassion.\nMillions of men in armed forces are marching, sailing, and flying to kill and to conquer. Millions of men and women under the international banner of the Red Cross are marching to administer relief, to give succor, and to save.\nTo make effective and successful this humanitarian work, funds are indispensablethis year more than ever before. The campaign for \"The 1943 Red Cross War Fund\" is already under way. This is not the annual roll call, nor a drive for membership, but it is an appeal to every person earning a dollar to contribute to a great and worthy cause.\nThe Church, recognizing the services of the American National Red Cross as conforming to the lofty ideals and divine principles proclaimed by the Savior of mankind, now urges all its members to contribute funds more liberally than ever before to succor the wounded, to aid the sick, and to comfort the distressed.\nRed Cross Sunday is February 28, 1943. Solicitations will begin March 1, 1943. Now is the time for every man, woman, and child to heed the Nation's clarion call to service.\nSincerely yours,\n(Signed) Heber J. Grant J. Reuben Clark, Jr. David O. McKay\nThe First Presidency\nGraduate Nurses Urged to Return Inventory Cards\nTHE General Board is pleased to cooperate with the National Nursing Council for War Service by requesting stake and mission Relief Society presidents in the United States to announce through their local Societies the inventory of the nursing forces of the country which is now underway. This inventory is being conducted by means of a schedule to be filled in by all registered nurses, irrespective of age, including those actively employed and those who are married or retired. It is believed that there may be many registered nurses not now employed in nursing work who might be available in a national emergency. The states and the nation must know the strength of its nurse power in case of local or national emergency.\nEach state in the nation has its own registration bureau, and every graduate nurse should contact the bureau in her state and obtain a schedule to be filled in and returned to the bureau."

            "content": "The Abuse of Hate in Wartime\nMark K. Allen Psychologist, Utah State Training School\nTHE Teacher of peace, uttered thought provoking words when He said \"Love thine enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\" Now that war has become our principal occupation, we wonder how the doctrine of love and forgiveness might be interpreted today.\nOur enemies have scoffed at our Christian ideals as the babble of weaklings. Their leaders believe that our greatest weakness is that we are Christian. Their greatest hope in defeat will be that we Christians will be generous at the peace table. Friedrich Nietzsche, German philosopher of the nineteenth century, spoke derisively of humility, and his words have been flaunted at us repeatedly by modern dictators. Nietzsche argued that the Christian virtues of service to others, humility, kindness, and sympathy are incompatible with strength. Associated with scorn of gentle virtues is an overbearing militarism and lust for power. Our opponents believe only the strong and ruthless will survive. With this philosophy goes an utter lack of toleration of the rights of others. Thus Hitler teaches that \"The nationalization of the great masses can never take place by way of half measures, by weak emphasis upon a so-called objective viewpoint, but by a ruthless and fanatically one-sided orientation as to the goal to be aimed at.\"\nWe need search no further than our daily papers of the past few years, or numerous passages in Hitler's Mein Kampf, to learn what these teachings have meant to the Jewish people or other non-German nations under their domination. General Haushofer once said that \"Not one of these smaller nations has a right to independent existence.\"\nWe in America today are sharply challenged by this question of race prejudice. In other lands, the problem of racial intolerance is distinctly different from ours. Shall we forsake our Christian and democratic ideals for fear there is something inherently weak in them which might finally give the victory to our opponents? Or should we rally the strength that is latent in Christian principles to bring peace again to the world?\nThe problem is not a remote one for us, but one that affects the daily adjustments of most of us. In a democracy, we are committed to the doctrine that all people are created more or less equal, and America has become the great melting pot for all peoples of the world. Our opponents hope that the racial groups of which our nation is made up will hate each other; they work by every device for internal strife and disunity as part of their \"divide and conquer\" plan. The ideal of the brotherhood of man is a lofty one, and perhaps only approximately attainable by finite man; but it is an ideal without which there can be no strength born of unity in America.\nThe problem of how to treat enemy nationals in our midst is no\nPage 191\n192\neasy one. \"Fifth column\" dangers have made us doubly suspicious. We should be cautious, but no good will come from blindly hating those of enemy nationality.\nTHE role of hatred in war is an interesting one. Perhaps in actual physical combat it has a function. The emotions of hate and fear bring about certain bodily changes which make one fight better. Substances are poured into the blood which release stored up energy facilitating flight or strenuous combat. The blood rushes to the large muscles, the blood vessels in the skin constrict and the blood clots more easily reducing the loss of blood in case of injury. In severe hatred the intellectual processes are dulled to some extent and the individual becomes more fearless of death. However, short of actual combat, violent hatred may waste energy and actually interfere with efficiency. Most of us civilians can be of more assistance by directing our energies into concrete tasks to help win the war. Hatred is contagious and may interfere with the work of others. Enemy nationals among us may be good citizens and just as anxious for us to win the war as we are. A lack of tolerance on our part may interfere with their doing their bit and may even turn them into enemy agents.\nOne reason we cannot recommend hatred without qualification as a weapon of war is that it is so ungovernable, so difficult to direct. Emotional reactions are much less specific than most responses to stimulation. A person who is angry has a \"chip on his shoulder\" and may be\ngruff with everyone. When we experience a prejudice or hatred, our stream of thought is given a certain \"set\" or direction which makes it impossible for us to be objective or to see all sides of a question. This tendency to respond to \"reduced cues\" or only part of the situation is found in almost all kinds of behavior, although especially in emotional behavior. Thus, we read this sentence by seeing only the outlines of the words. Test this by covering with another piece of paper the lower half of the line of print you are now reading. Notice how well you can still follow the meaning. When we hear certain footsteps approach, we know that children are home from school, and these sounds are not often mistaken for the mail man at the door.\nEmotional responses are frequently made to reduced symbols or fragments of previous experiences. A bit of ribbon, an old letter, a pair of little shoes bring back a whole train of pleasant experiences. On a more complex scale, we make many of our judgments about people and many of our important decisions and formulations of opinion on the basis of how we feel about only certain aspects of the situation. Thus, we may have been cheated by a tall blond salesman and thereafter we react negatively to all tall blond people. Racial prejudices partake of this same sort of process. We are likely to think of all foreigners as being more or less alike. Very often we are likely to think of all of a given nationality as falling into a rather definite mold both as to physical appearance and mental characteristics. Negroes are mostly black, the\nTHE ABUSE OF HATE IN WARTIME\nJapanese yellow in complexion; but experiments have demonstrated how difficult it is for most of us to even identify persons of various nationalities by their appearance alone. Our caricatures of the comic sections and cartoons are attempts to use the \"outlines\" of people by which we are most likely to identify them. Caricatures in turn define outstanding characteristics for us, sometimes giving us a false impression of the definiteness of the characteristics. Thus, the college professor is made to appear a dry, prosy person with spectacles and a stiff neck. The Japanese are made to look heinous beasts, the Germans like very stern, heartless militaristsall with much more striking characteristics than, in reality, are ordinarily seen. The moral and mental characteristics of individuals and races are likely to be judged by a more or less abbreviated outline or picture in our minds of what they are.\nTHESE preconceived patterns into which we place people or traits of character are known in social psychology as stereotypes. They are very common to all of us. A well-known error of reasoning known as the \"whole-part fallacy\" is quite similar to stereotypes. According to reports of a few years ago, the Russian people had a stereotyped opinion of us which saw us as a nation of \"money-grabbing capitalists,\" \"playboys,\" gangsters, bootleggers, or divorcees. Investigation revealed that they formed this opinion of us largely through knowing us only through our moving pictures circulated in Russia in which these types of persons were played up too muchthe fallacy of judging the whole by the\n193\npart again. Newspaper headlines about crime and divorce also help to promote this kind of error, simply because headlines are usually about the unusual, not the commonplace, happenings.\nStereotypes are the warp and woof of race prejudice and hatred. When we fully acquaint ourselves with any nationality, we are less likely to continue in our prejudices. Wars would be considerably less likely if we knew more about each other and could really understand one another's point of view in world affairs. Familiarity with others does not always mean friendliness, but friendliness is not possible without some familiarity. Stereotypes are the molds into which we force individualsthey are not total, nor pictures based on a thorough knowledge of other people. War intensifies and solidifies stereotypes; it makes them more emotional in tone, less impartial and intellectual. Atrocity propaganda is aimed at making the enemy appear inhumane and brutal. Unfortunately, the by-product of necessary war propaganda is that such vivid stereotypes are built up that we see all enemy nationals in terms of these stereotypes. Our emotional reactions to the enemy define the stereotypes, and the stereotypes in turn determine our conduct toward enemy nationals among us. Little do we stop to think that these people may, and often do, have very little sympathy with the aims of the enemy. Certainly, in a democracy, these people should be judged to some extent on their own merits, and not entirely in terms of what the enemy of similar nationality has done or is doing to us.\n194\nIf we were to view the available evidence dispassionately, we would see that the differences between individuals of a given nationality are probably greater on the average than are the differences between one nationality and another. There are all kinds of people in every nation, good, bad, and indifferent. We need not judge the whole by the bad part we may have known. For the sake of perpetuating the Christian democratic ideal of the brotherhood of man, we should be excused for taking some justifiable risks in being tolerant toward other nationalities among us. We should be cautious, of course, but we should guard against destroying unwittingly the very ideals we are fighting for. The challenge to make democracy function is a serious one, since our enemies abuse all of our democratic freedoms in an effort to destroy us, or to make us destroy those freedoms ourselves.\nWHAT shall we conclude, then, about hatred in war? Is it evil, should we love our enemies and do only good to them? Perhaps the best answer is for us to learn who our true enemies are, and do everything possible in righteousness to render them powerless, for two important reasons: (1) because if we do not disarm them, they will destroy us, our children, and other innocent people; and (2) because the ideal of the brotherhood of man demands that we unite to preserve the rights of all peoples to live in peace and good will. Our procedure will be actuated by a cool intelligence, it will lead to positive contributions to the\nwar effort; but it will not be diverted into personal crusades against possibly innocent enemy nationals among us. We will be cautious, not hateful toward enemy nationals among us; and when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting enemies among us, we will report to proper governmental authorities, otherwise we shall keep our counsel.\nAs a concrete formula, then, for civilian guidance in the emotion-clouded atmosphere of racial prejudice, we propose the following:\n1. Learn to analyze the bases of our prejudices, and beware of \"stereotypes.\"\n2. Remember the wide range of individual differences in all nationalities. Try to judge people on their individual merits, not by their racial labels.\n3. Don't emulate the racial philosophy of dictators, its delusions of a master race, the wickedness of its fanatical oppression of minority groups.\n4. Remember our responsibility to make the Christian ideal of the brotherhood of man work and survive this great struggle of conflicting ideologies.\n5. In upholding democratic ideals, let us not be blind to enemy abuses of democratic principles to bring about our destruction or to force us to destroy our principles.\n6. Be cautious, not hateful. Don't burn up your energy in aimless hatred. Don't take up personal crusades against enemy nationals, but report to governmental authorities individuals you have reasonable grounds to think should be investigated."

            "content": "Fruits of The Good Earth\nHazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, The Deseret News\nAMONG the sweetest of my stored up childhood memories are those times when we children were allowed to intrude into my grandmother's sanctum sanctorum, her own private refuge and pride, her neat and well-tended kitchen garden where she spent so many long and happy hours. I still recall with a thrill, the delight of entering through that stout and forbidding gate which could close with such finality to keep out flocks of marauding hens and their numerous families, occasionally wandering and curious cows, and yes, squads of assorted sized, eager youngsters of the neighborhood. How exciting to be turned loose among such delectable goodness, what marvels of neatness and fresh smells abounded on all sides to invite healthy young appetites! Even the humble turnips were tender and sweet as we pulled them from the rich soil and ate them on the spot! Incredulously delicious were the tiny ripe strawberries we culled, and how enticing were the long, dangling, jeweled pennants of fruit which hung so invitingly on the rows of currant bushes, both the ruby-red and the translucent white varieties. While as for a certain precious grapevineone of the few growing in the entire high mountain communityhow we loved to reach up its ancient stems which coiled to the top of the wall to pluck the juicy clusters, eventually emerging with mouths gory with purple stain. Truly we reveled in the sweetness of those carefully tended fruits and vegetables as we crammed them into hungry small mouths.\nBoth young and old were privileged to enjoy the full flavor of such home-grown fruits in those days, for almost every home had its rows of berry bushes. Then came the improved methods of transportation and market gardens to supply the family needs, and the growing of these small fruits gradually became less and less usual until now, we seldom see berry patches in any but the commercial gardens. The sad ending to the story is that in choosing the easier way of acquiring our home fruits, we have renounced their greatest charm, their full and natural flavor. No market can bring these delicate fruits to our doors retaining the natural, delicious aroma intact, even in this age of miracles. Most berries are picked for the market before they are entirely ripe in order that they may \"stand up\" under the journey from grower to consumer; or if they are left on the bushes until they are ripe, they become a wilted and faded mass ere they have arrived at their destination. There are actually many of our own generation who have never tasted the true delights of these flavorsome but perishable fruits because they have eaten only those sold in the markets. It is only when we eat these tender fruits soon after they are picked, with all their luscious goodness dew-\nPage 195\n196\nfresh, that we know all their true sweetness. Then indeed are they \"food for the gods,\" real nectar and ambrosia.\nBUT with the coming of war with its many demands upon the facilities of our own country, our Government is urging, yes even is demanding, that home owners again work the soil and make every bit of ground produce food. We are urged to include berries and other small fruits in our Victory Gardens to provide our own families with these necessities, and thus leave our market crops for our vast armies as well as our less fortunate Allies. Last year, many home gardeners found how profitable such an undertaking was, even in the small city backyard. Soon, we may again be enjoying all the joys of growing our own berries, and thus become acquainted with the newest types, some of which are vastly superior to the old varieties grown in grandmother's day.\nIn the case of strawberries, which are perhaps the easiest of all berries for the small city gardener to manage, one may now have not only early, mid-season, and late varieties, but high quality everbearing strains which will begin to produce soon after the June berries are over, and continue to provide berries of fine flavor and texture until late October. Such new varieties as \"New Mammoth\" are to be recommended for their fine quality. By planting these everbearers as soon as the ground is workable, and by removing all runners as they appear as well as the first crop of blossoms, these everbearers will bear a full crop the same year that they are\nplanted, whereas the ordinary strawberry does not produce a good crop until the second year after planting. Some growers advocate that the everbearers should be planted afresh every year, and the first crop of blossoms removed to store up strength for a full later crop, thus producing the finest berries in one short season.\nA new variety of raspberry is also making history and giving home gardeners the benefit of a most luscious, seedless, and delicious of raspberries, far finer than any of the old common everbearing kinds. Imagine having these delightful fruits from mid-July on almost until snow flies! This is actually true of the new \"Colossus.\" The first crop is produced on the canes which grew last year, and a later developing cane grows up and gives a long season during the fall months. The size, flavor, and color of this fine new variety of fruit are exceptional. Almost any garden can find room for at least a few raspberry bushes, for they will do well in a little shade. While the bushes should have some sun, they will also welcome coolness and protection from hot drying conditions. Provide rich, well fertilized soil and plenty of moisture if you would grow berries of which you can boast to your neighbor. Two or three plants for each member of your family will supply you with berries enough for your table use. Do not plant too many bushes but give those you do plant good care and attention.\nCurrants and gooseberries are also excellent subjects for any backyard garden, for these, too, thrive well in some partially shady spot. Rich soil, plenty of moisture, and attention to pruning when the bushes have been\nFRUITS OF THE GOOD EARTH\n197\nPIONEER GARDEN\nApricot, plum, and pear trees; raspberry, gooseberry, and currant bushes; and grapevine at extreme right are all found in this early day backyard.\nGrowing a few years, will give good returns.\nFOR the home gardener who has a little more room in which to grow fruit, we have those richly flavored berries that are almost classed as aristocrats, the zestful loganberry, the luscious and nectar filled boysenberry and the jolly plump blackberry. These fruits are fit subjects for some poet's rhyme when fully ripened and eaten dew-fresh from the bush. The tart and flavorless specimens often sold are but poor and tasteless shadows of these berries when picked in their primesweet and fragrant with the sun. These berries should be trained on some support, and a pleasant little garden could surely be made by combining all of these fine subjects to make a small berry garden. Utility could combine with beauty, for the blackberries, dewberries, and others could be trained on any fence or trellis, while annual flowers could easily be planted between the bushes grown in rows, and thus they could receive moisture with no extra effort.\nWarning should be given that only enough bushes for the family needs be planted. The picking of fruit becomes a task if large plantings are grown, and thus the fruit garden becomes a problem in upkeep. A few well-cared for plants will give far greater and better returns than a larger planting which is indifferently cultivated. Do not put out bushes enough to become burdensome.\nJoin the ranks of the city gardeners and bring to your table all the delicious fruits of the good and bounteous earth!"

Evans Member of Relief Society General Board\nTHE lengthening days and balmy air remind us that spring is here, and before we realize it, we shall be \"stepping smartly into summer\" with a wardrobe of cool, comfortable dresses. But this year it is wartime as well as summertime. Added responsibilities have come to homemakers and to those who must provide the family wardrobe. New colors, new dyes, and new fabrics have made their appearance and require study both in their selection and their care. But equally important is the fact that old fabrics, especially woolen materials, are disappearing from the market, and it is therefore imperative that our fall and winter clothing, our draperies, rugs, and other articles made of wool or part-wool should be stored for the summer with special care. It may be a long time before we shall again be able to purchase the broadcloth, tweeds, serges, and other excellent materials which this spring we shall store as overcoats, suits, and dresses we have worn without fully appreciating the value of the fabrics. Synthetic soybean wool, a wool fiber made from the soybean, is already a reality, but its utility is yet to be demonstrated.\nHomemakers this year are working longer hours than usual, many dividing their time between their homes and outside employments, and it may not be possible for them to give the customary attention to their shelves and closets, with a fortnightly brushing, airing, and sunning of un-\nPage 198\nused garments. Some special attention given now will insure the protection of scarce and valuable materials.\nIn storing woolens, our chief concern is to protect them from moth injury. Moths do not eat cotton, linen, rayon, or other fabrics of vegetable fiber, or silk. Moths never cause injury in bureau drawers or trunks filled only with vegetable fabrics. Our only concern in storing these fabrics is that they shall be kept clean, and that our choice, white linens shall be laundered and sunned occasionally to insure their original whiteness.\nBy the intelligent use of certain preparations, moths in every stage of development may be killed. There are liquids, used as sprays, and also crystals which are effective. While some of these preparations are harmless and safe, others are inflammable, and some are explosive. Any of them should be used with caution and used only after thoroughly acquainting oneself with their dangers. We do not wish to imply, either, that the use of any of these preparations is necessary in order to avoid injury caused by moths. Many careful housekeepers who have never used moth preventives in any form can say with confidence, \"I do not worry about moths, for I never have any.\"\nWe are warned by students of this subject that \"there is no season for moths\" nor do moths ever take a vacation. All stages of the moth cycle are dangerous: the egg, because\nWINTER CLOTHES IN SUMMERTIME\nit hatches into the greedy larva; the larva, because it is the feeder which actually cuts the holes; and the flying moth, because it distributes its eggs and starts the cycle all over again. The \"actual villain,\" however, is the larva. He likes the soft, silky fibers of wool because they supply him with the food he needs to enter the pupa stage. All clothes-moth larvae eat and eat until they become pupae, then shed their skins and become flying moths. In this state, the moth goes about and lays eggs in the places where she thinks her offspring will do well, in dark places because the pupae do not thrive in light, and in wool because it will furnish food. All articles to be stored should be put away absolutely clean. This is not only an insurance against damage, but it is a comfortable feeling to know that when the article will be needed, it will be ready for immediate use. Moths are much more likely to concentrate upon soiled spots; and dust and grit work into the threads and shorten the life of the fabric. We are told that \"brushing and beating usually kill the larvae. The soft eggs are easily crushed or dislodged by thorough brushing. Particular attention should be given to cuffs, hems, seams, and pockets. Moths cannot stand bright sun. Larvae drop to the ground from clothing left hanging in the sun on the clothesline, especially if no folds are present in which they can find protection from the sun's rays.\" If clothing is thoroughly brushed and sunned every two weeks, it is 199 doubtful if moths can affect it seriously. The-old-time custom of sunning clothing as an insurance against moth injury is based upon successful experience. Carpets and rugs cleaned by strong vacuum cleaners and thoroughly brushed on both sides, and clothing dry-cleaned or laundered with soap and water are freed from infestation. Once freed, clothes may be protected, if not to be used during the warm season, by being wrapped in paper with the ends securely sealed, or placed in tight, sealed boxes. The \"moth-proof\" bags, made of heavy paper impregnated with tar or other substances, if not torn, are 'excellent for keeping moths from reaching clothing. Obviously, they are of no value in killing larvae that may be in the clothing when it is placed in the bag. Any bag made of plain paper is just as good as bags containing tar or cedar and pine oils. In fact, clothes moths will not eat into paper to reach clothing, so that moth-free articles wrapped in ordinary firm wrapping paper or several thicknesses of newspapers will be safe, provided the ends of the wrappings are securely sealed so that the moth cannot enter the edges. The bulletins issued by the United States Department of Agriculture emphasize the fact that perseverance is the keynote of moth character. It is said that the moth's capacity to search out and enter the most secluded hiding places is almost beyond belief. The flying moth, for instance, \"merely closes its wings and crawls through the trunk keyhole or other tiny apertures through which issue enticing odors of wool.\" Frequently, clothing on coat hangers 200 is placed in bags with the hooks of the hangers protruding from the bag so that the bag containing the clothing may be hung in the closet. Unless special attention is given to the careful sealing of the aperture about the hooks, moths will have no difficulty in crawling into it, and once they enter, the bags are useless. N storing your winter clothes make the cleaning and arranging of your clothes closets a special feature. The clothes closet can be one of the most attractive rooms in your home. Only cleanliness and orderliness, however, will make it so. Thought and planning for this little room will repay you abundantly in time and energy saved. The convenient and spacious closets of the modern home are in themselves attractive, yet they can be marred by disorder. On the other hand, a small and crowded closet may, by an orderly and wise arrangement of its contents, be made so attractive that, upon entering it, you have a sense of restfulness and wellbeing. The clothes closet must be spotlessly clean. Paint closets often. There is nothing that gives more encouragement to orderliness than fresh, clean paint. If you are to arrange a crowded closet, make a definite plan before you begin your arrangement. Store as many things as possible in covered boxes. Select uniform containers, their size dependent upon the size of the shelves upon which they are to be placed. These may be stacked one upon another, even up to the ceiling of the room. Gummed labels should be attached to the front of the boxes listing the contents of each. Box, so that any article may be easily accessible when needed. This will relieve the congestion in the remaining storage space and make the daily use of the closet more pleasant and comfortable. As homemakers, let us open the doors of our attractive and orderly closets this summer, with pride in the thought that this year we have not just \"put away our old clothes for the summer,\" but that we have safely stored fabrics which cannot be replaced, clothes of excellent material which can be worn another season with that satisfaction which comes from the practice of true thrift.

IT was like a small cyclone in the quiet room. Paste bottle, scissors, and paper went flying in every direction as Stevie, bursting into a fit of sudden anger, flung his tools away from him. \"They're mean!\" he cried vehemently. \"They won't stick!\" Janet shocked at such unusual behavior spoke more sharply than she was accustomed to, \"For shame, Stevie!\" Mr. And Mrs. Allen looked up from their own work, startled, too, at the sudden little tempest. \"Bedtime, son?\" Mr. Allen suggested. \"I don't want to go to bed, either!\" cried Stevie. \"I don't want to do anything!\": Janet laid aside her own work and came around the table to her brother. She smiled apologetically at their foster parents. \"I'll put him to bed. I guess he's sort of tired,\" she explained. In the bedroom she undressed him silently. She had learned long ago that scolding did no good with Stevie. He wasn't a bad little boy, really. When he was naughty, it was generally something inside him; and if she gave him enough time he would tell her what it was. But tonight Stevie didn't intend to tell her anything, she could see that. So she washed his hands and face, combed his curly dark red hair, a task she adored, and tucked him. Into bed. Then she bent over him. \"Goodnight, Stevie,\" she said in her gentlest voice. His small arms came out of the covers, up around his sister's neck. He held her close to him, as if he would never let her go. Janet could feel his heart pounding, and she wondered whether he had been frightened someway. Then suddenly he let her go and turned his face to the wall without a word. Janet stood still a moment or two longer, then slipped quietly out of the room. She went back to the table, where she was making a scrapbook on transportation for her fourth grade social studies class, and sat down to her work. She was embarrassed that Stevie should act so. Not once before in the year since the Allens had adopted them had he ever acted like that. She thought she'd better explain.\n\"When we were at the Home,\" she began doubtfully, \"sometimes, if the bigger boys had been scaring Stevie, he acted that way. I know he didn't do it because he's naughty\"\nMr. Allen got up and came and sat down beside her. He was smiling, and his blue eyes were twinkling. \"Now, Miss Worry,\" he teased, \"you don't need to tell us that. We've had Stevie long enough to know he's just the best little fellow ever. Any boy has to be cross sometimes. Can't I help you with that scrapbook, honey?\"\nHe began to clip pictures of trains\nPage 201\n202\nand automobiles and airplanes, showing a surprising deftness. Janet looked at him and laughed.\n\"You kids have all the fun!\" he said, \"When I was your age, cutting out pictures was somewhat on the forbidden side. We certainly never got credit in school for it, did we, Mother?\"\nMommy looked up from her sewing and smiled. \"That's the fun of having children,\" she said, \"we get to enjoy all the new things!\"\nTHE clock struck the hour of Janet's bedtime, so she stood up and gathered up her materials to put away for the night. When she came to kiss her parents goodnight, they were sitting very still, looking at each other.\n\"Don't you think we ought to tell Janet our big secret, dear?\" Mommy asked.\nMr. Allen drew Janet to his knee. \"It's about time,\" he smiled, \"I've been bursting with it for days. Janet, honey, how would you like a new brother or sister?\"\nAt first the words didn't mean much to Janet. She smiled. \"From the Home?\" she asked, her mind flying back to the different children there, a vague little feeling that things were quite all right without changing them ruffling her mind's surface.\n\"Oh, no! A real brother or sister; one of our very own!\"\nJanet grew very still; even her heart seemed to stop beating, waiting what would come next. The arm about her tightened; her father's lips were against her hair. \"We're so excited about it we\ncouldn't wait to share the good news with you. You've been so wonderful with Stevie. But he's getting to be such a big boy now, nearly seven. This will be a tiny baby that you can tend and love.\"\nJanet wanted to tell them she was thrilled and happy, but she couldn't make any words come. She was happy, if they were; but she'd thought, oh she had thought that she and Stevie were all they wanted. A baby of their very own, her daddy had said. A real brother or sister. What was Stevie, then? What was she? Her throat ached.\nHer mother came over and knelt beside them. \"I know Janet understands just how I feel about this, don't you, darling? You love babies, too, and some day you'll grow up and have a cuddly little baby of your very own to hold in your arms and love. Then you'll know what it's like. Then you'll understand how you can love Stevie so much, and me and daddy and still love your own little baby, too. It takes so many kinds of love to make a family, doesn't it? And I'm so glad I have a big daughter to share this new love with me.\"\nJanet reached her arms up and put them around her mother's neck. \"I am glad!\" she whispered. \"Babies smell so sweet in the back of the neck, don't they? May I help you make the clothes for it?\"\nHer parents smiled at her. They were all happy, all excited, making plans. But when Janet went into her bedroom she thought of Stevie, and went to look at him as he slept in his little bed in the next room. She wondered"

But when Janet went into her bedroom she thought of Stevie, and went to look at him as he slept in his little bed in the next room. She wondered\nTHERE'S ALWAYS A WAY\nif he knew; if that was what had troubled him. He stirred in his sleep, then opened his eyes and seeing Janet he began to whimper. Janet knelt down beside his bed, and put her arms around him.\n\"Oh, Janet!\" he cried, \"will we have to go? Won't they want us any more? I heard Mommy and Daddy say they were going to get a new baby of their own. And they didn't tell me, and I'm scared!\"\n\"Of course we don't have to go,\" Janet reassured him. \"We're their very own, too. It will just mean one more to play with. Think what fun you can have.\" Then she talked of games and pleasures Stevie particularly liked until he was quieted, and at last fell asleep.\nIN her own bed Janet lay very still, thinking things out. She understood just how Stevie felt; she'd been a little bit afraid, herself, at first. But that was silly. Of course Mommy was glad she was going to have a baby. If they'd had their own mother, their very owntears stung Janet's eyes though she loved this new mother so dearlythere might have been other babies in time, and she and Stevie would have been delighted. So they should be delighted now. And she was! She told herself determinedly. She'd have to make Stevie see it, too.\nBut Stevie didn't want to see it, evidently. He awoke the next morning in the same stubborn, resentful mood he had shown the day before, and nothing Mrs. Allen nor Janet could say or do pleased him. They told him about the coming baby, just as carefully as they could.\n203\nStevie glared at them and then, without a word, turned and banged out of the door, stamping his feet down to make all the angry noise he could. Janet looked up at Mrs. Allen in silent apology for her brother. If he doesn't stop, she told herself, he's going to spoil everything. Mommy was worried, Janet could see. She looked at the little girl and said, \"I wouldn't have him feel like this for anything. Doesn't he understand that we love him dearly? No one can take Stevie's place with us!\"\nJanet knew this was true, now, but she knew it was going to be hard to make Stevie absolutely sure of it. \"It's just because he's scared,\" she explained. \"He's not very old, yet, and he hasn't forgotten living in the Home. It was nice there,\" she hurried to add, \"but neither of us would care to go back.\"\n\"You darlings!\" Mommy gathered Janet close, \"You'll never have to go back.\"\n\"But three's quite a big family for Daddy, isn't it?\"\nMommy laughed. \"Not nearly big enough!\" she cried. \"I hope we have a lot of children so we can have a lot of fun!\"\n\"Stevie will be all right afterwhile, I'm sure!\" Janet went on. \"But you know how boys are. It takes them quite a while to get used to a new idea.\"\nJanet was surprised at herself, the way she was planning for the new baby, the joy with which she was looking forward to it. She had always loved the babies in the Home, had always been called on to help with them. Now she would have one right here, day after day, night\n204\nafter night, to bathe, to dress\nAnd Mommy was so generous in sharing her plans for the new baby. She took Janet shopping with her to buy little bootees and sacques, and Janet was learning to knit a shawl of the most beautiful soft pink yarn. Everything would be perfect, Janet told herself, if it weren't for Stevie.\nAFTER that one night he hadn't mentioned the coming baby to his sister. He had scarcely talked to her at all. His gay, continuous chatter was stilled into a surly aloofness that made Janet's heart ache. He banged and kicked at things. He sat for long spells alone on the back porch, looking across the yard at nothing. His goodnight kiss for his father and mother were quick, sullen pecks, and when he sat on daddy's lap for the evening story he didn't snuggle down as he ought to do, but sat stiff and withdrawn and unhappy.\n\"What are we going to do with that fellow?\" Daddy asked one night, running his hand up through his hair till he looked as worried and unhappy and almost as little boyish as Stevie himself. \"We're doing everything we can, aren't we Janet?\"\nMommy answered. \"I think we'd better just ignore his attitude. Just go along as if nothing were wrong with him, talk about the baby, treat him as if he were as happy as we all are. I guess that is about all we can do.\" Then she smiled at Janet, \"We couldn't manage at all without Janet,\" she said tenderly, and Janet was glad that she was being such a help, and sorry that Stevie felt so badly.\n\"It's just that I hate to have him\nunhappy,\" Daddy went on, still worrying over Stevie. \"It could be so much fun for all of us. But you can't tell what a little fellow like Stevie will do when he is so unhappy. I can remember things like that when I was a kidoh, not just the same, but things that worried me so that I was going around all the time trying to figure a way out. I'm worried.\"\nJanet couldn't bear to see Daddy worried like that. She went over and put her arms around him. \"It's going to be all right,\" she promised, \"I'll find something to take his mind off it.\"\n\"You're a honey!\" Daddy squeezed her, then sat up straight. \"Say, Sweetheart, maybe you have something there. Something to take his mind off itHasn't he been wanting a puppy? Why can't we get him one? Then he'll have something to think about besides himself and his 'broken nose.'\"\nJanet clapped her hands. \"I believe that would do it!\" she cried.\nSo the next morning at breakfast Daddy said with an air of great excitement, \"Queenie's going to have pups very soon now, Stevie. Shall I speak to Mr. Wilson for one? Would you like one of Queenie's pups?\"\nStevie nodded his head, \"Uh-huh,\" he answered without enthusiasm. Janet exclaimed, \"Won't that be fun, a baby puppy! When do you think they will come, Daddy?\"\nBut Stevie wasn't interested at all, and later that morning when Queenie came over to Stevie as he sat on the back step, he pushed her away. \"Go on home, Queenie!\" he said. \"Nobody wants you hanging round here!\"\nTHERE'S ALWAYS A WAY\nJanet, standing just within the kitchen, shook her head. Stevie certainly did feel badly when he'd treat Queenie that way, for Queenie, whose home was next door with the Wilsons, had been one of Stevie's best friends. Janet went out and sat down beside her brother.\n\"I'll bet you made Queenie feel bad when you treated her like that!\" she said. But Stevie kicked at the gravel and didn't answer.\n\"Aren't you excited about having one of her puppies?\" Janet went on. \"It'll probably be a lot like Queenie. Daddy said her pups are extra fine. They're registered and everything!\"\n\"What's registered?\" Stevie asked listlessly.\n\"Oh,\" Janet explained, \"when people have extra nice dogs they keep records about them that tell who their mammas and papas are, their grandparents and everyone else, so the people know all about the dogs and all about their puppies. It makes them worth a lot more money. And it's interesting, too!\"\nStevie shook his head, \"Who cares about a dog's father and mother? It's the dog that counts!\" he replied, ready to pick a quarrel over any little thing. Janet sat there, her chin in her hands, thinking. Stevie was right, maybe more truly right than he knew. Maybe this was getting down to his real trouble. The new baby would have its own mother and father, while he, Stevie, felt like an outcast. Maybe he had a real grudge against Queenie, after all.\nTHAT evening after Stevie was in bed, Janet perched herself on the arm of her daddy's chair.\n205\n\"Daddy,\" she began, cautiously. \"are you very anxious to have us have one of Queenie's pups?\"\n\"Now, what's behind that question, Sweetheart?\" her father asked, pulling a lock of her red hair playfully.\n\"Well I just wondered, do you care what kind of dog Stevie has?\"\n\"Why, of course not!\" her father answered, \"Has he set his heart on some particular dog? We'll get it for him, if he has.\"\n\"No,\" Janet was finding it hard, now, to explain the shadowy feeling she'd had that afternoon. \"It's just that Queenie's pups would be so sowell, so much a part of her family, you know, with cousins and brothers and sisters and a mother\" Her words came tumbling, now they had got started, \"and right now Stevie is feeling, oh, as if he didn't have any real family at all. And I just thought if he could have a dog like him, you know, one that was sort of lonely, he might feel that it was more his very own, you know. I was wondering, do they have Homes for dogs?\"\nHer father, looking at her quizzically, was beginning to get the meaning. \"There's the dog pound,\" he suggested.\n\"Dog pound?\" doubtfully.\n\"Yes. Lost and strayed dogs are taken there and kept till some one calls for them. Sometimes their owners come; sometimes they are given to other people. Lots of times when people want dogs they go to the dog pound to find one.\"\nJanet's eyes were shining. \"That's just the thing. Don't you\n206\nsee! If we could get Stevie out to the dog pound and he could find a puppy there that needed a home, and that sort of took to him,\" she looked shyly, eagerly at him, \"Sort of the way we needed you and took to you, you see, then, if Stevie could have that dog, why he'd love it more than anything else and he would know how you feel about us. See?\"\nJanet wondered if those were really tears in her daddy's eyes, and why? As he drew her very, very close in his arms and whispered, \"A woman of understanding is more precious than fine jewels. Sweetheart, your daddy takes his hat off to you.\" Then he laughed, gaily, \"We'll do it!\"\n\"But he mustn't know what we're doing, Daddy! We've got to let him think it is all his very own idea!\"\nON Saturday afternoon when Daddy backed the car out of the garage, Janet shouted, \"Where you going, Daddy?\"\n\"To see a man on business,\" her father answered, and then added, \"Do you kids want to go along for the ride? We don't get so many rides as we used to, do we?\"\n\"Sure!\" cried Janet. \"Come on, Stevie!\"\nEven Stevie's resentment couldn't withstand the thought of a car ride on a lovely afternoon, they were so few, now, these joyous trips; so he came over and climbed into the front seat. But he wasn't going to enjoy it, any one could see that. He sat staring out, saying nothing. They drove along, pretending not to notice Stevie's attitude, talking and laughing, Janet and her father, bringing Stevie into the conversation when they could, but making no point of it.\nAt last they were outside the city and Daddy was parking the car in front of a low cement building. \"Where are we?\" Stevie asked, and when his father said, \"This is the dog pound!\" Stevie questioned, without interest, \"What's a dog pound?\" but paid little attention to his father's brief explanation.\nThey went inside, and Daddy began to talk to the man there, leaving the children to their own devices. There was a sound of barking somewhere within the building and Janet went nearer to the two men, as if she would ask a question. Her father said, \"There are some dogs in the back. Just go through that door if you want to look at them while I'm talking.\"\n\"Come on, Stevie!\" cried Janet, taking her brother's hand and opening the door for him.\nThe opening of the door seemed to be a signal of some sort, for suddenly there was a great uproar of barking, scratching, jumping, and tail wagging. Big dogs barked in big, deep voices; little dogs barked in sharp, quick tones; and puppies gave their own glad sounds as every dog in the place tried to leap through the wires and come toward the children. For just an instant Stevie stood still, his back against the door, gripping Janet's hand tightly. Before them stretched two long rows of wire cages with clean floors and running water. There was a strong dog smell in the room and the noise kept increasing. Stevie blinked, then went slowly ahead, letting go of Janet's hand. He peered into the first cage, where a big black dog was trying to\nTHERE'S ALWAYS A WAY\nmake the children notice him above all others. \"Hey, big boy!\" Stevie said, \"Don't make so much noise!\" The dog danced and pressed close to the wire. In the next cage was a collie, serene and cool in spite of its attempts to attract attention, and Stevie looked at it and said, \"Hi ya, Beauty?\" and moved on. At each cage the little boy stopped and spoke to the inmate, and the dog within, with that canny sense that dogs possess of knowing a friend, leaped and greeted him, and as he passed, barked helplessly to call him back. Then halfway down the long line of dogs, Stevie stopped for a brief moment and then sank to his knees. \"Hello, Fellow!\" he said, \"Hi, Spot! Here, Spot! Come here, Boy!\" and he put his face against the wire while the puppy within went nearly crazy with excitement and joy. Janet, watching, thought what a funny puppy it was. It was mostly white, with a few black spots scattered over its shaggy fur. One spot, circling his left eye, gave the puppy a solemn appearance; but one ear was longer than the other, and this gave him a comical look, too. So you really didn't know whether to laugh or not when you looked at him. But Stevie knew. With his face pressed against the wire, he was down on his knees, laughing and talking to the puppy. Stevie was saying things that only boys and dogs know about and understand, and when Janet called, \"Stevie, come see this one!\" her brother rose and moved slowly, reluctantly, away from the funny puppy as it threw itself against\n207\nthe wire in a crazy effort to follow.\nThe door opened and Daddy and the man came in. Stevie ran to the man, \"Whose puppy is that?\" he asked.\nThe man looked down at him and smiled. \"It's nobody's puppy right now,\" he said. \"It was brought in the other night during the big rainstorm, shivering, and hungry, and lost. Nobody has called for it, and nobody seems to want it. But he's cute, isn't he?\"\nStevie went back to the puppy and knelt down by it again. \"Time to go, children!\" Daddy called, and turned to leave the room. Janet followed, and, more slowly, came Stevie. But at the door he turned and flew back down the aisle to tell his new friend goodbye. Janet and her father didn't dare look at each other for fear they'd laugh out loud. They climbed into the car and sat waiting patiently for the little boy. He came out at last and stood there on the ground beside the car looking up at his father. His face was dirty where the puppy's paws had reached through the wide mesh of the wire and caressed it; but it was clean where tears had run down in narrow crooked channels.\n\"Daddy!\" said Stevie, \"You said I could have a puppy? Can I? Can I have a puppy, Daddy?\"\n\"Why, of course,\" smiled his father. \"Queenie will be having pups in a few days now and I'm sure Mr. Wilson will give us one.\"\nStevie shook his head. \"I don't want Queenie's pups!\" he said, \"And it won't want me. It won't want to leave its mother.\"\n(Continued on page 224)\nFROM THE FIELD\nVera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer\nAccounts of local Relief Society centennial celebrations occurring on or near March 17, 1942 have appeared in several recent issues of the Magazine. These accounts are concluded in this issue and no further contributions relating principally to the centennial will be published in this department of the Magazine.\nRELIEF SOCIETY CENTENNIAL OBSERVANCES\nReno Stake (Reno, Nevada)\nMARGUERITA ESSEX, present president of Alturas (California) Branch Relief Society, recently sent us this interesting report of centennial activities.\n\"We honored the centennial of Relief Society by planting a weeping willow tree. Inasmuch as we do not own property here, we planted the tree on the grounds near the Boy Scout Hall, the building in which we hold our services. We therefore not only commemorated the centennial, but also beautified the grounds belonging to the scouts. We now are planning to set a bronze marker in a cement block on March 17, 1943. Mabel Schick, secretary of our Relief Society organization, donated the tree, for which we are very grateful. The tree was very small when we planted it, but it is growing rapidly in size and beauty.

Crossing The River (Continued from page 178) velop, they now began to establish the comfortable pattern of life which they had left in Utah. These pioneers were coming to realize that their ideals had not changed because of privations, and that even when they were living in shanties and dirtroofed houses, the finer things of life were treasured and cultivated. Flowers were planted which bloomed. 'Throughout all the tragic troubles over water, the tea kettles in Arizona bubbled as blithely as ever they did in Utah. The friends who were bound into a oneness that day of the \"crossing,\" were ever the real friends. Always believing, finally they knew that Arizona was also Zion. An Arizona Temple had been promised, and was built. Human ingenuity and close spiritual ties built a bridge across the Colorado and a new and easier road to beloved Utah. Today one feels no terror in looking down that almost perpendicular canyon to the ribbon-like river far below. Its roar is faint, like an echo from the past. The Arizona of the pioneers is to its children and its children's children the \"land of heart's desire.\" Happily, lustily they sing her state song \"O Arizona, Sun-Kissed Land!\" Prayer for Relief Society \"We would hold up before thee, O Lord, the Relief Societies, with all their members; and all those who preside in their midst according to their callings and appointments, general or local.

Wilford Woodruff at Dedication of Salt Lake Temple Work -and- (Business New-fashioned Thrift Lesson 8 Preservation of Victory Garden Products (For optional use on Tuesday, May 11, 1943) HE thought of harvest and preservation of food is usually linked with autumnthe time when all the luscious, varicolored fruits and vegetables, brimful of vitamins and minerals, make such a definite appeal to the appetite. However, harvest time is not any One season in this country; our food crops are gathered the year round. But in spite of the continuous production, most small fruits and quick-ripening vegetables, such as strawberries, raspberries, peas, and asparagus are short lived and are seasonally found on the market. Because of this, and in order to have such foods in the daily diet, it is important to preserve them in such a way as to retain their natural flavor, form, and food value. Although many Victory Gardens were grown last year, there are indications that many more, on a much larger scale, will be grown during the coming season. In order that time, energy, and manpower will not be lost, every bit of the food produced should be utilized. 'That which is not used immediately, when fresh, should be preserved by storing, canning, drying, or freezing. Storing Some kinds of crops are better suited to storage than others. 'This should be kept in mind at the time of planting; but whatever kind is grown, its proper stage of maturity for successful storage must be considered. Underripe products shrivel and do not keep well, while overripe ones are usually inferior in quality. Vegetables and root crops when stored do not all require the same temperature nor humidity, and the storage periods differ. Beets, carrots, turnips, and similar vegetables keep best when stored at 32-36 F. With relative humidity of 85-95 per cent, and will keep four to five months. Squash and pumpkins require 40 F. With relative humidity of 50-70 per cent. Potatoes should be stored in a dark place with a relative humidity of 85-90 per cent, and keep best at 35-40 F. Higher temperatures cause them to sprout soon, and sometimes cause a decay in the center known as \"black heart.' Apples like a cool, moist atmosphere and will keep crisp and firm many months if properly stored. In preparing fruits and vegetables for storage, those with any kind of bruise, crack, or injury shoud be separated from the more perfect ones; defective ones should be used first and only firm ones stored permanently. There are several types of storage, and the kind best suited to your circumstances and needs should be used. Parsnips, carrots, and horseradish can be left in the ground all winter with a covering of straw, and dug or pulled as needed. Next to this type, the mound is the simplest form of storage. A layer of straw is Page 222 222 put on the area of ground needed, then the vegetables are piled on it in mound shape and covered with a layer of straw and then a layer of soil. The thickness of the covering will depend upon the severity of the weather in a given locality. A storage pit is made by digging a hole one to one and one-half feet deep and three to four feet wide. The pit is lined with straw, and the vegetables are piled into it in pyramid shape and covered with straw and soil. Freezing weather requires a thick layer of soil. Indoor cellars, if cool and ventilated, are good, but the modern, heated home with a cement basement is not so good for the storage of raw fruits and vegetables. Outdoor cellars are built on a more elaborate scale, and are used when it is planned to store large amounts of food products. Canning Canning is a type of food preservation used more extensively by house- wives than any other type. All kinds of fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, and fish can be preserved in this way. The methods which may be used are known as: open kettle, pressure cooker, water bath, steamer, and oven. To be perfectly safe, however, in canning non-acid vegetables and meats of all kinds, a pressure cooker should be used. In using a pressure cooker, instructions for its proper use and care should be studied carefully to prevent accidents and waste of food. A pressure cooker is as safe as any other piece of equipment and is easy to handle if a few precautions are taken. With the open kettle method, fruits are cooked in syrup until just tender, packed in sterile glass jars and sealed quickly and completely. Care must be taken with this method to prevent bacteria-laden air from getting into the jars when filled. 'The water bath method is used for fruits and tomatoes. With this method a kettle or wash boiler is used which has a tightly fitting lid and which is deep enough to permit covering the jars with two inches of water. A wooden or wire rack is fitted into the bottom of the kettle to keep the jars from breaking. The water is kept boiling during the entire process, otherwise, water from the boiler may replace some juice from the jars. The cooking period is counted from the time the water begins to boil vigorously. The steamer method is used for the same kind of products as the water bath. 'There must be a good circulation of steam to insure efficient sterilization of the products to be processed. A steamer may be made for the purpose, or the same equipment as that used for the water bath method may be used. Directions for operating the type of steamer used should be carefully followed. Oven method is recommended for berries and small fruits only, and should be used only when heat can be controlled. Peaches, pears, and other large fruits do not get sufficient sterilization with this method; a brownish discoloration often develops which does not always show up until the jars are opened. Drying Vegetables and fruits may be dried to remove sufficient moisture to prevent spoiling. Drying can be done at home in a dehydrator. Because fruit turns dark when cut or peeled, LESSON DEPARTMENT better results are obtained if this change can be brought about before the drying is done. Sulphuring or the use of a salt solution will help to accomplish this. The latter is easier when the drying is done at home, but it does not result in as good a finished product. In using this method the fruit is peeled, and then immersed in the solution (6 level tbs. Salt to 1 gal. Water). Fruit may also be dried without peeling. Non-acid vegetables and those which cannot be preserved by storing can be dried when a pressure cooker is not available. Freezing Like drying, freezing as a method of food preservation, especially for meats, was used in early days when no other method was available. But only within the last ten or twelve years has this method developed so that all the food values are retained and the products are like perfectly fresh ones. Quick freezing is not cold storage. In quick freezing the temperature. Is lowered so fast that the ice crystals do not enlarge and cut the delicate cell walls. When the products are defrosted, the original flavor and juices are still there. Not all foods, however, yield to this process in the same way, but as time goes on more foods are being successfully preserved by this method. So far, this is not a practical home process, but many housewives have access to community lockers and are learning to prepare their own products for freezing, or they pay a small 223 amount to have them prepared by a plant. Locker plants are mostly operated as a community project or by ice companies and meat dealers who rent space to their customers. Whichever process of preservation is used, the same care in the selection and preparation of the foods is necessary as though the foods were to be used immediately. Firm, wellmatured products should be carefully and quickly handled and thoroughly cleaned. All utensils, jars, caps, rubbers, and other containers must be perfectly sterilized. 'The time of the processing should be carefully calculated so the product will not be underdone or overdone. The careful storing of canned and dried foods is important. A cool, dark, dry atmosphere is best for food in glass containers. It is advisable to give foods dried in the sun a final heating in the oven to kill any microorganisms that might be present. Foods dried in a dehydrator will be free of any of these, but should be stored as soon as they are cool, in airtight cans, jars, or small paper bags. If dehydrated foods are put in cartons which hold only an amount sufficient for use at one time, then large amounts will not be disturbed nor exposed to the air unnecessarily. Note: Space will not permit detailed instructions on all the methods and procedures of preservation, but help and instructions may be obtained from the extension personnel of the various agricultural colleges. Every housewife should pre. Serve all the food that she can use.  There's Always A Way (Continued from page 207) He stood there, beseeching his father with his wide, blue eyes, and Mr. Allen and Janet could hardly bear it when two tears welled up and spilled down the cheeks they loved so dearly. \"Daddy! Can't Ihave Spot? He's _ all alone, and he doesn't want me to leave him!\" \"Spot?\" Mr. Allen pretended not to understand. Stevie nodded. \"He knew me as soon as I came into the room,\" he explained, \"And I knew him. He wants to be my dog, and I want him. The man said nobody else wants him. Please, Daddy?\" Mr. Allen climbed down from the car. \"Let's see about this,\" he said, and Janet hurried to follow them into the office again. \"Why, of course Stevie can have the puppy if he wants him,\" the man smiled. \"I think it would be fine. He's the kind of puppy that needs a boy like Stevie, and I'm sure Stevie is the kind of boy that needs a puppy like Spot.\" When the door to Spot's cage was opened, there was no doubt about this. Spot gave one leap and was in Stevie's arms, and he cuddled there, licking Stevie's face, and wiggling with joy all the way home. As soon as the car was stopped, Stevie leaped out and went running to the house, Spot scrambling about in his arms. \"Mommy! Mommy!\" Stevie was yelling at the top of his voice, gay and noisy as he used to be, \"Come here. Come see Spot! Mommy!\" Janet looked at her father and he looked at her. \"Sometimes you wonder just what to do about things,\" she said, \"but if you think hard enough, there's always a way.\" Her father bent and kissed her. \"Do you know what, Sweetheart?\" he said softly, \"If they lined up all the little girls in the world, and all that ever will be in the world, and marched them past me, I know which one I'd pick. She's got freckles on her nose and her hair is the color of ripe sunshine\" Janet was so happy she could almost cry. Stevie was happy again, her daddy was happy again, and now she and Mommy could settle down to the serious business of getting things ready for the new baby. SLEEPING PUPPY Courtney E.

            "content": "On That First Morning Vesta P. Crawford \"And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.\"St. Mark 16:2. Where Jesus had been laid, there came, on a morning long ago, a great brightness. The glory of this light was seen by the three Marys and by others of them who loved the Lord. In the long centuries since that day the promise of life eternal has glowed with rainbow splendor against the darkness of the world. 'This promise has become the recurrent message of springtime, the everlasting strength of hope and courage. Through all the span of time since that first resurrection, millions of people have turned to the Holy Bible to renew the brightness of Easter morning. \"He is not here: for he is risen\"  so came the testament of the angel nearly two thousand years ago. So comes the message down the ages for people in every land to see the beacon light. For those who may have forgotten that the stone was rolled away, there is a hallowed surety in the simple words of the gospel narratives. John and Mark, Luke and Matthewthey tell the Easter story, each in his own way, each after the interpretation of -his own heart, as the life of the Savior had inspired him. F ROM the darkness of the tomb CLEARLY etched with vivid detail is the story told by John. He explains his purpose in words that have long been remembered: \"... That ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that Page 170 believing ye might have life through his name.\" John speaks of a garden that was near Calvary, and in that garden there was a new sepulchre. In this tomb the followers of Jesus laid His body. Even before it was light on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came into the garden and approached the tomb. The stone had been rolled away. \"Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.\" The disciples hurried to the tomb and found it empty. \"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.\" \"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping.\" 'Then she looked into the tomb and saw two angels sitting where Jesus had lain. The angels said unto Mary Magdalene \"Woman, why weepest thou?\" And she told them that they had taken away her Lord and she did not know where they had laid Him. Suddenly she saw Jesus standing near her, but at first she did not recognize Him. He spoke her name \"Mary!\" And she knew that the Savior had risen from the dead. Light glowed upon the dark stones and the springtime of hope came into the ON THAT FIRST MORNING garden. \"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord....\" In this, our time, when the very foundations of the earth are shaken, and the faith of many of us is tested by tragedy, is it not a quiet and precious thing to take a few moments from the rush of time to contemplate the testament of John? Now is a time for remembering that which has been written for our comfort and our surety. MARK tells the story of Christ's ministry in a series of word pictures etched with faith and understanding, etched with a splendor that has instructed the generations who have believed in the message of Easter. Mark has limned with graphic description an eternal picture of the resurrection. It is Mark who so beautifully portrays the coming of Joseph of Arimathaea, \"an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God\"how Joseph came to Calvary and took the body of Jesus and prepared it for burial. In a tomb hewn out of a rock Joseph laid his friend with love and care. Mark describes the coming of the Marys and the splendor of the angel's message... \"Be not affrighted:... He is risen; he is not here:\" - The appearance of Jesus to eleven of his disciples is presented in Mark's strong, direct words, and the command of Jesus is written... \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" And Jesus told his followers that they should \"speak with new tongues.\" It is, as Mark implies, the duty and the pleasure of those who believe the gospel 171 to spread the message of Easter to the far places of the world. Each gospel narrator tells with great emphasis that part of the story which most appeals to him, which seems the most inspiring, the most enduring. UKE, called \"the physician,\" was the companion of Paul on his second missionary journey, and it is he who stresses in his gospel the message of good news to all nations. \"It seemed good to me also,\" Luke said, \"having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee... That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.\" Every word of Luke's narrative is imbued with strength and meaning, as if he were writing upon granite, words to last throughout the coming ages, words to comfort the nations down along the path of history. Luke says that when the women saw the angels in shining garments standing against the dark rocks of the sepulchre, they were afraid and bowed their faces. In the solemnity of the garden with bleak Calvary rising up beyond the place, the angels spoke a message of eternal life: \"Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee.\"\nIt is Luke who gives the most vivid picture of the wonderful walk by evening unto a town called Emmaus. This is the event hallowed by many artists who have been inspired by this story of comfort at eventide. Hoffman, the great painter of the life of Christ, and many lesser artists\n172\nas well, portray this happening with spiritual insight, divining the inner glory of the farewell words of Jesus. The story of that walk along a path that led from Jerusalem to Emmaus is well remembered by all who have read the scriptural text. Two of the disciples walked by evening to this village, \"And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.\"\nThis significant event of the first Easter has been expressed in poetry:\nAt eventide when flowers closed And all the world was still, Two of them who loved the Lord Walked slowly up the hill; Beyond them in the valley They heard the Marys weep The path unto Emmaus town Was stony clad and steep; Then soundless was the silver night, No leaf stirred on its stem, Yet suddenly they heard a voice And Jesus walked with them.\nThe three travelers reached the village, but Jesus \"made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.\"\nFrom these words has come the great Christian hymn, \"Abide With Me.\"\nAbide with me! Fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!\nTHE words of Matthew glow with lasting simplicity. He alone of all the gospel writers tells how the stone was rolled away, how light came from darkness, the details of that first Easter. \"... As it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.\"\nSuch is the story of Easter as the disciples who lived in that far day have testified. In these precious words there is no faltering, no doubt, and no embellishment. In these words there is only simplicity, truth, and the promise of eternal life. No troubled years are long enough to dim the splendor of the message. Steadfast as spring, the promise returns and abides with us."

Crossing The River (Continued from page 178) velop, they now began to establish the comfortable pattern of life which they had left in Utah. These pioneers were coming to realize that their ideals had not changed because of privations, and that even when they were living in shanties and dirtroofed houses, the finer things of life were treasured and cultivated. Flowers were planted which bloomed. 'Throughout all the tragic troubles over water, the tea kettles in Arizona bubbled as blithely as ever they did in Utah. The friends who were bound into a oneness that day of the \"crossing,\" were ever the real friends. Always believing, finally they knew that Arizona was also Zion. An Arizona Temple had been promised, and was built. Human ingenuity and close spiritual ties built a bridge across the Colorado and a new and easier road to beloved Utah. Today one feels no terror in looking down that almost perpendicular canyon to the ribbon-like river far below. Its roar is faint, like an echo from the past. The Arizona of the pioneers is to its children and its children's children the \"land of heart's desire.\" Happily, lustily they sing her state song \"O Arizona, Sun-Kissed Land!\" Prayer for Relief Society \"We would hold up before thee, O Lord, the Relief Societies, with all their members; and all those who preside in their midst according to their callings and appointments, general or local.

Wilford Woodruff at Dedication of Salt Lake Temple Work -and- (Business New-fashioned Thrift Lesson 8 Preservation of Victory Garden Products (For optional use on Tuesday, May 11, 1943) HE thought of harvest and preservation of food is usually linked with autumnthe time when all the luscious, varicolored fruits and vegetables, brimful of vitamins and minerals, make such a definite appeal to the appetite. However, harvest time is not any One season in this country; our food crops are gathered the year round. But in spite of the continuous production, most small fruits and quick-ripening vegetables, such as strawberries, raspberries, peas, and asparagus are short lived and are seasonally found on the market. Because of this, and in order to have such foods in the daily diet, it is important to preserve them in such a way as to retain their natural flavor, form, and food value. Although many Victory Gardens were grown last year, there are indications that many more, on a much larger scale, will be grown during the coming season. In order that time, energy, and manpower will not be lost, every bit of the food produced should be utilized. 'That which is not used immediately, when fresh, should be preserved by storing, canning, drying, or freezing. Storing Some kinds of crops are better suited to storage than others. 'This should be kept in mind at the time of planting; but whatever kind is grown, its proper stage of maturity for successful storage must be considered. Underripe products shrivel and do not keep well, while overripe ones are usually inferior in quality. Vegetables and root crops when stored do not all require the same temperature nor humidity, and the storage periods differ. Beets, carrots, turnips, and similar vegetables keep best when stored at 32-36 F. With relative humidity of 85-95 per cent, and will keep four to five months. Squash and pumpkins require 40 F. With relative humidity of 50-70 per cent. Potatoes should be stored in a dark place with a relative humidity of 85-90 per cent, and keep best at 35-40 F. Higher temperatures cause them to sprout soon, and sometimes cause a decay in the center known as \"black heart.' Apples like a cool, moist atmosphere and will keep crisp and firm many months if properly stored. In preparing fruits and vegetables for storage, those with any kind of bruise, crack, or injury shoud be separated from the more perfect ones; defective ones should be used first and only firm ones stored permanently. There are several types of storage, and the kind best suited to your circumstances and needs should be used. Parsnips, carrots, and horseradish can be left in the ground all winter with a covering of straw, and dug or pulled as needed. Next to this type, the mound is the simplest form of storage. A layer of straw is Page 222 222 put on the area of ground needed, then the vegetables are piled on it in mound shape and covered with a layer of straw and then a layer of soil. The thickness of the covering will depend upon the severity of the weather in a given locality. A storage pit is made by digging a hole one to one and one-half feet deep and three to four feet wide. The pit is lined with straw, and the vegetables are piled into it in pyramid shape and covered with straw and soil. Freezing weather requires a thick layer of soil. Indoor cellars, if cool and ventilated, are good, but the modern, heated home with a cement basement is not so good for the storage of raw fruits and vegetables. Outdoor cellars are built on a more elaborate scale, and are used when it is planned to store large amounts of food products. Canning Canning is a type of food preservation used more extensively by house- wives than any other type. All kinds of fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, and fish can be preserved in this way. The methods which may be used are known as: open kettle, pressure cooker, water bath, steamer, and oven. To be perfectly safe, however, in canning non-acid vegetables and meats of all kinds, a pressure cooker should be used. In using a pressure cooker, instructions for its proper use and care should be studied carefully to prevent accidents and waste of food. A pressure cooker is as safe as any other piece of equipment and is easy to handle if a few precautions are taken. With the open kettle method, fruits are cooked in syrup until just tender, packed in sterile glass jars and sealed quickly and completely. Care must be taken with this method to prevent bacteria-laden air from getting into the jars when filled. 'The water bath method is used for fruits and tomatoes. With this method a kettle or wash boiler is used which has a tightly fitting lid and which is deep enough to permit covering the jars with two inches of water. A wooden or wire rack is fitted into the bottom of the kettle to keep the jars from breaking. The water is kept boiling during the entire process, otherwise, water from the boiler may replace some juice from the jars. The cooking period is counted from the time the water begins to boil vigorously. The steamer method is used for the same kind of products as the water bath. 'There must be a good circulation of steam to insure efficient sterilization of the products to be processed. A steamer may be made for the purpose, or the same equipment as that used for the water bath method may be used. Directions for operating the type of steamer used should be carefully followed. Oven method is recommended for berries and small fruits only, and should be used only when heat can be controlled. Peaches, pears, and other large fruits do not get sufficient sterilization with this method; a brownish discoloration often develops which does not always show up until the jars are opened. Drying Vegetables and fruits may be dried to remove sufficient moisture to prevent spoiling. Drying can be done at home in a dehydrator. Because fruit turns dark when cut or peeled, LESSON DEPARTMENT better results are obtained if this change can be brought about before the drying is done. Sulphuring or the use of a salt solution will help to accomplish this. The latter is easier when the drying is done at home, but it does not result in as good a finished product. In using this method the fruit is peeled, and then immersed in the solution (6 level tbs. Salt to 1 gal. Water). Fruit may also be dried without peeling. Non-acid vegetables and those which cannot be preserved by storing can be dried when a pressure cooker is not available. Freezing Like drying, freezing as a method of food preservation, especially for meats, was used in early days when no other method was available. But only within the last ten or twelve years has this method developed so that all the food values are retained and the products are like perfectly fresh ones. Quick freezing is not cold storage. In quick freezing the temperature. Is lowered so fast that the ice crystals do not enlarge and cut the delicate cell walls. When the products are defrosted, the original flavor and juices are still there. Not all foods, however, yield to this process in the same way, but as time goes on more foods are being successfully preserved by this method. So far, this is not a practical home process, but many housewives have access to community lockers and are learning to prepare their own products for freezing, or they pay a small 223 amount to have them prepared by a plant. Locker plants are mostly operated as a community project or by ice companies and meat dealers who rent space to their customers. Whichever process of preservation is used, the same care in the selection and preparation of the foods is necessary as though the foods were to be used immediately. Firm, wellmatured products should be carefully and quickly handled and thoroughly cleaned. All utensils, jars, caps, rubbers, and other containers must be perfectly sterilized. 'The time of the processing should be carefully calculated so the product will not be underdone or overdone. The careful storing of canned and dried foods is important. A cool, dark, dry atmosphere is best for food in glass containers. It is advisable to give foods dried in the sun a final heating in the oven to kill any microorganisms that might be present. Foods dried in a dehydrator will be free of any of these, but should be stored as soon as they are cool, in airtight cans, jars, or small paper bags. If dehydrated foods are put in cartons which hold only an amount sufficient for use at one time, then large amounts will not be disturbed nor exposed to the air unnecessarily. Note: Space will not permit detailed instructions on all the methods and procedures of preservation, but help and instructions may be obtained from the extension personnel of the various agricultural colleges. Every housewife should pre. Serve all the food that she can use.  There's Always A Way (Continued from page 207) He stood there, beseeching his father with his wide, blue eyes, and Mr. Allen and Janet could hardly bear it when two tears welled up and spilled down the cheeks they loved so dearly. \"Daddy! Can't Ihave Spot? He's _ all alone, and he doesn't want me to leave him!\" \"Spot?\" Mr. Allen pretended not to understand. Stevie nodded. \"He knew me as soon as I came into the room,\" he explained, \"And I knew him. He wants to be my dog, and I want him. The man said nobody else wants him. Please, Daddy?\" Mr. Allen climbed down from the car. \"Let's see about this,\" he said, and Janet hurried to follow them into the office again. \"Why, of course Stevie can have the puppy if he wants him,\" the man smiled. \"I think it would be fine. He's the kind of puppy that needs a boy like Stevie, and I'm sure Stevie is the kind of boy that needs a puppy like Spot.\" When the door to Spot's cage was opened, there was no doubt about this. Spot gave one leap and was in Stevie's arms, and he cuddled there, licking Stevie's face, and wiggling with joy all the way home. As soon as the car was stopped, Stevie leaped out and went running to the house, Spot scrambling about in his arms. \"Mommy! Mommy!\" Stevie was yelling at the top of his voice, gay and noisy as he used to be, \"Come here. Come see Spot! Mommy!\" Janet looked at her father and he looked at her. \"Sometimes you wonder just what to do about things,\" she said, \"but if you think hard enough, there's always a way.\" Her father bent and kissed her. \"Do you know what, Sweetheart?\" he said softly, \"If they lined up all the little girls in the world, and all that ever will be in the world, and marched them past me, I know which one I'd pick. She's got freckles on her nose and her hair is the color of ripe sunshine\" Janet was so happy she could almost cry. Stevie was happy again, her daddy was happy again, and now she and Mommy could settle down to the serious business of getting things ready for the new baby."

            "content": "Rachel Ridgway Ivins Grant APRIL 1943 Mary Grant Judd Member of Relief Society General Board NE who knew her well once () said of Rachel Ridgway Ivins Grant: \"In her presence one seems to feel the meaning of the word highbred in its truest sense. The fact seems perfectly clear that she came of a people that were refined and -cultured.\" Her Ivins progenitors, of English descent, came to the new world in 1690, and were among the earliest settlers of Long Island. It was in 1760 that they settled in New Jersey where they, as well as the Shreves from whom she was also descended, figured conspicuously in the history of New Jersey. It was in Hornerstown, New Jersey, that Rachel was born March, 1821. She was the sixth child and third daughter in the family of Caleb Ivins, Jr. (whose grandmother was a Shreve), and Edith Ridgway. Her grandfather, Caleb Ivins, had lived in Hornerstown all his life. History states: \"He was loved by all who knew him, many having christened' him 'the good Samaritan.' He owned a substantial brick and frame house and had a nice farm with a beautiful orchard in which chestnut, hickory, and walnut trees grew. He also owned a. Store, gob and sawmill.\" Rachel's father was a merchant. He died when she was but six years old; the lovely spirited mother following him in three short years. The children now became separated. Rachel living first with her grandfather on her mother's side (a kindly old gentleman who allowed her to do about as she pleased), and later with her cousin Joshua Wright and his wife, 'Theodosia. Theodosia, Joshua's wife, prided herself upon her immaculate housekeeping. No speck of dust was ever allowed to enter the sacred precincts of her home. The training received by the young girl unaccustomed to such rigidity must have been severe. \"Come back,\" the grandfather invited; and the children said, \"Such work belongs to the servants.\" But to them all Rachel answered, \"No.\" Young as she was, she realized that Page 227 228 the training she was receiving was for her good. She was naturally orderly, and now scrupulous cleanliness became second nature to her. At Theodosia's, Rachel's regular routine consisted of the bedroom work, and caring for the silver and glassware. These latter were never allowed to leave the dining room. To have taken these aristocrats of the table into the kitchen would have been a sacrilege. Rachel really enjoyed life at the home of her cousin Joshua, and though there were no other children there, she was not lonesome. Her naturally buoyant and happy disposition, which characterized her whole life no matter what her difficulties, stood her in good stead at this time. After the day's work was over she would go to a little grove of - trees nearby and there sit and sew for her dolls, singing contentedly all the while. It is easy to imagine her thus if one knew her in after life, for she always made the best of any situation. OME of Rachel's early history, including the incidents which led to her joining the Church and her fervent testimony of the gospel, have come down to us in her own words: My grandparents on both sides were Quakers, consequently I was brought up under that influence. But the silent worship of the Friends did not satisfy the cravings of my soul. I longed to hear the beautiful hymns that my mother taught to her little children even in: our tender years, and the spirit often moved me to burst out in songs of praise, and it was with difficulty that I could refrain from doing so. At the age of sixteen years with the consent of my relatives, I joined the Baptist Church. The singing pleased me and the prayers were somewhat inspiring, but the sermons were not much more satisfactory than the none-at-all of the Quakers. I was religiously inclined but not of the longfaced variety. I thought religion ought to make people 'happier and that was the kind of religion I was looking for. About this time we heard of some strange preachers called \"Mormons\" who had come to our neighborhood. I concluded they were some of the false prophets that the Bible speaks of and I had no desire to see or hear them. Her older sister Anna (mother of Anthony W. Ivins), had become converted to the new faith and persuaded Rachel, almost against her will, to go and hear them speak. I went to the meeting on Saturday but when she asked me to go on Sunday I did not know whether I ought to break the Sabbath day by going to hear them or not. But I finally went. Upon returning home I went to my room, knelt down and asked the Lord to forgive me for thus breaking the Sabbath day. I attended some more meetings and commenced reading the \"Book of Mormon,\" \"Voice of Warning\" 'and other works, and was soon convinced that they were true. A new light seemed to break upon me. The scriptures were plainer to my mind, and the light of the everlasting gospel began to illumine my soul. While thus investigating, a little child died whose mother had joined the Latter-day Saints. The Baptist minister took occasion to refer to the death of the little one, regretting that its parents had neglected to have it baptized, and that thereby it was lost and could not have. Salvation. I afterwards heard Elder Orson Hyde preach the funeral sermon. He portrayed the glories of our Father's kingdom and the saved condition of the little innocent ones who died before they came to years of accountability''For of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.\" The contrast was very great, showing one to be false and the other true. I was steadily being drawn to the gospel net. One day while attending the Baptist prayer meeting our pastor admonished me for the course I was taking and said if I RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT did not stop going to the Mormon meetings I could not hold my seat in the Baptist Church, and they would be obliged to disfellowship me for listening to false doctrines. This seemed to settle the question with me. One wanted to hold me against my convictions, and the other was free salvation, without money and without price. I soon handed in my name for baptism and rendered willing obedience to the first four requirements of the gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed through the Prophet Joseph in the last dispensation of the fulress of times. And oh, what joy filled my being! I could sing all the day long and rejoice in the glorious promises of the gospel. [' was at this time that Rachel met the Prophet Joseph Smith for the first time, as well as Jedediah M. Grant, her future husband. The \"spirit of gathering\" took possession of her, and in 1842 she went with her cousins, the Ivins, to Nauvoo. In this beautiful city Rachel made many friends. One of them, Emmeline B. Wells, who afterward became the fifth general president of Relief Society, gives this description of Rachel at this time: The writer has a faint remembrance of Miss Ivins as she first saw her in Nauvoo. She was dressed in silk with a handsome lace collar, or fichu, and an elegant shawl over her shoulders, and a long white lace veil thrown back over her simple straw bonnet. She carried an elaborate feather fan and now in thinking of fans, I recall the fascination of that fan. One could easily discern the subdued Quaker pride in her method of using it, for Sister Rachel had the air, the tone, and mannerisms of the Quakers. Rachel herself would never admit that she had been good looking. \"No, I was not a pretty girl,\" she told her granddaughters in later life. But they knew better. Such a handsome 229 old lady must have been a beautiful girl. It is probably true that she did not possess the doll-faced type of beauty. But in place of mere prettiness she had breeding, a fine carriage. She held her head high, not in false pride, but because she had been well-born and possessed a determined character. It is reported that when she became the wife of Jedediah M. Grant, one of the neighbors remarked, \"Brother Grant has married a queen.\" When she went to Nauvoo in 1842, it was natural that she should mingle in the social life of the city. She became well acquainted with the Prophet Joseph and has lft us this interesting description of him: I was many times at the Prophet's home. We used to have parties there. But not so many times when I saw him. He was a fine noble looking man. Always so neat. When he was preaching you could feel the influence and power. He was not at home very much. There were so few that he could trust or put confidence in. His life was so often sought that he had to be hid up. After he had been in hiding and had come out he was always so jolly and happy. He was different in that respect from Brother Hyrum, who was more sedate, more serious. Rachel tells us that her first year in Nauvoo was a very happy one, but that the second was not so peaceful. \"There were troublous times for the Saints, much persecution and _ turmoil.\"\" The turmoil grew more and more pronounced until it culminated in the terrible tragedy of the martyrdom of the Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Rachel was ill with a long siege of fever which left her in a weakened condition. This was a crucial period in her life. She felt very much alonc 230 and seems at this time to have had no definite idea as to just what course to pursue. She finally decided to go back to New Jersey. N New Jersey she lived with her brother's people. 'They treated her with indifferent kindness for they felt that in joining the Mormons she had disgraced the family name. Through this period of uncertainty, Rachel did not lose her testimony, she had been present in Nauvoo after the martyrdom when the mantle of Joseph Smith had fallen upon Brigham Young. She gives us this account of the incident: After the Prophet's death when Sidney Rigdon came to Nauvoo and spoke, he thought it was his right and privilege to be president of the Church. Brigham Young jumped right up on the seat and spoke. If you had had your eyes shut you would have thought it was the Prophet Joseph. In fact, he looked like himhis very countenance seemed to change and he spoke like him. At this time an indelible impression was made upon Rachel's mind which nothing could quite efface. And yet it is not improbable that, had she remained with her brother's family, their antagonistic attitude might have dimmed her faith, separated as she was from the Church leaders. ER sister Anna had married Israel Ivins, and in 1853 they decided to go to Utah. Rachel was invited to accompany them. What to do? To cast her lot with Anna meant a pioneer life to which she was entirely unaccustomed. Her financial resources consisted of only $100.00, which she had saved bit by bit. She hesitated at the thought of becoming an added burden on Israel who would have his hands full in caring for his wife, little daughter Caroline, and baby son Anthony. In addition, Rachel had been suffering from a severe cold which seemed to have fastened itself upon her permanently. Her doctor hinted at tuberculosis, several of the family being consumptive, and he now warned her that the trip across the plains might mean her life. To add to her uncertainty, her brothers did everything in their power to persuade her to remain in the East, even offering to settle upon her an annual income for life if she would renounce the hated religion of Mormonism. Rachel's problem was the same that has confronted thousands of converts to the faith of the Latterday Saints, and, like those others, she solved it only after prayerful consideration, deciding to cast her lot with the pioneers in the West. Once she had made up her mind she was as firm as the rock of Gibraltar. Nothing could make her turn back. She was to know sorrow and poverty, but the day never came when she regretted her choice. How momentous to her posterity this decision turned out to be! Rachel did not embark upon her new enterprise unprepared. With the hundred dollars she had saved she bought such cloth as calico, bleach, linsey-woolsey, and material for both cotton and woolen dresses, with thread to make them up. She purchased some ready-made clothing together with bedding, pillowcases, sheets, etc., and what she termed \"store things'necessary articles RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT which it was unlikely she could procure in Salt Lake. HE trip across the plains was surprisingly pleasant. It was seven years since the first pioneer companies had blazed the trail, and by 1853 when Israel Ivins took his family West, the journey had lost many of its hardships and hazards. Those who came later could profit by the experiences of their predecessors and besides, Israel was a man of sound judgment who did not risk the journey without thorough preparation. His equipment consisted of two well-stocked wagons, two yoke of oxen and a cow. One of the wagons was furnished almost like a room, having chairs and a bed. This made it very pleasant for the travelers, for, besides providing comfortable quarters at night, it permitted them to lie or sit down during the day if they chose. The wagon was equipped with steps at the back, and the deliberate pace of the oxen permitted the occupants, when tired of riding, to slip out and walk for a while. There was plenty of good, wholesome food for all. The faithful cow furnished whatever milk was needed by the grownups as well as the children. Cornmeal mush and milk was the usual supper, supplemented with cooked, dried fruit. These pioneers had never heard of carbohydrates, proteins, or minerals, yet here was a 231 well-balanced meal, served with that best of sauces, a perfect appetite. Rachel found herself enjoying life to the full. Sometimes she read, but not for long on account of the swaying of the wagon. She kept her knitting in her pocket and spent a great deal of her time in this useful occupation. She enjoyed the two children, who were very good, and would spend hours amusing baby Anthony or telling stories to little \"Caddie.\" OPTEN the company would travel till rather late. Then tired and hungry, they would camp when they came to some spot where water was available. While the women prepared the meal, Israel would unyoke his oxen and go to look for feed for them. Never would he eat until they were provided for. Often he would work until midnight getting everything in readiness for the start on the morrow and being sure that every comfort which this outdoor life could afford was provided for his family. 'True, Rachel was often weary, but untroubled sleep came to her at the end of the day. And while the exposure burned her face in spite of her faithful sunbonnet, and the hot winds dried and bleached her hair, she did not mind, for she felt herself growing stronger daily, until, at the end of the three (Continued on page 297) _> ERRATUM The committee on preparation of A Centenary of Relief Society takes this opportunity to correct a mistake found on page 35 of A Centenary of Relief Society.

And they saw \"the place where the Lord lay.\" The interrogatory: \"If a man die, shall he live again?\" was answered. \"For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so\" was \"'the Son of Man\" \"three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\" (Matt. 12:40) He was \"raised again the third day.\" \"And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into Page 232 the holy city, and appeared unto many.\" (Matt. 27:52, 53) OB knew that Jesus would come forth from the dead, and that he would see him face to face. Isaiah said that all the dead would arise with their bodies, and Daniel foretold a classification of them into everlasting happiness or contempt. And all of the prophets witnessed it. Jesus himself said that he would conquer death. Paul wrote: \"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then THE RESURRECTION cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.\" (I Cor. 15:12-26) HE doctrine of the resurrection was plainly understood in the Meridian of Time. Jesus said: \"But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.\" (Mark 14:28) To the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, he affirmed the correctness of the doctrine, and said that after the resurrection men could die no more, for they would be \"the children of the resurrection.\" The doctrine gives hope to all who love the Lord, for all men, whether good or bad, will be \"recompensed at the resurrection.\" But \"Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.\" (Luke 14:15) For esus said that all~ \"shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\" (John 5:29) Therefore, all good men have just cause to hope. But exact justice cannot be administered independent of God, for perfection is not found amongst men. In the resurrection it is different. All will have a true reward. God will administer justice there, and His judgment and His laws are perfect. His execution of penalties, and His rewards and punishments are perfect. Because He is perfect, all men may hope for perfect rewards, whether good or evil, in the resurrection. Strange 233 things reach the ears of administrators of earthly affairs, and emotions that are shaped and controlled by many forces and prejudices enter into judgments here. But perfection will reign supreme in the resurrection. Many who rule here will be ruled over, there. Some lords will be abased. The meek will possess the earth. There is great cause for the righteous to look forward with hope, and to rejoice. But the wicked will have reason to mourn. Victory is made sure through Christ. His death and resurrection make life a profitable enterprise. Without them, death would be permanent, but the atoning plan removes the sting of death. It robs the grave of permanency. It leaves death and hell empty of all who serve the Lord with whole hearts. That it might be so, God raised up Jesus, to turn the children of men from their iniquities. But they were grieved at His doctrines, and demanded that He be killed. However, God raised Him from the dead, and extended through Him His mercy to all men. And assurance thereof is given to all who listen to the truth. So \"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?\" (Acts 26:8) Many have suffered torture, and all manner of sorrow, and have denied themselves of every carnal pleasure, that they might have deliverance through a better resurrection. And they have blessed God, because of His abundant mercy, and have witnessed of Jesus, and have worshipped according to their highest knowledge,. That they might have part in the first resurrection. Upon 234 such the second death shall have no power, and their names will be found written in the book of life. \",. And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. 'This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.\" (Rev. 20:4-6) \"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.\" (Rev. 20:12-13) Now, the books that were opened were the Scriptures, as well as the records of the Church. The Scriptures contain the law that will judge the whole earth. And all facts and records of the Church -will be measured and judged by them. 'They contain the law pertaining to the whole plan of salvation. The peoples of the earth must answer to them in the day of judgment. And the people of all dispensations will be judged out of whatever Scriptures were available to their respective generations. And the book of life is God's record of all life. 'The names of all men whom He created were in it. But the names of many will be blotted out, because of sin. \"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\" (Rev. 20:15) As to death and hell, the prophets speak of the grave as death, and the place of the consigned spirit as hell. The grave (death) will deliver up the body, and hell will deliver up the spirit, and the two will be joined in the resurrection, never more to be separated. HEN Jesus was born into the world, it was a mighty peace proclamation. The angels heralded His coming with songs and joy. A new star appeared, and good will went out from the presence of God. But the resurrection was of a different nature. It is true that it was a necessary event precedent to the peace of the soul, but in another sense, it was a pronouncement of the world's greatest victory. It was the most spectacular thing that ever happened in the world. It was greater than the creation of the earth, and of the bringing of its elements together. Jewish priests, teachers, and rabbis represented the priestly order of that day. They interpreted and administered the ecclesiastical law. The priesthood of the whole earth was in their hands. Therefore, they represented the ecclesiastical law of the earth. And the seat of civil law and authority was at Rome. Rome's arms _ stretched far, and dominated many people. Both ecclesiastical and THE RESURRECTION civil authority of the Meridian of Time united in judgment against Jesus, and determined that He should die. They judged and pronounced sentence upon Him. And the whole force of wickedness was arrayed against Him. All evil opposed Him. Lucifer, who represented every evil force in the whole earth, concentrated all of his powers against Jesus. 'Thus, all wickedness, and all wicked men, were arrayed against Him. These united to destroy His life. They succeeded because He allowed it to be so. And He suffered death in the manner devised by them, being judged of men. The law could not restore Him alive, for death reigned supreme. But He triumphed over the ecclesiastical law; over their civil law; over Lucifer, and over all his powers; and over wicked men; and over death and hell; and over all things. He came forth triumphantly. It was a victory greater than all victories. It was a victory worthy of God. None but Jesus Christ could do it. THEREFORE, \"Why are ye troubled?\" and \"Why do thoughts arise in your hearts?\" Jesus Christ has atoned for all men, and for all life, and the vital fact of the resurrection is proved. 'The mercy of 235 Chirst has established life. He is \"the resurrection, and the life\" and \"he that believeth\" in Him, \"though he were dead, yet shall he live.\" And this probationary state is a time fixed for men to prepare to meet God, and to choose between the resurrections provided for them. It is the time to forsake all carnality, and to shake off the chains of sin. And all men ought to rejoice in Christ, without whom \"there could have been no redemption,\" nor any resurrection, therefore, no victory. But blessed are the dead who sleep in peace, for their redemption is sure, because of the merciful plan of our Creator, who prepared a way for our deliverance. Our hope is renewed, because of the power of the resurrection, and all things will be restored, but \"Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.\" (Alma 41:10) \"For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.\" (Alma 41:15) But all will come forth. \"If they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation.\" (III Nephi 26:5) +"

            "content": "Women and the Home Today Amy Brown Lyman General President of Relief Society The following talk was delivered by President Lyman over Radio Station KSL on Sunday evening March 14, 1943 during the Sunday Evening Church Broadcast, 9:15- 9:45 p. M. Sister Lyman was invited to deliver this talk by courtesy of the Church Radio Committee in recognition of the 101st birthday of Relief Society, March 17, 1943. NE hundred and one years 8) ago, March 17, 1943, the women's Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized. Today its members may be found in every state of the United States, in six continents, and in the islands of the sea in many nations, some of which are now opposed to one another in war. Nevertheless, these women are bound together by their common acceptance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and their membership in the Relief Society. 'Truly did Madame Chiang Kai-shek say in her recent historic speech to the Congress of the United States that \"devotion to common principles eliminates differences in race, and identity of ideals is the strongest possible solvent of racial dissimilarities.\" As the president of this international organization with its 115,000 members, I regard it as a great privilege as well as an outstanding honor to have this opportunity of speaking over the radio to our Relief Society workers, officers and members, and also to the multitude of others who listen to the messages of this regular Sunday evening broadcast of our Church. To our Relief Society members | extend greetings, and to them express appreciation for the great and unselfish contributions they are Page 236 making for the good of humanity in these troubled and anxious times, contributions not only to their own organization, but to their Church, to their communities, and to the various nations in which they are citizens. They are concerned both as individuals and as organized groups in the health and welfare of their communities, both in programs initiated by the Society itself, and by co-operating with other agencies, particularly in the fields of relief, food conservation (including canning and drying of fruits and vegetables), salvage, recreation for service men, sewing, and nursing services giving countless hours in volunteer work. And all this service they are - rendering in addition to performing their home duties; for Relief Society women are first of all homemakers and mothers. 'The noble spirits of these good women, their courage, and their work have impressed favorably, I am sure, all who know of the work they have done. What they have accomplished is truly amazing, and I am sure our Heavenly Father not only sanctions and approves their efforts, but for these unselfish efforts he will reward them richly. HE responsibilities and duties of women, always important and always great, seem greater today than they have ever been before. With the world involved in war and WOMEN AND THE HOME TODAY our customary manner of living disturbed and interfered with, new calls are constantly being made upon them. Women are expected to bear and bring up children, to care for the homes, to serve and to sacrifice, to help to keep up the morale of their families, of their communities, and of their country, and to help safeguard the emotional stability of the nation. 'They thoroughly sense the unusual needs and demands which have come in connection with this great struggle which has as its slated objective the obtaining of freedom for all mankind, and the establishment of peaceof a peace which can function and thus be more than a mere temporary truce. 'They therefore stand ready and willing to work and serve wherever duty calls. They strive under even the most trying conditions to help to keep up the general morale, to be calm, patient, and serene; and, as a group, to be a source of quiet fortitude and encouragement. They try to rise above their own personal anxieties and _ trials, and they do their utmost to sustain the courage of othersof husbands, brothers, sons, and even youths and children. Women are also willing to make sacrifices, -all those sacrifices which a nation may ask of its citizens in a time of common peril. In times of war the great sacrifice for women is sending forth their sons to the battle front. Those who create, always suffer greatly when the fruits of their creation are endangered or are in peril. The artist or the sculptor would be filled with anguish if, after months or years of continued painstaking effort, his masterpiece, in the form of a painting, a statue, or a marble carving, 237 should be mutilated or destroyed. The artist knows as no one else can know what each work of art has cost. He knows what long years of struggle and study it takes to actually produce, to create. Then what of the mother who produces life, who bears and brings up a son and then is called upon to have him, for his country, make the supreme sacrifice? She only, who has produced human life, knows the cost and the value of human life, and therefore she has unparalleled and profound reverence and regard for it. And what, too, of those other mothers, young wives who are left to rear their children singlehanded and alone? Other sacrifices, however great, whatever they are, such as the loss of property or other material things, or the loss of personal comforts, or the giving up of a life of comparative ease for one of hard laborall these are as nothing in comparison. And yet the love of country, the love of freedom and liberty, and the dedication to what they regard as duty, are causes for which women, the human childbearers, are. Willing to pay, even at the greatest of all costs. If things could be as women would have them, however, war as a means of arranging human differences would be abolished. They would settle such difficulties by arbitration and compensation. FYROM among the multiplicity of tasks which come to women today, we should choose wisely. It is extremely difficult and of some concern to know how to proceed, how to know which work is the most important, the most constructive, 238 which will really be most helpful, which will bring the most needed results. It is also difficult to know how much we can safely undertake and try to complete satisfactorily without detriment to our health, to our home life, and to the health and welfare of our children. We all desire to do our very best with the time at our disposal. We want to make the most of it. Each day comes but once, and each and every hour of every day we would like to use to the best advantage. We stand ready to do this with all the cnergies and powers at our command. The question, however, often arises, what shall we undertake to do and what may we profitably let remain undone? I am persuaded that we may let go many things which are of small consequence, many passing pleasures which have no permanent or eternal value. As new duties and responsibilities present themselves, these should be considered in the light of their relative importance one to another, and in the light of their relative importance when compared with the values of that regular routine work which must be done, and which many are now normally pursuing. Some women, such as mothers with little children, may be doing work both in the home and in the community, more prosaic but more important, helpful, and farreaching, in the long run, and more necessary even to the progress of the war and the peace to follow, than. Any kind of new work. Many are able, therefore, to add but little to their present burdens. 'Then on the other hand, there are many other women who are free to give practically full time to war efforts. All will agree that the first and most important duty of women is to keep the homes intact and the families together. 'The home, the basic institution of society, must be preserved. Not only should homes be kept intact for the sake of those left in the home, but also for the sake of the boys and men who are at the front. We are reminded constantly by military leaders that, from the military standpoint, homes should be properly maintained; that they are and will remain the greatest inspiration to the men in the service. Home is their chief topic of conversation. Then, as the givers and the guardians of life, it is the task of women in the midst of any and all exigencies and emergencies to bring up the generation of tomorrow. This is always a great responsibility for women, and especially so when they have to carry this burden alone. To the woman with young children, children of the ages requiring continual care and supervision, surely her first duty is toward them. This is her most important work, and the greatest contribution any mother can make to the world, either in time of peace or in time of war. It is especially important today that children be brought up in well-regulated homes, homes that run smoothly, homes where good standards, are maintained. System and regularity are the best preventives of emotional difficulties which often result, later on, in behavior problems, and juvenile delinquency. In all homes, and in all the adjustments which every home and family will have to make, children should receive full consideration. WOMEN AND THE HOME TODAY From the viewpoint of the Latterday Saints, the family is a sacred and holy institution and family life is the most important of all human relationships. This conclusion is based upon their belief in the pre-existence of man, in a life beyond the grave, in the immortality of the spirit, and in the eternal and everlasting union of husbands and wives and of parents and children. Latter-day Saints - believe that \"marriage is ordained of God... That the earth might answer the end of its creation; And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made\" (Doc. And Cov. 49:15-17); we believe and teach that marriage is a holy sacrament as well as a legal union, and that when marriage is consummated by proper authority in the House of the Lord it is \"for time and for all eternity.\" In the standards and plans for the Latter-day Saint home and for home life, children should be given the first consideration. Their health is to be guarded and careful provision is to be made for their schooling, their leisure, and their spiritual welfare. Rarely can a family be found in the Church in which the parents are not willing to make real sacrifices to educate their children, provide suitable recreation for them, and build up in them faith and such a love for the Gospel of the Master that these children, without financial remuneration, serve gladly as missionaries to spread the \"glad tidings.\" Belief in the immortality of the spirit affects all reactions in the Latter-day Saint home. When parents 239 look into the faces of their little children, believing that their spirits are immortal, that they will go on and progress eternally, there comes into the souls of parents a feeling of reverence for the life and personality of these little ones whom God has entrusted to their care; and parents are willing to forego personal pleasure, even endure severe trials, rather than to deprive these children of normal home life, or of whatever else may be necessary for their proper growth and development. Church members were greatly impressed by the message of the First Presidency of the Church given last October, in which they called attention to the duties and responsibilities of parents regarding their children. It has caused us all to pause and to review again our standards and ideals, our manner of living, and our obligations as parents and Church auxiliary workers. I will close these remarks with some quotations from this great message: By bringing these choice spirits to earth, each father and each mother assumes towards the tabernacled spirit and towards the Lord Himself... An obligation of the most sacred kind, because the fate of that spirit in the eternities to come, the blessings or punishments which shall await it in the hereafter, depend, in great part, upon the care, the teachings, the training which the parents shall give to that spirit. No parent can escape that obligation and that responsiblility, and for the proper meeting thereof, the Lord will hold us to a strict accountability. No loftier duty than this can be assumed by mortals. Motherhood thus becomes a holy calling, a sacred dedication for carrying out the Lord's plans, a consecration of devotion to the uprearing and fostering, the nurturing in body, mind, and spirit, of (Concluded on page 297)"

Obedience to this admonition will establish proper values and objectives for life's work, and will contribute to man's greatest joy and satisfaction. Keeping this counsel and demonstrating its fruits will aid others to obtain for themselves the same consequent blessings. Abiding by it will thus strengthen us and the Church and make for better living standards the world over. Compliance with it will provide salvation and exaltation in the life hereafter. The authorities, ancient and present, have stressed the necessity of our active affiliation with the Church and of the practical application of its doctrine in our lives. We are taught to \"remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,\" to \"go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day\"; that it is good to meet together often to renew our covenants and to study the Gospel; that we should bear our testimonies to each other often because that will strengthen our faith and make it easier to keep it, and to live as we should. The exhortations of the Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith and of all the leaders of the Church since then, resound in one chorusseek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened; keep the commandments and you Page 240 Shall know whether they are of God; the race is not to the swift nor to the strong but to them who endure to the end; keep close to the Church and the Lord will bless you with the strength of ten. 'The Gospel is God's plan of life and salvation for His family, the human family. The Church is His organization providing opportunities for its fulfillment. In the love and wisdom of an all-seeing Father, He has marked our course through life and back to our eternal home. His plan is so unlimited in scope and so marvelous in comprehension that it inspires mankind to hope, even for perfection. And His Church through the Priesthood, wards, stakes, missions, the Relief: Society, Sunday School, Primary, Mutuals, scouting, choirs, Genealogical Societies, and temple work, offers the means of achieving this glorious objective. THE past twenty years in Church, Government, and other work in Washington dealing with representatives of domestic and foreign industries, agriculture, labor, and governments of many nations has shown anew the great present value of the Church and has emphasized the mission it has to perform throughout the world. That mission, if possible, is even more vital now than heretofore. Present conditions would be quite different if just the homely and simple virtue of absolute and forthright honesty were KEEP CLOSE TO THE CHURCH 241 MEMBERS OF WASHINGTON STAKE IN MILITARY SERVICE HONORED Washington Stake Conference, September 1942. Center, left to right: President Oscar A. Kirkham, President Ezra T. Benson, and President Hugh B. Brown. Practiced among men. Open honesty that declared \"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,\" would make negotiating treaties, trade agreements, and all other international dealings easier - and the results more enduring. What a heaven on earth it would be if all the high standards of the Church were adhered to by mankind generally in all their relations with each other, and if men acted knowing that what they did, had not only a fleeting, but an eternal effect. Nearly ten years ago when President Heber J. Grant, both his counselors, and five members of the Quorum of the Twelve came to Washington to dedicate the new chapel they told us over and over again that they hoped we would make full use of it. \"Take good care of it, yes. It is new, bright, and lovely, and is beautifully furnished, but it was built and equipped to be used.\" Ever since the day of its opening, it has been used effectively in preaching the Gospel and keeping members active in the Church. Besides the full program of regular Church services as a ward and stake house, 180,000 visitors have come to the chapel to enjoy a restful hour of music and a conducted tour of the building, and have sent back word to their families and friends in all parts of the country. With the capital city mobilized for war, the 1600 242 SERVICE MEN ENTERTAINED, 1942 Home of Bishop and Sister Harold G, Clark tourists per month have given way to as many defense workers and temporary residents who turn to the \"Mormon Chapel\" for respite and new inspiration. A third of these guests remain for an hour or more in gospel conversation with the stake missionaries, while uncounted others come to Sunday services and M. I. A. To see \"Mormons-in-action.\" The fifty service men who find a restful night's lodging in the clean, airy gymnasium each Saturday night can attest to the building being used and its conventions respected. Elder D. Sterling Wheelwright, as organist, chapel director, and in charge of the Bureau of Information is, with his talented wife, doing a magnificent missionary service. Excepting the Salt Lake Tabernacle, organ, choir, and Temple grounds, this is the greatest center of missionary activities in the Church. Its influence is world-wide because of its character, and because it emanates from the Capital of the United States of America where are located diplomatic representatives of every important nation on earth. N recent years there has been a vast movement of members of the Church from the former center stakes in the valleys of the Rockies to hunt new opportunities in all parts of the United States, east, west, north and south, and to many foreign countries. Hundreds have come to Washington, D. C. To work in the Government, attend the universities, establish business, practice law, medicine, dentistry, teach school, be with their children, or' other loved ones, and for various other purposes. The membership in the Washington Ward is a regular moving cavalcade. It changes so rapidly that it is an exacting job to keep ward records up to date under such conditions. The genius of the Church is shown in the way it inspires members to give their time and do the necessary work to meet such problems. Because so many of those who come to the Nation's Capital have continued active in the Church, this group has grown from a mere handful, meeting in Senator Reed Smoot's home, to a good size stake of 3,000 menabert That whole period of change and growth is replete with evidence of the blessings that have come to those who have kept close to the Church. And now, during the past two years, thousands of our young men KEEP CLOSE TO THE CHURCH and women have joined the armed and auxiliary forces of our nation, and are to be found in all parts of the world where those forces are on duty, or training for activity in the various services. Hundreds of them have come to Washington and nearby areas. These young people are away from home, many of them for the first time. They are away from family and friends and from their familiar and stabilized Church and home-town social and economic conditions. They are often engaged in strange and unloved, and sometimes difficult and dangerous tasks that are necessary for the protection of our country and our way of life. These men and women especially should contact the Church at every possible point in their travels to partake of the sacrament and renew their covenants with the Lord. They will learn more of the Gospel, strengthen their faith, draw nearer to God, obtain courage to resist temptation, and become stronger in character and endurance to carry on under any and all conditions the vicissitudes of their tasks and living conditions. Many of the testimonies now borne in our Washington fast meetings are those of such visiting service men and women from nearby bases. Their thrilling, faith-promoting experiences, and their expressed need and love for keeping close to the Church is a tribute to the homes and wards all over the Church from which they come. A_ lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Corps, a member of the Church whose wife had been baptized during their few months stay in Washington, said conversions were not made through 243 prayer and study alone, but also by the warm friendliness which radiates through our churches and personal associations. A young marine paid great tribute to his brother's fidelity to the Church. He said in coming to Washington he was eager to find his brother, also in the service, who had expected to be here about that time. He had no means of knowing where to locate him, but he knew it he were here, when Sunday came he would find him at Sunday School. And so he did. These fine young men are all enlisted in teaching and appreciating 'the Restored Gospel as well as in the service of their country, and through prayer and right living they can keep close to the Lord wherever their service may take them. A COMMENDABLE practice of the families of the various wards of Washington, by arrangement of the stake military committee, is to invite all service men visiting the Washington Chapel Sunday School to have dinner in the homes. Many of these men find relatives and friends at Church; however, from six to twenty others each Sunday have dinner with families who have especially prepared for them. The men enjoy this respite from camp life and the host families enjoy having them, as is shown by this report of Sister Leah Ivins Cardon: It was a never-to-be-forgotten experience. From the time they entered our front door and our son burst into the kitchen exclaiming, \"Mom, let's do this every Sunday,\" until the last one left in the evening, it was a thrill. There were twenty of them, soldiers, sailors, and marines. To see them greet each other and us, to meet other Westerners, other 244 Mormons, people who knew their home country and perhaps knew some of their friends, brought a light to their faces which I shall never forget. And I agreed with my young son when he said, on one of his many trips to the kitchen to replenish the hot rolls plate, \"Mom, a religion that can produce a bunch of men like this has got something.\" I am looking forward to having them again, only next time I shall make ten dozen rolls instead of five, Each family entertaining also writes a note of greeting and appreciation to the parents of the men. The replies received from these anxious parents, happy in their sons being able to attend church and find home friends, would warm the heart of anyone. In this spirit of loving fellowship the work of God goes forward and men and women in all wards and branches are thus keeping close to the Church. EVEN in places where there are no Church organizations, we may enjoy religious blessings of a substantial character. Through secret prayer everyone may enjoy close and intimate communion with God and obtain the unrivalled fruits thereof. Members may send tithing to their bishops each pay day and keep the Word of Wisdom, and thus keep a very tangible association with the Church through compliance with these important commandments of the Lord. Think of our radio, telephone, telegraph, and mailing facilities for keeping close to the Church. In the days of our Savior, only those in the vicinity where He ministered even heard His name. Today, the sermons of His servants and our great Tabernacle organ and choir may be heard around the world. Church literature and the timely and inspired current messages of the First Presidency are readily available to even the remotest parts. Finally, there is no substitute nor alternative for keeping close to the Church and its teachings. It encompasses the real joys and satisfactions of life. May God help us to ever keep the Gospel standards before us in all our transactions with Him. And with our fellowmen, and help each to do his small part in building up His Church and Kingdom here upon the earth. G. And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day; 10. For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High; 11. Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times; 12. But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.Doctrine and Covenants, Section 59."

            "content": "He Lives! 'The Darkness Proclaims the Glory of Light\" Genet Bingham Dee N these dark days, days of terror | and anguish, should we not ask as did the Lamanites of old on one occasion, \"What shall we do that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?\" Will we not find the answer in the reply of a wise man among them: \"You must repent even until ye shall have faith in Christ; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.\" There is no book in all the world, it seems to me, that offers such solace for this our time, that teaches so eloquently the power and comfort of prayer, that teaches so definitely the love of God for all His children, that pleads so earnestly with those who stray to return to faith in Christ, as does the Book of Mormon. Yes, repentance is made almost joyful in this sacred book. In fact, this history of ancient Americans is largely a story of contrasts: pictures of the glory and joy of light, and the darkness and sorrow of sin. Two of the greatest stories of such vivid contrast are the accounts of the impenetrable darkness which proclaimed Christ's crucifixion at Jerusalem, and the sublime narrative of His visit to the Nephites. Both stories are simple, brief, dramatic. The Witness of the Elements in Chaos THIRTY-THREE years had passed away since a new star of brilliance and glory and other \"great lights and many signs and wonders in the heavens\" proclaimed the birth of the Christ in Bethlehem. And now the elements in chaos proclaimed that man had slain Him, \"Christ, the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and of earth, the. Creator of all things from the beginning.\" The signs of His death had been predicted by Samuel the Lamanite Prophet. But sin was rampant in the land. The prophets were scorned, many of them slain. And, lo, suddenly, \"in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month,\" into their confusion and doubt the signs came, all of them as the prophets had foretold, the signs of the death of the Savior of the world in faraway Jerusalem. A storm broke, \"such an one as never had been known in all the land.\" Thunderings, lightnings, tempests! The very earth shook and trembled. Rocks were \"rent in twain\" both above and beneath the earth. Mountains were \"laid low like unto valleys.\" Valleys became mountains. The great city of Zarahemla and many other great and notable cities were burned. The City of Moroni sank into the depths of the sea; \"the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah that in the place of the city there became a great mountain.\" 5 There was devastation unfathomable throughout the land, \"great and Page 245 246 terrible destruction.\" The face of the whole land was changed because of the tempest and the whirlwinds and the thunderings and the lightnings and the exceeding great quaking of the whole earth. Many cities were levelled by earthquake, \"the inhabitants thereof were slain and the places were left desolate... Some were carried away in the whirlwind; and whither they went no man knoweth....\" Finally \"the thunderings, and the lightnings and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did ceasefor behold... All these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours.\" It was said by some that the time was greater. Small wonder that the time seemed greater. A few seconds of such terrifying chaos might well seem like an eternity to those who lived through it. It is difficult even to imagine the tumult and the noise. Not only were the buildings, high towers, and walls of the cities being crashed to the ground by the angry elements; but the earth itself was creaking and trembling in its very foundations. What an implacable foe those elements became, as God vented the wrath of His judgment upon those disobedient ones, according to the decrees which He had made! The Testimony of Utter Darkness ERHAPS only once in the history of the world has there been such complete and impenetrable darkness as enveloped the American Continent following the storm's devastation. 'That time would be in the beginning when \"darkness was upon the face of the deep\" before God said, Let there be light,\" before He \"placed the lights in the firmament of the -heaven to give light upon the earth.\" \"... Then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land.... There was thick darkness upon all the face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen could feel the vapor of darkness; And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any light at all. \"And there was not any light seen, - neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land. And it... Did last for the space of THREE DAYS that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.\" Jerusalem was enveloped in darkness for but three hours at the time of the crucifixion. Why three days of darkness upon this continerit? Was it not a special blessing, a way of compelling the Nephites to repent? And they did repent. \"And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day.\" \"And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers HE LIVES! And our fair daughters and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great city, Moronihah!\" The Warning Voice 6 AND it came to pass that there ' was a voice heard among all the inhabitants of the earth, upon all the face of this land, crying: Wo, wo, wo unto this people; Wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and abominations that they are fallen!\" The Voice from heaven recounted some of the great cities which had been destroyed as punishment for sin, naming sixteen in all. And they were destroyed in the space of three hours! Then the Warning Voice became one of mercy and of pleading: \"O all ye that are spared...\" came the gentle message, \"will ye not now teturn unto me,... That I may heal you?... Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me. \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; And in me hath the Father glorified his name.\" The Silence AFTER the people heard the words of Jesus there was silence in the land for the space of many 247 hours, so great was their astonishment. But the darkness continued, the great blanket of darkness, so dense that the people could feel the vapor of darkness until three days had passed away. Light After Darkness 66 ANP it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.\" The mourning of the people \"was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeem- 3? Er. The Risen Lord Appears A GREAT multitude of Nephites had gathered about the temple in the Land Bountiful. No doubt they had come for comfort to this House of the Lord. They were marvelling about \"the great and marvelous change which had taken place. And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death.... They heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless... It did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn. \"And... Again they heard the voice, and they understood it not. 248 \"And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly toward heaven, from whence the sound came. And behold the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them: \"Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my namehear ye him. \"And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; \" and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant,' for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them. \"And he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying: \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. \"And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning. \"And... When Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.\" To Dispel All Doubt ANP \"the Lord spake unto them saying: \"Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world. \"And... The multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come. \"And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying: \"Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.\" AT this Easter Season we do worship at His feet. Now when the unrighteous have plunged the world into war, and our land and our loved ones are in danger, we look to Him, the source of peace and light, with the assurance that He will bear us up \"upon the wings of His Spirit.\" God grant that our burdens may be light through the joy of His Son. Then even from the sadness of our hearts we shall find peace through the love of Him who said: \"I am the light and the life of the world.\""

            "content": "The Lion House Rachel G. Taylor FAMILY tradition says that Brigham Young's remembrance of the many-gabled windows of a white house in Vermont was the inspiration for the Lion House. His brother-in-law, Truman O. Angell, was the architect, but Brigham Young's training as a cabinetmaker and builder were definitely shown in many details of his new home. The exact date of the completion of the Lion House was not recorded. The pioneers were so busy doing things, that slight attention was given to writing about them. From Truman O. Angell's journal it would appear that the work was commenced in 1854. (Apparently the Bee Hive House was being finished at this time.) He writes: July 10, 1854I have been very busy with the various duties obligatory on me as an architect what time my health permits. My present work is on the details of President Young's large new house but I have to be posted upon many other jobs such as the sugar factory, President Young's old house that was carried up last fall, etc. August 10th, 1854Since my last sketching I have been busy on various plans, one for the President's big house... August 27th, 1854I have just made out details for finishing the president's big house. April 2, 1855Since March 16th finished East elevation of Temple, designed front elevation of President Young's big house, which was drawn by William W. Ward. May 8, 1855I am now preparing to go south with the President on his annual trip to the settlements. While I am gone Brother William W. Ward will keep a journal and insert it here of the proceedings with the business of the office. I have EARLY VIEW OF LION HOUSE charged him with the finishing of the flagging of the President's porch, also setting the steps and also making the handrail. December 29th, 1855-I made out several parts of finish to be erected in the President's big house that will show for itself in a few days. HE style followed the pattern of early English mansions. The first of the three stories was built of large sandstone blocks. The other two of sun-baked Mormon adobe. The roof was shingled and had six towering double chimneys to take care of the stoves and many open fireplaces throughout the interior of the building. ) Page 249 250 The home received its name from the lion on its vestibule roof. Of this lion there is the following item in the Millennial Star of January 26, 1856: A stone lion of the size of life, most beautifully and correctly sculptured by Brother William Ward, has been elevated to its position on the battlement porch at the south end of President Young's large family dwelling. The walls, inside as well as out, were made twenty-three inches thick. The joists for the basement floors were straight pine poles about six inches in diameter. 'Twenty dormer windows, ten on each side, were among its most distinctive features. The face of the adobe walls was plastered smoothly and given a coat of light whitewash, adding dignity to the building. There were small panes of glass in all the windows. An observant visitor may still distinguish pioneer made \"wavy panes,\" which have survived the years. When the original green shutters, so distinctive of colonial houses, wore out, they were discarded, but recently they have been restored. The crumbling plaster on adobe walls was later replaced with a veneer of cement blocks, adding to the stability, but materially detracting from the beauty of the house. The plan on the inside had a aime acter all its own. On each floor there was a long hall running the entire length of the building. The main and upper halls each had two glasspaned partitions with a door in the center. This conserved heat and also was pleasing to the eye. Before the days of gas and electricity, two rows of brackets with oil lamps ran down the hall and lighted its shadowy length. THERE were forty rooms in the home. On the upper floor leading from the hall were twenty rooms, four with two windows, the other sixteen each with a side dormer window. Many of the rooms had fireplaces. Later some of the rooms had Franklin stoves. Bedrooms without stoves were heated with a stovepipe crossing its width near the ceiling. On the main floor the parlor and nine private living rooms branched from the hall. The lower floor hall had doors leading to the family dining room, the pantry, kitchen, laundry, school room, bathroom, milk room, weaving room, and two large stone-tiled rooms, used for cellar and vegetable storage. A hall to the east led out into the court, where first the well, and later the pump, furnished the water for family use. Through many passing years, widely varied activities have been carried on in this outstanding edifice. First it served the purpose for which it was erected, it was a beloved home for Brigham Young and many of his wives and children. An item in the Journal History, Dec. 24, 1856, tells of a party in December of the year the Lion House was completed President Brigham Young gave an entertainment in his new residence the \"Lion House\" on Christmas evening to the large number of the missionaries returned from foreign missions and a few other brethren with their wives. THE LION HOUSE 251 VIEW OF PARLOR OF LION HOUSE Showing original cupboards and table made for Brigham Young Soon after the company assembled the President expressed gratitude at being able to comfortably entertain so goodly a party, most cordially greeted all with a fatherly welcome and invited them to enjoy themselves with singing and conversation, or with praying and preaching as might seem to them good and remarked as he often does, in inviting guests to a party, the only limitation to number, in his feelings, was the extent of room for their accommodation, hence had he a suitable room, he would never wish to stop until he had invited every Latter-day Saint in all the world. Later some of the east rooms on the main floor were used for Church office purposes. In 1900 the building was purchased by the Church and became a part of the L. D. S. University. In 1931, when all departments of the school, except the Business College, were discontinued, the Presidency of the Y. W. M. I. A. Made a request that they be allowed to use it as a social center for girls and women. And in Dec. 1931, the request was granted. The last ten years have seen this outstanding product of pioneer building once more invested with the spirit and charm of a hospitable community home. The late Harrison R. Merrill sensed the new mission of the home when he wrote: As the visitor walks up the few steps and pushes open the beautiful handmade door and stands in the dimly lighted hall, if he is one who is prone to honor and reverence the past as being prophetic of the future, he cannot help feel that he is in a building which was once home to a very great man. In fact he is likely to call it the Mt. Vernon of the West, for here the father of the Wilderness, also a home lover, a believer in the soil and in the common man, lived and died. 252 As he tiptoes into the famous parlor which has served as reception room for many of the greatest men of the world, and stands there in the presence of the spirit of Brigham Young, the colonizer, the statesman, the empire builder, he can be excused for dreaming fine dreams of what the Lion House Social Center is to mean to thousands and thousands of girls and women. He can there feel the very spirit of the place which breathes warmly though softly the words, \"Welcome, come in and make yourself at home.\" This old parlor with its deep-set windows and expertly finished wall cabinets is a homey room. It is the place where the family gathered for prayers, where social gatherings were held, and where young men, courted their sweethearts.: The skillfully grained cherrypainted woodwork, with its gold band trim, is the same as when the house was finished in 1856. Around the room are comfortable wooden chairs, exact copies of the ones made. For this spot by the \"Public Work ShopsGreat Salt Lake City.\" A Harwood painting of the family farm, now Liberty Park, a duplicate of one of Brigham Young's couches, and his beautifully carved mahogany center table lends the atmosphere of his day to this interesting parlor. The Journal History, Jan. 6, 1859 relates:. He (President Young) then took the brethren into the Lion House parlor, 32 feet long and 16 feet wide, showed them two center tables made of solid mahogany, made in this city. When Thomas S. Williams was cutting his great wall, he brought from the states a log of mahogany about 14 inches through. Williams and Hooper insisted that Governor Young should take it; the tables were made by William Bell and they are superb specimens of workmanship. He also showed them a looking glass which he said Wil-  liams and Hooper had sold him with its mate. They bought them for their own use, and when they smashed up they prevailed on the President to buy them, their cost in the states were $100 each. The President gave a wild breeding mare for them. He also showed them a piano and said eight of his girls under eleven years of age had learned to play on it. He said he had another in the Bee Hive Mansion. The Pesident remarked that last year when the army was coming up the Platte the officers fully expected to make their headquarters in the Lion House and that now he had forty children in it under 13 years of age and altogether seventy-five persons. Nearly a dozen little cherubs were in the parlor studying their lessons when the brethren entered. The room through the doorway to the north also has the original painted woodwork representing oak, with the graining so typical of the best buildings of that period. Here is found an old-fashioned fireplace, one of the many that was originally built in the house. In the Pioneer room at the far end of the hall, one feels the atmosphere of bygone days. Two layers of modern hardwood flooring that covered the original floor have been removed, and varied widths of pine flooring, their color mellowed by age, form an appropriate background for the circular ivory and rose braided tugs. 'The blue tinted walls and matching paint on woodwork, the wax fruit under a towering crystal dome, duplicates of Brigham Young's couches and chairs, and his gold muffler, with gay rose and blue tulips framed on the wall, make this room a joy to lovers of pioneer handicraft. There are two memorial rooms on the main floor. It is appropriate that these rooms should contain many interesting relics belonging to THE LION HOUSE Brigham Young and his immediate family. It was in the larger of these two rooms that President Young died. His daughter Zina wrote of his passing, \"the canopy bed he occupied... Was placed before the window where he could get the air and his loved ones be around him.\" History tells us that a throng of anxious saints waited night as well as day in the court outside his bedroom window. When they heard the words \"He is gone,\" slowly and reverently, with grief-stricken hearts, they ended their long vigil. In this room are his clothes, his cape and shawl, dishes from the Governor's dinner set, a_ table, couch, and chairs originally used in the house. Here is an exquisite chenille shawl, and also dresses, shoes, and fans belonging to his wives and daughters. Of children's toys there is a set of three little rocking chairs, and a charming wax doll. On the top floor there still remains a room the size of the twenty original ones, two of the old fireplaces, and the inside detail of the many-gabled windows. A south door leads out onto the battlement porch where the famed stone lion has. Rested for nearly a century. A visit to the house is not complete unless one goes to the lower floor where kitchens, laundry, weaving, provision, and the large dining room were located. All this space is now occupied by the Center cafeteria, with its six dining rooms. The most interesting of these are the ones converted from the old provision cellars. Taking up a worn-out, musty wooden floor disclosed the original flagstones. The walls show the size 253 ONE OF THE TWENTY DORMER WINDOWS and type of stone and adobe used in the construction of the building. Copies of pioneer tables and rush bottom chairs complete this unusual setting. The building adjoining the Lion House on the east housed the offices of the presidents of the Church and served as territorial headquarters when Brigham Young was governer. This building is now a part of the Social Center. These rooms are among the most interesting to the thousands of tourists who are conducted through the center each year by volunteer guides. The balcony room with its cupboard staircase, oil painted facsimile.  VIEW OF TWO MEMORIAL ROOMS Showing one corner of the room in which Brigham Young died, and on into farther room where dresses worn by members of his family are on display. Of office documents tucked in tiny pigeonholes, its golden-toned desks with scroll saw decorations makes a most interesting spot. * * * Time has been kind to the Lion House. Its quaint touches of another century's beauty blend harmoniously with the happy activities it houses. Brigham Young was a man of vision, building for the future. It is fitting that the Retrenchment Association, organized by him in the Lion House parlor, should grow into the Young Woman's Mutual Improvement Association with a membership of over 82,000, whose executives seek to carry the spirit of his hospitality and high standards to all who enter the doors of his home, the Lion House. Study order and cleanliness in your various occupations. Adorn your city and neighborhood. Make your homes lovely, and adorn your hearts with the grace of God. 8:297.Discourses of Brigham Young, page 310."

            "content": "The Gardener's Best and Oldest Friend Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, The Deseret News WHEN Adam, the world's first gardener, was driven out of that first perfect garden, he was told that henceforth the earth should bring forth thorns and thistles, and that his part forever after should be to till the soil. Few modern gardeners connect those ancient and beautiful words with their own 1943 Victory Gardens. Surely, exclaims the amateur, we have now progressed, with all our modern tools and gadgets, our balanced fertilizers and high-class varieties, beyond such primitive methods of making plants grow! Yet that ancient command to till the soil is as important today as it was in the days of Adam, and especially is it important in raising a Victory Garden of vegetables. Call it tilling, or cultivating, or stirring, or just plain hoeing... Here is the open sesame and the royal road to achieving a successful and abundant garden. How strange that it usually requires experience plus a few failures to teach the amateur garden-maker that the hoe (or its twin-tool, the three-pronged cultivator), is truly the gardener's best friend. \"The more we hoe, the more we grow,\" runs an old adage quoted for years and years by both farmers and gardeners, yet the beginner is inclined to pin his faith on some highpower nostrum or pill, some magical vitamin wand, claimed to make the garden rows prosper and thrive with little or no effort on the gardener's part. Cultivation of the soil is vitally important if we wish to realize all those pleasant expectations of bumper crops, of luscious tomatoes that rival those pictured on the first page of the catalogues, of tender, sweet peas and carrots, beets, and other succulent eatables. We must learn to use this old and trusty weapon with a will and with persistence if we would have a garden of which we can be proud. We must cultivate early and late, often, and then repeat the process, in fact, we cannot overdo this ageold practice of stirring and tilling the soil about our plants if we wish them to prosper and flourish. Few indeed are the plants that do not welcome and appreciate good cultivation. The queen of all flowers, the rose, must have it in order to produce her best. The trees show their appreciation of an occasional good cultivation by bearing better foliage or fruit. Even the tiniest seedling will hold up its head, and take heart, and set to work to grow up, if it is encouraged by having the surrounding soil stirred gently to let in air and to stimulate its growth. MAKE plans to cultivate your vegetables as soon as the seeds pop up and can be seen in a row. Use a small hoe, often called a Warren Page 255 256 Heart-shaped hoe, or the efficient three-pronged cultivator, or if your vegetable garden is large enough to justify the expense, purchase the ingenious wheelhoe, a small contraption mounted on a wheel and pushed along like a plow. You can even use the common regular garden hoe. The important thing is to stir and till the soil, just as gardeners have done since the beginning of time. This first early cultivation of the soil is of greatest importance, not only for the stimulation it gives the plants, but also the millions, of weeds it will destroy. The earth is full of weed seeds, all waiting and ready to begin to grow, and these interlopers often sprout even before the vegetable seeds, for they are moist and ready to burst. We must catch them as soon as possible without disturbing the legitimate seeds. So this first stirring of the soil should be made just as soon as the row of seeds can be discerned, even though there are no weeds. Kill the pirate weeds even before they germinate by keeping the surface loose and well worked, and you will be saving yourself hours and hours of future hard weeding. Hoeing makes the ground sweet and lets in air, so that roots are stimulated and crops are thus much sooner brought to maturity and perfection. And strange as it may seem, by keeping the surface open, loose, and porous, we prevent the parching effects of drought. We can do much to allay the effects of lack of moisture by constant cultivation. A welltilled garden will show little effects of lack of moisture, while one which does not have cultivation will suffer, 1943 badly, even though it has been fertilized more heavily. HE ground which is constantly watered soon becomes packed and hard, unless the surface receives tilling or cultivating. And when it reaches this forbidding state then neither. Moisture nor air can reach down to the feeding roots. \"Frequent cultivation is of more importance than either moisture or fertilization,\" says one of the finest growers of prize roses in our state, and she proves her point by the fresh, abundant, and sparkling flower beds, and the wonderful flowers, fruits, and vegetables her garden produces. This talented gardener cultivates after every watering and rainfall. Her vegetable rows are cultivated often and frequently, until the leaves are so large that they shade and protect the surface from the sun's rays, and thus the earth is kept from packing and becoming hard. Tomatoes especially need plenty of stirring of the soil, in fact one can scarcely overdo tilling all vegetable crops. And by beginning early, and keeping the surface well-worked, the weeds can be almost completely conquered before they have a chance to grow. Only the few that lodge directly in the vegetable rows themselves, need be actually pulled up. Save yourself hours and hours of hard grueling weeding by keeping the surface in good tilth. Yes, we must still observe that ancient command, given to Father Adam the first gardener, if we would have a garden of which we can be proud, and strange to say, when once we learn that this personal effort is required of us, we too respond to"

And as our gardens put out rich growth and show signs of abundant, maturing crops, we achieve a peace, a serenity, and a sure contentment. No matter what the crop, be it 257 roses or cabbages, the gardenmaker who tends and ministers to his plants in this age-old fashion, receives a certain deep and abiding reward, a gain which is physical, spiritual, and mental, such as the casual gardener seldom knows. SONG OF SPRING Mabel Jones Gabbott Today it's spring, and in my soul I know God lives. Today I know, I did not doubt when autumn winds Swept bare my trees. When sleeping winter's frost Lay at. My door, I kept my faith. But when, today, spring's greening figures Touched my heart and beckoned me To frolic in the pale new sun, I longed to shout: \"He lives, I know He lives. I know. I know.\" His smile has touched the tiny shoots That struggle through the cool rich earth, To stretch their yellow heads towards the sun, And drink of green ambrosial strength. His love has summoned every bluebird's song, And turned the robin's merry note To happiness and joy. His tenderness has lingered in my apple tree And wakened dormant buds to fragrant life. His understanding cheer, has called The little children forth in happy glee To drink the fresh spring air, And toss their ropes, and play their games. His goodness fills my soul. I stand in silence, worshipfully still. In spring, God seems so near. And all within my little world is right."

Sister Richards is unusually well and active for her years, and her remarkable memory recalls important events in the life of Utah for many decades. She was called to assume the editorship of the Woman's Exponent when in her early twenties, and she faithfully performed this work until home ties prevented the continuance of her editorial duties in 1877, after serving for five years. Very recently the accomplishments of Sister Richards were recognized when she was selected by the Salt Lake City Council of Women to be one of the seven women elected to their Hall of Fame. The Magazine is pleased to publish \"For the Elect's Sake,\" one of her later poems. \"FOR THE ELECT'S SAKE\" Matthew, 24th Chapter, 22nd Verse Lula Greene Richards Oh hasten! Ye hours and days yet to be Ere from dark sin and sorrow our world shall be free. The time seems now on by the Christ's words engraved, When \"Except days were shortened no flesh should be saved We sense the time speeding, while near and afar All the world seems convulsed with the spirit of war. Bombardment lays cities and nations all waste, The Designer of Evil works surely in haste. Death, famine, disaster, exulting reign, With air, lands, and seas all surcharged with the slain. \"But for the Elect's sake\"the Savior spake on, That the minds of His friends from despair might be drawn \"Those days shall be shortened.\" Oh, promise divine!

            "content": "Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon A VERY commendable movement has been started in Ferron, Emery Co., Utah, which might well spread to other parts of the country. So many of the inhabitants of Ferron have moved away to engage in war industries that sixty homes and orchards have been left vacant. Mrs. Amy Greenhalgh, a public-spirited citizen of that town, organized a club, \"The Vacant Home Vanguard,\" among the boys. The city was divided into four sections, and each section placed under the charge of a group of boys to look after the vacant property and try to care for and protect the fruit trees. Mrs. Greenhalgh herself has now moved away, but is striving to interest other people in this very worthwhile movement, and is especially anxious for the mothers of the boys to encourage them in this fine undertaking. Don Hansen, 14, is the leader of the boys. Louise Anderson, a WAAC, attended the famed Casablanca conference. Princess Elizabeth of England, heir apparent to the throne, will be seventeen years old April 21. The third daughter of Princess Juliana, heir apparent to the Dutch throne, is the first royal child to be born in North America. Canada welcomed the little princess. So There, the book of charming children's poems by' Mrs. Vilate Raile of Salt Lake City, is winning much acclaim. Children themselves suggested many of the subjectsa spider, duck, a bee folded in a hollyhock. The illustrations by Mildred Dickeman are also delightful. LORD CHESTERFIELD, famous for conventional politeness, wrote to his son in 1748: Women are to be regarded only as children of a larger growth; they have an entertaining tattle and sometimes wit; but for solid reasoning good sense, I never in my life knew one that possessed it. A man of sense humors and flatters them, but he neither consults about, nor trusts them with serious matters.... They love to be dabbling in business, which, by the way, they always spoil. That was in the day when all powerful man patterned woman's design for living. We hope that Chesterfield's shade looked down upon Madame Chiang Kai-shek addressing Congress in Washington, and was duly apologetic. Flower of modern womanhood that has developed in a more liberal age, Madame Chiang displayed a logical and exquisitely cultivated mind, a statesmanlike attitude, and moving eloquence. After Japan's inhuman cruelty to China for five and onehalf years it was magnificently Christian of Madame Chiang to plead that future peace be without punishment for the conquered peoples.

            "content": "Love One Another 4 TODAY when the hearts of so many of the inhabitants of the earth are filled with hatred for their fellow men, and Satan is going to and fro seeking whom he may destroy, it is a time when we, as Latterday Saints, should study and consider the sacrifice of the Savior, and through reading of Him and praying to the Father in His name, should fill our souls with love of Christ and thus continue and increase in our love for one another. We are filled with wonder as we contemplate the words of the Savior during His last hours. It is a merciful part of the great eternal plan that the events of the future lie hidden from man, however in the case of the Savior, we know that while on this earth He was aware of the eternal plan and of His major role in it: first as it was formed in the pre-existence; then as to the part He was to fulfill in mortality as the Savior of the world; and last as to His reunion with the Father after passing from this earth and the glory and work that would be His with the Father. Words, and actions at the Last Supper and thereafter were all for the fulfilling of His mission, of glorifying the Father, and of strengthening and instructing His faithful disciples that the Gospel might be established after His death. His soul was filled with love for these faithful few. Page 260 Yet His thoughts,. In the introduction of John to the events of the Last Supper we read: Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. What feelings Christ must have experienced at the Last Supper as He looked around the table! He was about to leave these most beloved apostles whom the Father had given Him out of the world.... He said unto them, \"With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.\" He washed the feet of the disciples, and after indicating that Judas would be the one to betray Him, He said to him, \"That thou doest, do quickly. He (Judas) then... Went immediately out: and it was night.\" After Judas left, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him... A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. In His final beautiful discourses and in the prayer of Christ unto His Father, again and again are two statements repeated: \"That ye love one another,\" and \"If ye love me, keep my commandments.\" EDITORIAL As Jesus, in His divinity, suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane for the sins of the world beyond the power of human endurance: \"being in agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground,\" so he loved beyond human power. Although facing \"an excruciating death upon the cross\" and knowing that the time was fast approaching, still His final discourses to His faithful followers were solely concerned with their welfare following His death. He poured out His soul to the Father in their behalf and He warned and exhorted them as to their future course when He would be with them no mote. \"He loved them unto the end.\" He knew that He would be betrayed; He knew Peter would thrice deny Him; He knew His disciples would sleep through His agony; He knew He would be deserted by some of 261 them at the cross; He knew they would not accept the fact of His resurrection until it was proved to them; He knew all their failings and weaknessesbut \"He loved them unto the end.\" He loves all His disciples unto the end, in whatever dispensation they have lived. He loves us in this day who have embraced the fullness of the Gospel, in spite of our failings and weaknesses; but we must heed his \"new commandment,\" as did the disciples of old, the commandment which has come down to us of this day, \"This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.\" ' There is no place in the heart of a true Latter-day Saint for hatred. It is our duty, our responsibility, and our salvation, \"to love one another as I have loved you.\" M. C. S."

            "content": "The Felt Recreation Center Marie Fox Felt Streets on East First South Street in Salt Lake City, Utah, especially when days are pleasant, one may see little children playing on the sidewalk or perhaps sitting on the steps of the entrance to a cheap hotel which is their home. There are other such places in downtown Salt Lake and many other such children, but to the hurrying crowds on the busy streets, that means little or nothing. But there is a story here, a challenging story, and these children need our interest, our attention and our love. For a moment let us go behind the front door of this hotel and meet some of the children and their parents. Such a chance came to the writer one day in the following way: The large door of the J. H. Felt Motor Supply Company at 60 Regent Street in Salt Lake City was pushed open wide. The truck rolled out on its way to serve the garage men and service station operators with auto supplies and accessories. The door remained open. It was the spring of 1938. As I stood at the door, enjoying the first breath of spring air, two little boys walked up this narrow street. As they neared the door, David spoke. \"Hello.\" \"Hello\" I said, returning the greeting. \"And where do you boys live?\" They told me, and as the conversation continued I learned from these boys that they belonged to a gang Page 262 B seexts on State and Main to which only children up to ten might belong. And they had a hut. There men tacked wall paper up to make rooms, they hid their money in tin cans, and the girls cooked their dinner. \"Just where is this hut?\" I asked. \"Oh, we can't tell. Only kids in our gang can know,\" they said. The next day they were back again. \"T'm just as sorry as I can be that I am not ten years old,\" I said. \"Why?\" they asked. \"Because if I were, perhaps you would let me belong to your gang.\" \"Oh, you can,\" said David. \"Each year we make it higher. Next year kids up to twelve can belong.\" \"How many years before I may belong?\" I asked. \"Oh, we will let you belong right now,\" they said. Next day they agreed to let my husband and also our stockman join, and the gang headquarters were immediately transferred to the loading platform of the J. H. Felt Motor Supply Company. Each day, all summer long, whenever the trucks were not loading, the children played. In ages they ranged from two to twelve, in numbers from ten to fifteen at a time. Pencils, crayons, the backs of discarded letter papers, newspapers, crepe paper, sewing sets, games and packing boxes, together with healthy, active imaginations were combined to make pleasant and happy hours for these children. THE FELT RECREATION CENTER 263 ORIGINAL GROUP OF CHILDREN WHO PLAYED AT J. H. FELT MOTOR SUPPLY COMPANY, 1938 Mrs. Marie Fox Felt standing at back Puppet shows, vaudeville shows, reproductions of movies, including their version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" were presented. Under guidance they were safe and the ugly side of life, too often the lot of such children to know, was partially replaced by happier things. AS time went on, many people became interested in this little group. Each day for many months Miss Merle Corey brought two gallons of milk to our store for these children. It was dispensed to them in quart bottles, divided according to the number in a family. Milk, vegetables, and apples were also supplied to this group by Mr. Joseph Kirkwood and Miss Mary Kirkwood of American Fork, and brought to Salt Lake by Miss Corey. Games, clothing, etc., were furnished from time to time by Mr. And Mrs. C. Lamont Felt, Miss Rose Jones, Mrs. George H. Wallace and others. When traveling salesmen would call to sell merchandise to my husband, Joseph H. Felt, they also would make contributions to the happiness of this little group. Chief among these were Mr. Paul J. Buss of the Burrell Belting Company of Chicago. Upon one visit to Salt Lake he and his good wife bought quite a number of games and presented them to us for the children. One Saturday afternoon early in the summer the group was taken to Hogle Zoo for an outing. None of these children had ever been to the Zoo before. Each child was 264 supplied with a bag of popcorn to feed the animals. Such a wonderful afternoon it was! After a ride to Fort Douglas and the State Capitol, the outing was concluded by a trip to an ice cream parlor as guests of Mr. C. Lamont Felt. Throughout the hot summer days these children played in the space where the trucks were parked when not in use. The numbers grew constantly. Each new little child who moved into this hotel was immediately brought to meet me and be introduced to the playthings available. A workbench provided the table upon which to draw, and wooden packing boxes were the chairs upon which the children sat. In order to avoid controversy each child had a box of his own upon which his name was printed. That was his chair whenever he wished to claim it. We all enjoyed that summer. I thought that when school started our summer play school would end, but not so. The children came to see me on their way to school; they called in at noon as they went home for lunch; and again as they went back to school after lunch. From about 3:45 until 5:30 our store was filled with children: drawing, putting on shows and programs, playing with plasticine and printing presses, etc. We had more children than at any previous time. \"ONE day someone announced that \"' Bob had moved into the hotel and that he was so mean that everybody hated him. He was sort of a bully, teasing at every turn. \"If you let him come over here to play, we can't come any more,\" the children confided to me., 1943 \"Why not invite Bob to come to our club?\" I asked. \"If we keep him busy doing good things and having a good time, he won't have time to be mean to you and tease you.\" The children just gasped. They knew if they did they wouldn't be able to come themselves. I then said, \"Well, talk it over with your parents. Ask them if they don't think it best to have Bob come: here where we can keep him busy doing good things rather than to keep him outside ready to de mean things to you when you come out.\" Days passed by. One evening just' as I was about to go home from work, Don and Johnny came dashing in, calling, \"Mrs. Felt, Mrs. Felt, guess what?\" Of course I wondered what on earth had happened. They said that they had been talking to Bob about clubs and gangs and had told Bob that they belonged to one. \"Which one do you belong to\" Bob had asked. \"To Mrs. Felt's gang,\" replied Don. \"Why don't you let me belong?\" \"Because\" answered Don, \"If you belong to Mrs. Felt's gang you will have to be good.\" Well, Bob promised to be good, and the next day he came to play with the other children. He was just as pleasant and grand as a little boy could be, and proved to be quite a leader. One day I asked him if he liked to belong to our club and he >>? Replied, \"Darn tootin'. Y this time the group of children had grown to such numbers that I decided I must either assume a fulltime THE FELT RECREATION CENTER 265 CHILDREN AT SAND TABLE Felt Recreation Center, 1940 job with them and resign as the bookkeeper of the J. H. Felt Motor Supply Company, or make arrangements with some one to care for them. Their homes or hotel rooms were so small, so poorly furnished, and so unattractive, that I felt I could not send them back there. There must be a way out, I decided. One day representatives of the W. P. A. Nursery School and Parent Education movement called at the store to see me. I spoke to them about this opportunity for the W. P. A. To perform a marvelous bit of service. Right in the heart of town, according to statistics, was the hot spot for juvenile crime and delinquency.. Too much leisure time in a poor environment with poor surroundings encouraged children to engage in the first acts which lead to trouble. My callers were greatly impressed with the urgent need for action. They talked with the leaders in charge of the W. P. A. Recreation program. One of their number was sent to investigate the matter. After a thorough investigation he considered the project one of great merit. He conferred with Miss Jessie Schofield, at that time superintendent of Salt Lake City's recreation program, with whom the W. P. A. Co-operated on all projects within the confines of Salt Lake City. She likewise made an investigation and voiced her hearty approval. The next problem was to find a place in which to meet. Funds were low and no one seemed to be able to obtain sufficient money with 266 which to rent a building. After some time, permission was granted by Mayor John M. Wallace and Wallace F. Bennett, representing their corporation, to use the rear of the building upstairs at 68 Regent Street, rent free, if the city would pay for the light and heat. In addition to this, these men provided $100.00 for the buying of necessities to fix up the building. With this money and some provided by the Salt Lake City Recreation Department, W. P. A. Labor cleaned, catcimined, and painted the interior of the building. ON March 9, 1939 the Center was opened and officially christened the Felt Recreation Center.. A few days previous to this time, when the invitations were being sent out to the parents and children, Bob asked if he might take one to Judge Rulon Clark of the Juvenile Court, Mr. Clegg, and others. (Bob was a ward ot the Juvenile Court.) As a result of these invitations the Judge and four of the men who worked in that department came. On the opening night at 7:30 crowds filled the hall. Miss Jessie Schofield was master of ceremonies. A very interesting and varied program was presented. Here were about 200 who attended on that opening night. Representatives from the City, the Kiwanis Club, the W. P. A., the Women's Clubs, Church groups and Mr. Wallace Bennett as landlord of the building, were present. Refreshments were served through the courtesy of the Kiwanis Club. During the next year the crowds increased. The age of the children attending went gradually upward. The activities became many and varied to interest those of all ages. There was also a play school for the little children under school age. After school, activities were provided for children from six to eighteen. A handcraft department was added for the benefit and interest of the mothers. ONE year later, March 1940, it became necessary for the Center to move a second time. There were far too many children attending regularly to accommodate them adequately. Through the courtesy of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints we moved into the building at 60 South 2nd East. This was provided to use rent free, with the City paying the light, heat, and janitorial service. Gymnasium facilities were provided in addition to all of the activities that had been a regular part of the program previously. A dance was held for the teen-age boys and gitls each Friday evening. Often as many as two hundred and fifty young people between the ages of fourteen and eighteen attended. There was no admission charge. Good behavior was the only requirement. While at this location our enrollment reached the seven hundredth mark. In May 1941, it was necessary for us to move again. The Government needed more room for regional offices and wanted our quarters in addition to those they were occupying next door to us. We all felt that we must now find permanent quarters. The project had grown to the point where we felt that it was worthy of consideration by the City. THE FELT RECREATION CENTER Consequently the efforts of the City Recreation Department, the Kiwanis Club, and the Felt Advisory Council were pooled to accomplish this. After much work on the part of this group, the City Commission voted to purchase the old Masonic Temple located on the corner of First South and Second East in Salt Lake City. With it came property 165 feet by 165 feet, thus providing space for an outdoor playground, a luxury which had not been ours up to this time. We were just beginning to get settled in this new home of ours when World War II broke out. Our boys in the service had to be taken care of, and quarters for the U. S. O. Became a vital necessity. Because our building was so large and so wellfitted for the program needed for our soldier boys, we were asked once more to step aside and to find other quarters for the duration of the war. This we did after being assured by the City Commission that this building and property would be returned to the City Recreation Department for the use and benefit of these downtown children after the war was over. An order to this effect appears on the City's books in the Recorder's Office. T present, the Felt Recreation Center is located at 151 South State Street in Salt Lake City. This place has been leased for the Center by the City Commission for its use during the war, until such a time as it may return to the building originally purchased for it. Due to the size of the building, the program is a curtailed one. Only children of 267 school age can be accommodated. In these war times we are glad to have such a beautiful and comfortable place, even though it is too small for our needs. Another thing for which we are very glad is the quality of leadership provided here for the boys and girls by the Salt Lake City Corporation. Under their leadership, the boys and girls enrolled at the Center have set up self-governing organizations. They have their own officers and councils. 'They set up their own standards of behavior and plan their own activities. Each month they pay dues of 5c each. For those who may not have the money, provision is made whereby they may perform a service in lieu of it. Limited gymnasium facilities are provided, also table tennis, quiet games, handcraft, woodwork, books and magazines for reading, art instruction, sewing, vocal and instrumental music opportunities, dancing, golf instruction, archery, clay modeling, and assistance with the hobbies of those who attend. All in all it is a busy and an interesting place. Those who come are made most welcome. As to whether or not the Center has accomplished the good for which it was organized, we can only say that according to Judge Rulon Clark of the Juvenile Court, this Center has done more to assist his department in the overcoming and prevention of crime than any other single endeavor that has come to his notice. Our goal is far from reached, but we be. Lieve that with the generous interest and support of all those who are working for the welfare of youth, there will come a time when juvenile delinquency will be a rarity."

They can, if they have been taught to do a few things for themselves; and if they haven't, it is time mother took a vacation to find out where she has made. Her mistakes. Children will soon learn to do many Page 268 things for themselves when mother is not there to do the work. Mothers occasionally need new vistas... A new outlook on life. Without it they become like an old shoe, all run-down at the heel and a little sloppy. It is surprising how bright and new the comfortable old shoe can be made with just a little rest, and with new paths to tread for a few days. A week after f had left home a letter came from ten-year-old Jean. \"I hope you will be home soon, Mother Dear. There are so many problems and I need your advice about them,\" read the letter in her careful handwriting. I longed to rush out and take the first plane home, but I realized that this little daughter of mine had learned a lesson many children never learn. If I stayed a little longer, perhaps it would prove to be a lesson she would never forget. That one expression of trust from one of my children made the trip more than worth while. The old saying about not missing the water till the well is dry, fits the case perfectly. Since our job as mothers is such a constant one, it sometimes becomes monotonous and trying. We are there so constantly that both the mother and the family fail to appreciate each other until they are separated for a short time. MOTHER TAKES A HOLIDAY PERHAPS the greatest good that we mothers can gain from a holiday is the discovery that without all these tasks, our lives are quite empty. Our need for a vacation does not mean that we are tired of our job, but that the monotony of it has dulled the romance of wifehood and motherhood. All we need is a restful change. We have stayed so close to the lovely picture that we have failed to see all its beauty. We need occasionally to move a short distance away to appreciate its full significance. While walking one day, I passed a prim white cottage that reminded me of my own home. I paused as I heard the sweet, deep voice of a happy woman singing as she worked. The melody and the words made me stop short... \"Goin' home, Goin' home, I'm a-goin' home.\" I wanted to go home. I had seen the ocean, twinkling night-skylines, beauty and splendor, enough to last me for quite a while. My hands had become soft and white, such hands as the advertisements suggest are necessary for enduring romance. I was rested through and through. My mind and body ached for physical work. I longed to slip my hand down in a sock with a not-too-large hole that needed darning. I wanted to wash and iron, and scrub a kitchen floor while I sang. I realized that for nine whole days I had not raised my voice to sing. I had had my holiday and it had been fun while it lasted. It was over now, and I wanted to go home. The family. Did not expect me home for several days. I realized 269 that perhaps I was foolish to drop in on them without warning. There would be things they would want to do to make my homecoming all that they had planned. But I wanted to go home and surprise them. It was I who was surprised! HE whole family was busily preparing dinner. Inside and out the house was as clean and tidy as the proverbial pin. There was no need to warn them of my coming. I knew without being told that they had taken pride in keeping home like this all the time I had been gone. There were braids where I had left curls, but braids are neater anyway. These children of mine were selfreliant. All they needed was a chance to demonstrate it. After joyous greetings were over, one of the first things said was, \"Oh, Mother, we had no idea how much fun Daddy is. He knows more funny stories, and he did so many interesting things with us.\" My holiday had given these children a new father, one they scarcely knew before. He hadn't liked the idea of the vacation alone, but it had proved to be a great experience in his life also. It had given him a real opportunity to get acquainted with his children. That night as I lay in my own comfortable bed, I fully realized for the first time what John Howard Payne meant when he wrote, \"There's no place like home.\" I knew then that every mother needs to get away by herself once in a while to fully appreciate the significance of those immortal lines."

            "content": "Unemployed Clothing Called Into Service Leda T. Jensen Member of Relief Society General Board REMODELING means to again or to rearrange. To the woman trained to \"waste not want not,\" who is skillful with her fingers and the tools of sewing, the word remodeling is a fascinating one, setting up in her mind all sorts of ideas for the creating of useful and lovely articles of wearing apparel from used material which would otherwise be often wasted. To all too many women the word has little or no meaning, and only calls to mind an undesirable problem in which she has and wants no part. The whole world is at war. No one can say when peace will be established again, nor what the conditions will be when the clouds of war have cleared away. We are, however, becoming increasingly mindful of the fact that the problems of the present conflict are touching our lives more and more, disrupting our living routine, and our method of doing things. We hear on all sides the words conservation, salvaging, saving. 'The home is called the second front, and women in the home are urged to accept the challenge to do their part in various ways to help win the war. Because commodities of all kinds are flowing into army camps and Page 20 being sent to battlefronts and the United Nations in all part of he world, consumers are finding their purchasing of goods of all kinds greatly limited. Clothing the family is a problem vital to the war effort. Textiles are weapons of war. The requirements of our armed forces for textiles and clothing affects every family in the United States. Even before Pearl Harbor, national production managers and economists of our country foresaw what might happen to the things we buy, and the Government began a National War on Waste. The highlight of Civilian Defense Week November 11th to 16th, 1941, was the signing of the Consumer's Pledge by millions of Americans. Mrs. Roosevelt and the White House housekeeper signed the first pledge which read: As a consumer in the total defense of democracy, I will do my part to make my home, my community, my country, ready, efficient, and strong. I will buy carefully. I will take good care of the things I have. I will waste nothing. The Consumer's Pledge as it relates to clothing means to waste nothing, to take care of every bit of fabric in the home, and to buy carefully. UNEMPLOYED CLOTHING CALLED INTO SERVICE OMEN all over the country have accepted this challenge as a patriotic duty. There is more money in circulation today, but the patriotic citizen spends his money first for taxes, debts, and bonds, and almost last for extra clothing in order to release more textiles and clothing: for direct war needs. \"To release materials, machines, men, and money for war operations, civilians must cut their clothing requirements to the core, basing them on needs, not wants. It is important to civilian morale that this situation be met intelligently and cheerfully.\" If we do not meet the problem voluntarily, rationing will force us to do so. \"This year of 1943 should be a year of conservationstain removal, moth control, mending, alteration of patterns, fitting, remodeling old clothes, and making new ones.\" War, with its extra calls for sewing and mending, always gives impetus to needlework. Sewing for the Red Cross to help care for the wounded on the battlefield and in the hospitals, as well as to clothe refugees in Europe and China, started a revival of home sewing throughout the country even before the United States declared war on the Axis. Since Pearl Harbor the need has come closer home, and women are meeting the challenge to conserve for the war effort. The sale of yardage goods throughout the nation has increased from 40 to 50 per cent over the sales during the same period in former years, and the sale of patterns has almost kept pace. There is a growing desire on the part of many women to acquire the ability to wield a needle. Higher 271 living costs are making many women who have been accustomed to buy their clothing ready-made, turn to home sewing as a means of getting the quality they want for the price they can pay. The rationing of tires and gasoline, the extreme difficulty in procuring maid service for the home, and the ever-growing list of rationed foods and household articles will result in many women, particularly women with dependent young children, remaining in their homes more than they did before the war. Art and needlework instructors in department stores report that more women are interested in handwork at the present time than for many years. 'This is probably due to one or both of two reasons: (1) the desire to assist the war effort by knitting and sewing for the Red Cross; and (2) the desire to find an outlet for emotional and mental strain. Since women are turning to the satisfactions derived from working with their hands, it is well for those women with children or small friends and relatives, to turn part of their desire for handwork into utilizing outmoded wearing apparel for their clothing needs. T is sometimes difficult to find time for sewing, mending, and renovating, but time should be taken for all of these. Attics and storage places should be searched for all '\"'unemployed\" garments that may be put into service. It is wise to bring outmoded garments into use to conserve clothing, to save money, and to utilize. Materials which are better than those to be purchased now. 272 The present regulations for price control are not tied to specific standards of quality. A ceiling price as of a certain date carries with it no sure  guarantee that the quality is the same as that of a former date. Reduction of serviceability without a consequent reduction in price is contrary to the spirit of the regulation, but enforcement of such a principle in the complex field of clothing is exceedingly difficult. Numerous complaints are coming from consumers to the effect that though they pay higher prices for wearing apparel, they have no assurance as to its wearing qualities, laundering, or cleaning possibilities. Because of this, it may be wise for a consumer to use material she has on hand that has proved to be good and wait for something more to be done in the way of labeling to reveal the fiber content, method, and kind of dye used, cleaning possibilities, etc., of any new materials she buys. \"Ready-made articles of clothing will rise more in price than yard goods. Increasing clothing costs can be met by home sewing, particularly in the field of remodeling.\" When one sets out to remodel an article, the material or fabric is already at hand. Often the only outlay of money will be for a spool of thread and a pattern. Some findings for remodeled garments need cost no money. It takes only a little while to make a collection of buckles, buttons, zippers, snap fasteners, and hooks and eyes from worn-out garments. If these are sorted and kept in separate cans or boxes, they will be readily accessible when needed for use on remodeled garments or even on new ones. Most remodeling has to do with the making of children's clothing from adults. The reason for this is obvious. Often it isn't possible to change the style of a garment for an adult by"

            "content": "making over a used one, unless the older material is combined with new material in some way. Worn spots are difficult to manage, and it isn't wise to spend time on something that won't look smart when it is finished; so the majority of remodeling problems has to do with making smaller garments out of larger ones so as to avoid using worn edges, the thin places on the elbows of sleeves, the seats of trousers, etc. The possibilities of this process are many and varied: children's coats. From adults' coats; boys' trousers from men's; snowsuits and sport coats from overcoats; young girls' and misses' suits from older brother's and fathers' suits; small girls' slips, bloomers, aprons, and pinafores from the backs, upper sleeves, and tails of men's shirts; and little boys' shirts from fathers'. Men's shirts are made of much better material than boys' ready-made shirts or the yardage that can be purchased for them, and often the buttonholes and buttons on a shirt can be utilized as they are. At no time in the life of a girl is it as important for her to be well-dressed as during adolescence. Good looking accessories for the adolescent girl such as belts, collars, suit fronts, vests, and jerkins may be made from material already on hand, and will do much to satisfy her desire for frequent changes in her apparel. Most small children have no aversion to remodeled clothing. Often a mother's ability to use outmoded or UNEMPLOYED CLOTHING CALLED INTO SERVICE partially worn garments means the difference between her child looking neat and well-clothed, or poor and shabby. It is when a seam has been taken in, the sleeves or skirt shortened, or some other alteration made to make a too large garment fit a smaller child without regard for line or correct proportions, that a garment looks made-over and dowdy. If one plans to make over old garments, in order to obtain the best results, the garments should first be entirely picked apart, and thoroughly cleaned by washing or dry cleaning. Then one should cut and sew as if new material were being used and the results will then be satisfactory. Often one finds that more problems present themselves when cutting small articles from pieces of fabric than when cutting them from a continuous length, especially when a commercial pattern with an illustrated layout is used. A few devices will help to overcome such difficulties. Frequently a yoke across the back. Or front of the waist, a patch pocket to cover a worn spot or the place where a slit pocket has been, cuffs where no cuffs are designed in the pattern, a seam not called for at the waist which can be hidden by a belt, or a pleat to hide a piecing in a skirt will help. MANY mothers will agree that these suggestions sound fine but will confess that they don't know how to sew. To many women today needlework or sewing of any kind is a lost art, something that passed into oblivion with he coming of the industrial age and mass production; but an extension clothing specialist in Indiana wrote in an article in the 273 Journal of Home Economics, \"Indiana homemakers, who had almost forgotten the pleasure and satisfaction of sewing for the family, have brought out their sewing machines, and dusted and oiled them ready for work. 'Those who have never sewed before are enthusiastic over their first attempts. \"A swing back to home sewing is, to be sure, a wartime necessity, but it is a perennial satisfaction to those who have really mastered the art.\" If a person is interested in any program, she can learn, with conscientious effort, to take part in the program, and reversely, if a person wishes to build up interest in any problem she must enter into the solving of the problem. One is never too old to gain new knowledge nor acquire new skills. MANY methods may be worked out to enable one to learn to sew, if this important ability hasn't been developed. Of course the easiest method is to enroll in high school, college, or special sewing school classes, or in a civic organization that has set up a sewing class. If it is not possible to do this, a group of women might obtain the services, over a given period of time, of a high school or college teacher. If enough mothers became interested, the Relief Society would be happy to provide instruction as part of its work-and-business day program. An individual plan might. Be worked out to help a neighbor or friend with problems in her home for the help she might give in problems of sewing. Sewing clubs could be organized to meet in one another's homes, or in some public room. Almost - 274 anyone who is adept at sewing will be willing to help others if the time and place can be arranged. \"Where there's a will there's a way,\" and people who really wish assistance, can find some way to obtain help from those who can give it. Don't agree with the defeatist who says that women won't do anything about conservation, that there is too much money on hand, and that too many clothes are available. Rather stop and considerHave I given myself a real chance to know what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and how it can be done? \"Tt has been said many times by those who take the long view and who are seeing beyond the present cmergency, that in these United States of America we face today a new way of life. It is a way of life in which we shall have to be useful both to ourselves and to our community, if we are to gain real satisfaction.\" Who knows but that our efforts to do our part in conservation for the war effort will equip us to live more satisfactorily and efficiently no matter what conditions prevail when peace is again established? Let us see to it that whatever our part may be in the fight for democracy, we do it well. Bibliography Journal of Home Economics. Better Homes and Gardens. American Home. Deseret News."

Man-like, he'd gone to see a softball game, Though there were twenty chores that she could name That needed doing round the house and yard. The earth about the shrubs was packed too hard For woman hands to loosen, and the grass On all three lawns was just a tangled mass. No use to try to tell him, for he read The news and didn't hear a word she said, Or else he listened to the radio. How he could stand the noise, she didn't know; But if she went to tell him what she thought, She'd find him soundly sleeping, like as not, She'd turn that racket off. This time he'd. Hear. So she went rushing inbut a quick fear Caught at her hair and twisted in a chill All down her back. He sat there, slumped and still, With no more movement in him than a rock; And she stood, racked and empty with the shock, And all her angry words congealed in her. Quickly she reached out for his wrist. A stir, A rasping snore, and breathing was resumed. Blessed life! It was not what she'd assumed. And with returning rhythm, calm and deep, Her fear thinned, and she stood and watched him sleep. In every sagging muscle, pale but sure, Fatigue had stamped a lasting signature. It struck her with the suddenness of breath, Some day she might stand face to face with death. Then she could see, like stones upon him there, The separate weights of all he had to bear Not only money cares that daily drew A wall around him as the children grew, But fine intangibles she could not name Like loyalty and faith, which stayed the same Whether their lives ran. Smooth as grass or rough As shag. His side of life showed plain enough So she felt shamed and knew her grumbling mean. A man must have some letup from routine. What canon gave her right to criticize? She dabbed an apron corner at her eyes. Affection rose and smothered out her fear, And even his faults seemed rare and strangely dear."

            "content": "Home Entertainment Nellie O. Parker Member of Relief Society General Board ON FE day a kindergarten teacher took her children for a walk. When the children's enthusiasm began to wane they complained of being tired, too tired to walk any more. She was confronted with the problem of getting them back to their schoolroom, so she purchased a box of animal crackers from a nearby grocery store and gave each child an animal -to ride on. Instantly there was a rejuvenation of spirits and the children went galloping back i in high glee. The teacher wisely harnessed their play instinct and their love for makebelieve. She changed their attitude, making it fun to ride home on their imaginary steeds. The play way of teaching or leading children is an effective, easy way to get results. When the cultivation of the play spirit is neglected or ignored in home or family life, some of the most vital forces are lost that would cement the family circle and bring about a joyous, enriched living. Everyone needs recreation. President Brigham Young said, ''Recreation and diversion are as necessary to our well-being as the more serious pursuits of life.\" Youth seeks self-expression for his store of energy, and from his activities his character is built. Following natural urges in his play, the child gains ability to do thingsto express himself, to master himself, and to adjust socially. If his play is wisely directed he learns to co-operate, to be unselfish, to be honest and fair, to lose graciously as well as win. He gets training in being alert, observant, and resourceful. He gets opportunity to use his initiative, to try his wings. And best of all, he has fun while doing it. ADULTS need relaxation and change so that a recharging of powers, a regeneration of spirit may take place. A playful attitude of mind must be acquired to gain this relaxation. \"As long as a man can retain his play incentive he will retain his sense of humor, and happiness will prevail more easily im his heart.\" With war restrictions keeping people home, a new interest is being awakened in home entertainment. We are finding that much can be gained by playing together at home. Parents can learn a great deal about their children by playing with them. They should set a good pattern of unselfish leadership and allow children opportunity for leadership. Many books and magazines are giving helpful suggestions for planning fun for the family, fun without money, giving lists of games and other activities which can be adapted to any home and its different age groups. The Latter-day Saints have always emphasized the importance of the home and the potency of its influence in building capable, upright men and women. The leaders, from the Prophet Joseph Smith on, have Page 277 278 stressed the value gained from the family working and playing together. A \"home night\" has long been recommended and has become an institution in many families. A little book Recreation in the Home recently published by the auxiliary organizations of the Church (which sells for the very nominal sum of 25 cents, will be found very helpful in assisting parents to plan for the various occasions that arise: birthdays, weddings, holidays, neighborly get-to-gethers, honor days (when some member of the family has achieved success or recognition, ) etc. PARENTS should take advantage of every opportunity to celebrate these occasions. It will add a zest and a buoyancy to living that all members will enjoy and always remember. It need not add a strain on the family budget, and will repay bounteously for the trouble taken. A festive atmosphere can be added to the regular dinner by putting candles and some unique decoration on the table, by preparing the usual food in fancy ways, and by serving it in the family's prettiest dishes. The party attitude is the important thing. Let the imagination come to the fore and plan original things, allowing the children to participate in the planning and preparation. Dress up and glorify common things, tint or whiten weeds, put faces on cookies, make turtles out of large raisins using cloves for the head and feet, make funny men out of apples, potatoes, prunes, etc. (see pages 60-63, Home Recreation). Plan surprises often. Make mealtime a happy time, especially when all the family are together and have time to relax. Play games at the table. One could pretend that he is a distinguished guest or someone well-known to all. He might be President Roosevelt, Eddie Rickenbacker, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Aunt Grace, or Cousin Stan, who is an ensign in the navy. By his actions and conversation the family guesses who each one is representing. All enter into the play of entertaining the guest. Another game in which smaller children can participate is guessing the object in the room of which the leader is thinking. Questions are asked and the one who guesses correctly first, then becomes the leader. Bible characters may be used for a guessing game. One persons says, \"I am thinking of a man in the Bible whose name begins with 'J' \". The others ask questions until they find out who he is. New games may be invented and old ones adapted. 'The family who will play like this while eating will have little trouble getting Michael to eat his vegetables or Jane to drink her milk. A timid child will unconsciously enter into the game. THERE are numerous games suitable for different occasions, and for the places in which they are to be played whether it be the living room, amusement room, or out of doors. For adults and older children who read and write, there are pencil and paper games which may be played at the table after the meal is finished, or in the living room, such as Consequences: One player writes on a piece of paper a man's name and then folds the paper so as to hide what has been written; the next HOME ENTERTAINMENT writes a woman's name; the next what he did; another, what she did; then what he said; and then what she said; and finally the consequences; each phrase is written by a different player. A reading of. The entire list affords much amusement. Another game is titled Dictionary: A long word is written at the top of paper, such as \"'metropolitan,\" then each player tries to compile the longest list of words using only the letters contained in the word, \"metropolitan.\" Words containing many of the vowels are the most successful ones to use for this game. Bible and other quizzes will be interesting as well as _ instructive. (Page 73, Home Recreation) Some games not too strenuous to be played in th living room and which people of all ages can enjoy are: Stake Coach, Magic Music, How Do You Like Your Neighbor, Fruit Basket, etc. Young children love to play such games with their elders. For children's parties the old standbys: Blind Man's Buff, Drop the Handkerchief, Musical Chairs,. Poison, etc., are always enjoyed. Games suitable for the out of doors (or rumpus room) include: Last Couple Out, and Hide and Seek. Croquet is an excellent lawn game for the family. It combines skill with courtesy and fair play. A horseshoe-pitching court may utilize the space between cement strips of driveway if no other space is available. A backyard fireplace can be the center for family or children groups to gather for weiner roasts, games, and story-telling. 279 From the time the baby starts to coo, mother can begin little singing and action games such as \"This Little Pig Goes To Market,\" played with his toes, and finger games, such as \"Here's A Ball For Baby,\" and \"Thumbkin Says [ll Dance.\" She can tell the toddler the story of \"The Little Red Hen and The Kernel of Wheat\" while she is making bread; the story of \"The Gingerbread Boy\" when making cookies, or \"Little Tom Thumb\" while she is stirring up a cake or pudding. You remember Tom was sitting on the edge of the bowl while his mother was making a pudding. He fell in when his mother wasn't looking and she stirred him into the batter and put the pudding on to boil, and that was the beginning of his adventures. Children love these and similar stories and will ask for them again and again. THERE are many stories which will help parents to teach lessons in unselfishness, forgiveness, fortitude, etc. Care should be taken, though, not to spoil a story by moralizing, as children will grasp the message if it is well told. Reading, as well as storytelling is delightful entertainment for all members of the family. Each of the older ones can take a turn in being the reader. Bible stories should be included among the \"musts.\" It is well to cater to the family's interests in the type of entertainment planned, but a balanced diversified program should be offered. Dramatizing stories and events, playing charades and pantomimes and doing some dancing to the radio 280 or phonograph, if home musicians are not available, will all be enjoyed for a change. If the family is musical, much real satisfaction will be gained in singing or playing together. All families should sing even though they are not naturally endowed with fine voices. A singing family is a happy one. There is no better way to keep the home fires burning. Singing refuels the morale of the family or a nation. Handicraft of various types suited to individual inclinations should be encouraged, such as woodwork, metal work, scissor pictures, whittling, modeling, painting, weaving, needle work, etc. Each child should be lead to find the activity in which he receives greatest satisfaction. Everyone should be able to do something well, to create with his hands. There can be projects in woodwork, gardening, quilting, and rugmaking, etc., which, if carried on in the spirit of play, will not only make additions to the resources of the home, and increase the skill of family fingers, but also deepen and enrich a happy purposeful living. At least once each week the family should have a date to have fun together. Letter from a Service Man The following excerpts taken from a letter written to his parents by a member of the Church serving in the Navy is typical of the letters coming from our Latter-day Saint. Boys serving throughout the world in the armed forces of our nation: I am a Latter-day Saint. 1 have made that statement many times before in many different ways. Sometimes I have said it defiantly, expecting in return some smart crack or piece of vulgar wit; sometimes proudly, as when reading of the courage and faith of the great men of the Church; and sometimes casually, as when answering questions for statistical purposes. But never have I made that statement with the same feeling as I do today. Today I have a testimony of the powci of the Lord, a testimony of the authority of the Church and its restoration... Today, when I say I am a Latter-day Saint, it is with the feeling of pride, a feeling of defiance, and a feeling of humbleness. A feeling of thankfulness that the Lord has favored me by allowing me to be born to parents who are members of the Church. Dad, this isn't the conventional way to start a letter, but I was fired with the necessity of getting the above discourse off my chest, and you are the victim. It is rather poorly told, a masterpiece of understatement, for on the surface it is rather simple; but I am afraid there are no words to describe what I have in mind, and this is the best I can do. Wendell Call"

            "content": "Halfway is not Enough Vaunee T. Larson THIS is our street, Betty,\" Glen Williams informed his wife as he turned their car from Main onto Vine Maple. \"And our house for the next few months, or-at least as long as I'm a special agent for Uncle Sam, is the last one down.\" The car crept along that Betty might see the surroundings of their new home. \"'A little white cottage covered with roses,\" Betty said dreamily. \"What a dear little place.\" She glanced eagerly about her. \"And how friendly all the houses look on this street.\" She and Glen had been married only a few months and to move into a distant strange community was an exciting experience for her. \"I don't think I'll mind being so far from Utah after all. Now tell me who lives in each one.\" 'That I don't know, Dear.\" \"Glen Williams, you mean you've lived here two whole weeks and don't know the names of any of our neighbors?\" Betty demanded incredulously. \"Well, Honey, I spent the first day finding this place, and after that my time's been taken up with my work and writing letters to my lovely wife telling her how much I missed her,\" Glen replied easily. \"Besides, who am I that the neighborhood ladies should be trooping over to call on me?\" \"You're just about the nicest husband in the whole world and I think the neighborhood ladies made a great mistake in not visiting you firsthand and finding that out,\" Betty said impudently. \"Til wager you'll soon be acquainted with all of them,\" Glen said, \"and then you can tell me all the news.\" Before Glen turned off the motor Betty was out of the car and bounding up the walk as happy as a youngster. Inside she observed instantly that with the addition of the few vases and pictures which she had thoughtfully packed, this \"furnished\" house would be as livable and lovable a home as any they could desire. She whisked an apron from her traveling bag and began to prepare a tasty dinner for her husband, singing merrily the whole time. Maybe the neighbor ladies had slighted her husband by not offering him a fresh piece of pie, or a piece of cake, or some cookies, but she would soon remedy that she mused, as she thought of all his favorite dishes. She was a \"born\" cook just like her mother. As she prepared a fruit salad, she thought of the delicacies she had seen her mother make and distribute to the sick, or needy, or to strangers. On the few occasions when there had been sickness in her family always some of the good sisters had brought in food, or come in to do the work. These same women had been the first to welcome the strangers moving in, so that they had invariably exclaimed. \"Why this is the friendliest place we've ever lived.\" Page 281 282 BETTY was a fast worker and within a few days the little house was wearing freshly laundered curtains over its sparkling glass panes. She had scrubbed it from the basement to the tiny attic. Glen had protested all her work on it, but she had said, \"Oh, there's nothing like cleaning a house to really make it one's own. Besides, when the neighborhood ladies come to call I want to have everything spick and span. Seems as if they should be coming to see me soon,\" she added thoughtfully. \"T wouldn't worry about it, Betty. Don't you imagine they've seen you cleaning and wished to wait until you were all through?\" \"Yes, of course, that's why,\" Betty said. However, the days lengthened into a weck and the weeks into almost a month and still no callers came. Betty's spirit drooped and she lost some of her zest for her new home. Not in the evenings. With Glen at home they were perfect. They worked in their Victory Garden, or they sat and talked or read, or listened to an especially nice musical program on the radio. It was the daytime hours that were so interminably long with Glen gone from eight in the morning until six at night. Sometimes in the daytime she was so overcome with loneliness and homesickness it was difficult to restrain her tears. She doubted if Glen would understand her feeling as he had been a missionary in a foreign land and had early developed a selfsustaining spirit which she had always admired, so she said nothing to him. After she gave way to such feelings of loneliness, she mentally lashed herself for seeming to lack a pioneer spirit. Goodness, what if she really had hardships to bear such as countless women in this war were facing with fortitude. After such thoughts she would dry her tears and go outside and putter with the flowers. Whenever she saw Mrs. Beemer, her elderly neighbor, in her yard or garden she went to the fence and tried to engage her in conversation. Mrs. Beemer answered pleasantly enough but if Betty only smiled and said nothing, Mrs. Beemer nodded and retired to her own house. Then there was Mrs. Boyden in  the next house down the street. Betty often saw her pass by but she only called a brisk greeting or waved her hand. In the house across the street lived the young Kelleys and their first baby. Laverne Kelley had seemed friendly enough the few times they had talked across the street. She had told Betty she was so busy with Baby Bobby she didn't know when she'd have time to call, but for Betty to come to see her. ONE bright afternoon that seemed just right for a friendly chat, Betty donned a fresh linen dress and crossed the street to Laverne's. As she went up the walk she saw Laverne peep out of the window; then, unmistakably, she heard her pattering hurriedly to and fro, probably whisking her room in order. Betty paused and admired the flowers blooming along the walk in order that Laverne wouldn't be too flustered when she arrived. Just as Betty lightly knocked on the door, Bobby started to cry. Betty had timed her visit at the hour when HALFWAY IS NOT ENOUGH she thought he was normally napping. Laverne did not answer her knock, and Betty was debating whether to open the door and boldly call, or go home, when Laverne appeared with the screaming baby in her arms. \"Oh, dear, I think he must be cutting a tooth. He seldom ever cries like this. Come in, won't you? You'll have to excuse the way my house looks. I've been so busy with washing and ironing for Bobby. A baby is an awful lot of work sometimes.\" Betty felt sorry for her. She looked so hot and tired. \"Here, let me take the baby,\" she offered. \"I'd love to hold him.\" \"No, he might muss you up. Besides he's crying so.\" Betty's visit wasn't much of a success. In a short while she left with the feeling that it was a relief to. Laverne to be alone with her baby. When she got home she. Could no longer keep back her bitter tears. Well, there was only one thing left to do and that was to get a job. She could type or clerk in a store. Anything to alleviate her utter loneliness would be welcomed. HAT night at dinner while eating fluffy biscuits and new peas, she told Glen of her intention. \"But, Honey, you know Dr. Knowlton said distinctly you were to get lots of rest, and fresh air, and sunshine for at least a year, in order for you to be a mother to some healthy youngsters of ours.\" \"Yes, I realize that Glen, and I know I'm being just awfully selfish but I guess I'm just homesick and longing to have some feminine companionship. I've tried so hard to get 283 to know our neighbors and I just can't.\" Glen tried to comfort her in his clumsy masculine way. He loved her so dearly it was a grief to him to know she was unhappy. \"Maybe we could arrange a trip home for you, Betty. How would you like that?\" \"Well, of course I would like it, Dear, but absolutely not without you. We don't know how much longer we can be together anyway, and I'm staying with you. Besides everything's perfect when you're here.\" She managed a shaky smile. \"There, I was a big baby and let's forget all about it.\" She got up quickly and made a great to-do clearing the table and washing the dishes. But Glen didn't forget about it. He pretended to read the evening paper while he was pondering the situation. \"T have it, Honey,\" he declared suddenly. Betty looked up from the socks she was darning. \"Why not have a little party?\" \"A patty?\" Betty looked at him blankly. \"Pray tell me whom would J invite, Mr. Williams?\" \"Why Mrs. Beemer, and Mrs. Boyden, and Mrs. Kelley, and Bobby.\" \"Glen, you're teasing me. Why I've already gone halfway with those people.\" \"T'm serious, Betty, honest,\" and as she still looked doubtful he continued, \"Where do you think our ~ Church would be now if our missionaries just went halfway? Plenty of times the missionaries have had to go all the way alone and it's been a tough fight, too. They've met rebuffs and abuse, but by persistence 284 they've been amply rewarded with investigators and even converts.\" \"Yes, Glen, but what has that to do with me? I'm not a missionary. I'm just a housewife who would like to get acquainted with her neighbors.\" \"Betty, I believe we're all missionaries. And any friend you can win for yourself can eventually be a friend of our Church.\" Betty was thoughtful for a moment. \"How true that sounds, Glen.\" With determination she added, \"I will invite them.\" She finished her mending, then she busied herself with her notepaper. \"I'll make it Thursday afternoon at 2:30. I've noticed Mrs. Boyden is always home on that day.\" She wrote informal notes inviting them to bring their sewing. Glen walked to the post office with her. They strolled arm-in-arm and Betty thought she had never seen the stars look brighter, \"If things don't work out for the best, maybe you can take on a job of some kind.\" Glen said, then added quickly, \"That's just to show you how certain I am your party will be a success.\" Betty looked forward eagerly to the afternoon of the party. There was fruit punch in the refrigerator and dainty cookies on her silver plate. At twenty to three no one had come. She heard steps on the porch and quickly went to the door, but it was only the postman' with a new magazine. She took it and sat in the easy chair to wait, when the doorbell rang and there was Mrs. Beemer. Laverne and Mrs. Boyden were coming up the walk together. Trt night when Glen arrived home, Betty met him at the door and lifted her face for his kiss. \"Well, how was the party?\" he. Asked confidently, seeing her shining face. \"Darling, it worked out just as you said.\" Betty kept up her chatter as Glen hung up his coat and hat, and stretched out on the divan for a few minutes' relaxation. \"You know why Mrs. Beemer hasn't ever visited over the fence with me? Well, she said once there'd been an awtully 'refined' teacher who lived here, they only hired her for a year, but she made some remark about Mrs. Beemer's atrocious English and Mrs. Beemer said she was afraid I'd think her terrible if she got 'was' and 'were' mixed up, and words like that. When I told her how my grand- * father only got through the third grade because he had to help out at home, and that it wasn't a person's English that counted with me, she timidly asked me if 'd mind helping her study a grammar book she has.\" \"Why, that's wonderful, Betty,\" Glen interrupted his wife. \"But you've only heard part of it. Mrs. Boyden wanted to know who knitted the dress I'm wearing, and when I said I did she just about hugged me, and asked me to help her with some sweaters she's knitting for the Red Cross. She's in charge of it, and it's hard to find expert knitters who have the time. 'Then she's going to take me with her once a week to make bandages and dressings down at the Center. Why, Glen she's just doing so mucli war work it makes me ashamed of myself. They have two sons overseas, too.\" Betty continued enthusiastically. HALFWAY IS NOT ENOUGH \"And Laverne had such a big basket of mending with her. She said she hadn't intended to bring it all but didn't have time to sort out her thread and so on. Well, we all pitched in and did it for her, and she was so grateful she almost cried. She said she just couldn't get all her work done and Bobby taken care of too. I asked her if she would let me care for him at least an hour every nice day and wheel him to the park, I'm going to do it tomorrow morning. She was so pleased -with the suggestion, and thinks she can missionary husband.\" 285 accomplish a great part of her work then.\" As an afterthought Betty added, \"They liked my cookies, too, and wanted the recipe.\" \"Which all goes to prove, Mrs. Williams?\" Glen suggested with a smile.... \"That from now on I'll always rely on the wisdom and judgment of my \"So how about some...?\" \"Dinner.\" Betty laughingly finished the sentence as she tripped off to the kitchen with a light step. AFTER SPRINGTIME RAIN Beatrice E. Linford Bright jewels clinging trembling to the eaves Shimmering on the edge of emerald leaves, Aglow in purple mist of lilac spray, And pinkish cloud of blooming almonds gay. All colors of the garden are renewed, Washed bright and clean, refreshed, with life imbued. Soft drip drop of the jewels upon the ground Scarce audible because of sweet, sweet sound Of robins singing gladly after rain, The bluebird's happy musical refrain. How lovely is the shining springtime rain Causing the earth to glow with life again."

            "content": "An Adequate Daily Diet and Wartime Menus Edna K. Ward The importance of food and its proper preparation is brought to the attention of every homemaker by the exigencies of total war which have been forced upon us. We want to \"make America strong,\" but a nation is made strong only as its people are strong and healthy. Each mother and homemaker is largely responsible for the health of her family; she must plan healthful meals, she must buy the food which is to constitute those meals, and now when help is scarce, she has the added responsibility of preparing that food to save important food values. To plan and prepare \"wartime menus\" is a challenge to every homemaker. It is her contribution to the war effort, and it is an important contribution. Well-planned, wellcooked meals, served in pleasant surroundings, with thankfulness in our hearts, will build strong families and a strong nation. Nutritionists have set up daily food needs, and an adequate daily diet should include the food listed in the opposite chart. In planning meals, particular attention should be given to what are termed protective foods, protective because they contain elements known to be essential to good health. These are: 1fruits 2vegetables Page 286 3 eggs 4meat swhole grains 6milk and milk products To include these important foods into the three meals each and every day\"is the homemaker's responsibility, and now with wartime restrictions and increasing shortages, the difficulties are increased. 'The following menus and recipes are suggested in the hope that they may be helpful in meeting this problem. BREAKFAST This is an important meal because it can include several of the protective foods. A suggestive pattern may be: Orange Juice Oatmeal with Milk Soft Cooked Egg Toast Jam Milk The varieties and amounts will vary with the ages and activities of each member of the family. Breakfast fruits may be: Oranges Grapefruit Strawberries (in season ) Prunes (raw or cooked) Apples (raw, baked, or sauce) Fruit juices: Orange Grapefruit Lemon Tomato GR MORE GLASSES DAILY..

Dessert, milk, bread and butter. For protein requirements a choice of: Split Pea or Bean Soup Vegetable Beef Soup Ham and Macaroni Salad Cheese Sauce on Vegetables or 'Toast Cheese and Meat Sandwiches Fish, Chicken, or Meat Salads Suggestive salads: Mixed fresh or canned Fruit. Prunes stuffed with Cheese, Carrots, Nuts Grapefruit, Orange Sections Date, Apple, Lettuce Apple, Celery, Nut Pear, Cheese Mixed Vegetables Cranberry, Celery, Nut Cabbage Grated Carrot, Raisin Molded raw Vegetables Tomato, sliced Tomatoes, stuffed Radish, Onion, hard-cooked Eggs Asparagus Desserts for lunch if required: Office workers should eat only light lunches. Fruitsfresh, dried, or canned Fruit Cobblers Fruit Pies Puddings Baked Custards Bread Puddings Fruit Whips, dried or fresh Fruit Gelatines, plain, fruited, or whipped Ice Cream Steamed Fruit Puddings Rice Pudding Cookies Oatmeal Date Bars Peanut Butter Molasses Raisin Lunch Boxes Lunch boxes, whether for an adult or a child, need to contain about one-third of his daily rations. If the midday meal is his main one, then the lunch box should contain more than a third of the food needed for the whole day. If the evening meal is the most ample and breakfast has contributed its share, then the contents of the lunch box may supply less than a third of the food needed. Laon box meals should include: Sandwiches (containing meat, fish, egg, cheese, or vegetable) or a Salad (containing meat, fish, eggs, cheese, with bread and butter) Fruit (may be Tomato) Cake or Cookies Hot Soup, Beverage, or Milk Suggestive sandwich fillings: Several fillings can be made and stored in covered containers in the refrigerator. 'This gives variety for a week's supply and helps in facilitating sandwich preparation. Meat Salad Filling 4 pound bologna or minced ham (put through fine knife of food choper 3 Pera-cooked eggs (chopped) \\% cup finely cut sweet pickle 4 tablespoons salad dressing or mayonnalse 4 tablespoons fresh or canned milk \\ tablespoon salt Mix thoroughly and chill. Fish Salad Filling cups cooked or canned fish cup finely cut sweet pickle or olives cup finely cut celery (use green tops also) tablespoon salt Y cup salad dressing or mayonnaise 4 tablespoons milk OX wv NG AN ADEQUATE DAILY DIET Peanut-Prune Filling 6 prunes cut in small pieces 1 cup seedless raisins \\4 cup peanut butter 4 tablespoons milk - 1 tablespoon lemon juice Mix well. Figg Salad Filling 6 hard cooked eggs (chopped) 6 tablespoons chopped sweet pickles or olives 5 tablespoons salad dressing Y tablespoon salt c 34 tablespoon dry mustard Mix thoroughly. Cheese Filling 2 cups grated American cheese 4 tablespoons chopped pickles or relish 1 tablespoon mustard (dry or prepared) 4 tablespoons salad dressing 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion Raw carrot strips, celery sticks cut in small pieces, and raw tender turnip slices cleaned carefully and wrapped in wax paper add extra fresh vegetables to the lunch box. Often include peanuts or any other kind of nut.. Cream soups and milk can be included in the modern lunch box that has a thermos bottle. These increase the use of those protective foods so essential to good nutrition. DINNER Whether dinner is eaten at noon or in the evening, it should furnish the main protein dish of the day, usually meat. With it are served _ vegetables and salads to give the needed additional vitamins and minerals, dessert and a beverage. 289 A pattern for dinner is usually something like this: Broiled Ground Beef Patties Baked Potatoes Buttered Carrots Mixed Vegetable Salad Muffins Butter Fruit Pudding Milk (for children) With the rationing of meat, we shall have to use meat substitutes more. If possible, plan to serve fish once a week, liver or kidney or some glandular meat once a week, and one of the legumes, such as dried beans or peas, once a week. Old-fashioned baked beans and soups, lima beans plain or with a ham hock, or a hearty dish of chili will help conserve meat. Although beans are an \"incomplete protein\" they are a good meat substitute and contain valuable vitamins. Cook beans once a week. Fish loaves served with parsley, white sauce, or lemon slices, creamed fish served on crispy hot toast or with hot baked potatoes, or fresh fish when it is available, can be served once a week also. Make it a rule to serve liver or some other type of glandular meat once a week. Beef, lamb, or pork liver are good and are less expensive than calf's liver, but are a little stronger in flavor. Some of the most nutritious meats are found at the bottom of the price list, because we Americans have not learned to cook them. Beef or lamb heart is such a meat, and is good either stuffed with a dressing or pot roasted. With meat rationing, we shall have to cook more stews, meat pies, and pot roasts with delicious 290 gravies, instead of chops and steaks that will call for many more points from our ration book. Recipes for Dinner: Stewed Heart with Rice Border beef heart (about 3 Ibs.) tablespoons cubed onion tablespoons flour tablespoons butter Salt Pepper Whole or half carrots 1 tablespoon vinegar NWN fF Wash heart and remove veins and tough fibres. Cut into pieces and brown slowly in butter. Add water to just cover and simmer 3-4 hours. Add cubed onion and carrots about the last 45 minutes. Before serving, thicken with flour and add the vinegar. Serve with a border of steamed rice, Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serves six. Curried Lamb Shanks with Rice 4 lamb shanks 1 onion 2 tablespoons butter 2-tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons salt \\% tablespoon curry powder Y cup rice (uncooked).

Serves four. Liver Loaf N 14 pounds beef or lamb liver 4 slices bacon 1 onion 14 cup chopped parsley 214 cups soft bread crumbs 1 tablespoon vinegar 2 eggs 2 tablespoons salt \\% tablespoon pepper Put just enough water in pan to cover the bottom. Bring to a boil and drop in the liver, let stand five minutes, then grind with the onion and bacon. Add eggs, crumbs, and seasonings and pack firmly into a loaf pan. Bake 1 hour at 350. Serve with creamed potatoes. May be sliced cold. Liver Roulade Lay slices of calf's, beef or pork liver on slices of bacon. Put a small onion in the center of each and roll up and fasten with tooth picks. Season with salt and pepper. Bake uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons catsup mixed with 14 cup water.

Cheese Pudding 5 slices whole wheat bread 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup grated cheese \\% tablespoon mustard 2 tablespoons chopped onion \\% cup parsley (chopped) 3 eggs (beaten) 2 cups milk Spread bread with butter and cut in cubes. Place in baking dish, add cheese, mustard, onion and parsley. Add warmed milk to eggs and pour over bread mixture. Bake 350 for 30-40 minutes. 'This is a good meat substitute and contains a long list of protective foods such as milk, eggs, cheese, parsley and whole wheat bread. Salads For good health serve salads once a day. Salad bowls or individual salad servings make for variety. There are many combinations for vegetables and fruit salads, and if served crisp and fresh, seasoned with a favorite dressing, they are most delicious. Beet Salad 2 cups diced beetsIf they have not been bottled in vinegar add 1 tablespoon vinegar AN ADEQUATE DAILY DIET 1 cup diced celery 2, tablespoons diced green pepper 1 tablespoon onion juice 1 package lemon jello 2 cups water Mold individually or in large mold on shredded lettuce. Serve with asparagus tips, whole string beans or with shredded cabbage. Chef Salad in Tomato Cheese Ring 2 packages lemon jello 3 cups tomato juice 2 packages cream cheese 1 cup mayonnaise Dissolve gelatin in 114 cups hot tomato juice, when thoroughly dissolved add remaining 114 cups. Mix the cream cheese with mayonnaise and add to the cooled tomato gelatin. Mix well and place in ting mold. Chill in refrigerator until firm. When ready to serve unmold and fill center of ring with the following Chef Salad: Chef Salad 14 small head lettuce, broken in pieces 4 bunch watercress 14 cucumber sliced thin 8-10 radishes sliced thin Y4 cup diced celery 2 sliced hard cooked eggs few strips thinly sliced Swiss or American cheese garlic French dressing Rub the salad bowl with garlic. Put all ingredients into bowl. Pour over just enough French dressing to coat salad Toss lightly and serve at once. Vegetables Properly cooked and _ seasoned vegetables should be a daily \"must\" in our wartime menus. They should be cooked as short a time as possible, in as little water as possible, and should be served as soon as possible after they are cooked. The water left from the cooking of vegetables or from canned vegetables should be used in gravies, soups, or served hot or cold as a drink. Use the green leafy and vellow vegetables often. 291 Desserts Dried fruits \"'as is\" are good, but can be used many other ways. They are always a favorite in pies and cookies. Raisin pie or your favorite oatmeal cookies with raisins never go begging. - Orange Raisin Pudding 2 cups flour 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon soda \\% tablespoon ginger \\% cup suet 14 cup molasses 2 eggs 1 cup applesauce 1 cup seedless raisins % cup orange or citron peel 1 cup fine dry bread crumbs Steam 2 hours, makes 10-12 servings. Serve with orange flavored sauce. Walnut Apricot Pudding 1 cup enriched flour 1 tablespoon baking powder tablespoon soda tablespoon salt cup graham or whole wheat flour cup butter cup honey egg beaten cup orange juice cup chopped dried apricots (or dates, figs, or prunes) cup chopped walnuts tablespoon grated orange rind Sift together first four ingredients. Add graham flour. Melt butter in large saucepan, remove from heat and stir in all other ingredients. Steam 2-3 hours in greased mold. 10-12 servings. Serve with favorite sauce. He Ne SARAK SAN Desserts are usually easy to prepare. Whenever possible, use more of the protective foods in their preparation such as fruits, milk, and eggs. Fresh or canned fruit should be served frequently for dinner or lunch dessert. (Concluded on page 297) Tomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd Chapter II shaking her. Why had Paul done such a thing? It couldn't be so wrong, the way she had packed the panniers. And it was not like Paul to deliberately offend or humiliate anyone. Yet there didn't seem to be a single reason for his actions. J siti stood irresolute, anger She tried to quit shaking, to control the wild impulses that were taking possession of her. She wanted to run and run and never stop running. Her face burned with shame at her own reaction to such a simple offense. What if Paul had thrown things around? What if he had acted childishly? Was it important? Perhaps she hadn't packed the panmiers correctly. She dipped the gourds into the water barrel and dashed a spray over her face. If only he had explained! If there were anything really wrong he could have told her so, even have laughed at her, and she wouldn't have cared. The way it was he had shut her out. There could be only one answer. Paul was tired of trying to initiate her into his world. And if so, what then? Wouldn't it make her own decision easier? Certainly she could leave with more grace. Yet, now strangely, she didn't want to leave. Her fighting spirit was up. She'd sworn never to yield an inch to her surroundings. Then why mind if Paul, or anyone else, thought she couldn't fit? Page 292 'SPOEADY, Janet?\" Paul called, blissfully unconscious of the turmoil he had stirred up. Janet forced a smile and came back to the porch. Paul picked up the panniers. He weighed them judicially, balancing them in either hand, then, satisfied, carried them around the house to the cliff. Janet followed without a word. Paul tied the bundle of bedding and the panniers to the rope that still dangled from the cliff, gave 'Taos instructions for guarding the place, and assured Janet that Juanee and Joe would be back by night. Then he took a crowbar from a nearby shed, pried up a large flat stone from the rear patio and motioned Janet to precede him down the steps that were concealed beneath the stone. He followed, and juggled the stone into place again by balancing it on the flat of his hands above his head. Janet went on through the dim smelly corridor without waiting for Paul.. \"Hey! This is a honeymoon! You act like you're trying to give me the air,\" Paul shouted after her. \"A little air might not be a bad idea in here,\" Janet answered, pausing evasively. \"Say, you know this is not a bad idea, this corridor. I made 'it for fun to begin with. Something to do the long winter. Evenings here alone. Since all the cattle and sheep stealings of the Indians have gone unpunished for so long, the Utes and TOMORROW'S CUP Piutes think they are above the law. If one of them should ever try to get funny with you, Janet, you just remember this crack. You can get to it from the kitchen, too, do you remember? There's a trap door under that big cupboard in the corner behind the middle door... And don't ever get the bottom of the cupboard so full that you can't crawl into it!\" Paul was delighted with the picture he was conjuring up. He couldn't know what terror he had added to Janet's fears, and she would not tell him she was afraid. He didn't know she hated Indians, didn't know that every mummy in his collection haunted her. During the nights when he was gone and she was alone, those shriveled, dusty bones walked the patio. They lent their voices to the wind. They stalked behind her on a path at night. But Paul didn't know. Paul would never know. NCE well into the cliff, the ascent was marked, the air dusty and dry. Janet climbed up the passage with reckless speed, her heart pounding, a wave of blindness threatening to topple her over in her angry defiance. \"Steady, girl,' Paul warned. \"You're climbing too fast. Here, let me get in the lead.\" Paul crowded past her in the narrow passage. His nearness drove fear from Janet's mind. She'd have given anything to laugh and say she didn't need any help, but she was too dizzy to go on. Perhaps she shouldn't have come. But she was glad she had. Here in this dim, man-enlarged corridor there was nothing but Paul and two close walls, which broke 293 occasionally, letting in the sun. There was nothing frightening to stretch away forever and forever. Here was the warmth of his body, his arms to keep her safe, to dissolve her anger. \"Better, Jan? You had me stumped for a minute. You looked scared, or something.\" \"I'm fit as a juniper tree.\" tried to be convincing. Paul scrambled up the ledge, reached down for her hand and helped her up beside him, holding her there awhile to rest. And so, climbing and resting, they came out on top of beautiful Douglas Mesa. At any other time it would have been a breath-taking experience for Janet; now she felt nothing but relief. The sun setting on the buttes across the mesa, blazing against the red rocks, the green junipers, and the blue of an incredulously near sky, was lost to her. There was a sharp pain around her heart and_ her breath was hot in her throat. All of which Paul was too excited to notice. | \"Look at it! See why I swear by this country? No place like it on earth! Look at the elephants marching along the face of the cliffs over there! Headed for their burial grounds, marching, marching. They've been marching thousands of years. And see that break over there to the south? If we could walk over there and look down, there would be the San Juan moving along her green banks to the Colorado. Colotado's her bridegroom. I've seen 'em meet many a time. She eddies around and coquettes a bit and then goes straight to his bosom. Nice gal, the San Juan, Unpredictable, treacherJanet 294 ous, but a bride to love, once you get her tamed!\" Seeing him standing there, his sombrero held reverently at his side, Janet knew the strength of her rival. Paul would never be hers as she wanted her husband to be. This country would claim him body and soul, alive and dead. She'd be a precious part of it, oh, a very precious part, but always secondary. And there was nothing she could do about it. She had never seen a face so lighted up, so passionately proud. Mere grandeur could not account for it. For the first time she realized that Paul's emotion was spiritual. Her fear had been against a physical tival. Now she needed to know more; to understand this new Paul. Perhaps if she tried as determinedly to like his country as she had fostered her hate for it, it might come to be her country, too. For the moment at least, it didn't crowd and push. \"CUESS I'd better get those things pulled up over the cliff and stop orating,\" Paul said apologetically. \"You're shivering!\" Solicitously he wrapped his own warm leather jacket around her shoulders. He said \"The days are warm but the nights are still to be reckoned with.\" A bell tinkled in the distance. Paul put his fingers to his lips and blew a long shrill whistle. A pinto mare neighed answer and came loping from a distant clump of cedars, straight for Paul's outstretched hand. \"Hello there!\" Paul chuckled. \"Smart as a whip, aren't you!\" He patted her nose and let her nuzzle against him. \"T've work for you to do, Lady,\" he confided. \"Pull my bed and board up the cliff. Will you?\" The mare stamped and threw her head nervously. \"She's as smart as they come,\" Paul told Janet. \"Watch her.\" He took a short rope from her saddle. \"I don't often leave a horse saddled up like this (I'd fire a cow hand that did it), but I knew we'd be back soon and the saddle would be safer on her back than on the ground for a thieving Indian.\" He tied the piece of rope to the lasso that hung over the cliff, moved the pinto out a few paces and then gave her the word to stop. She obeyed instantly, one foot still poised. Paul untied the long rope from the projection that had held it; the pack was now in her care. \"Pull 'er up Lady Bird!\" The pinto paced carefully forward, pulling the dangling pack up the cliff behind her. \"Hold!\" The mare stopped instantly, not a muscle moving. Paul pulled the pack over the side of the cliff and away from the edge. The minute she felt the slack rope behind her, the mare trotted back to Paul. He patted her nose and looked to Janet for approval. \"She's a beauty, Paul, I've never seen her in action before.\" The admission was embarrassing. Other women, she knew, rode range with their husbands, knew as much about cattle as the best of them. Some women even managed their own outhts. She'd been so occupied with her rebellion and her personal schemes that she had missed what might have made this country endurable. But it was all so foreign to TOMORROW'S CUP her! Those women were born to the range just as their men were! \"T wish I'd been born here, Paul,\" she said. This morning she'd hated the place; now she almost loved it. If only she could be with Paul all the time she might conquer her fear. \"You don't have to be born in a place to love it. You and I have always been together here in spirit. I recognized that instantly.\" He smiled a whimsical, endearing smile. \"Sometime you'll recognize it too.\" HEY camped that night in a big cave clinging to the mesa. \"Hotel Collins!\" Paul announced. They had come down to the cave on foot, along a trail that wound down from the top, and now stood looking out over the canyon to the other side, their eyes tracing the trail to the canyon floor. Green against red, red deepening to purple where the shadows fell, fading to pink and then to white in the path of the sun. Janet took a long shivering breath. \"Steady, girl!\" Paul urged her back from the edge. \"The sight makes me heady at times. You're tired. A good bacon and eggs supper will set you up.\" In the center of the cave under an opening in the roof, he built a small fire; he carried the bags down from the top, and while he waited for the fire to burn to coals he made a bed of boughs, topped by a heavy sheepskin robe that he found hanging from a point of rock in the cave; on that he spread the blankets from their pack, He patted the bed. \"You'll sleep like a dead Injun till I call you to breakfast,\" he laughed. Janet was startled at the sudden recurrence of fear. Just when you 295 had the thing licked it sprang out at you again. In the form of a word Indian, a rattlesnake in a bush, the howl of a wolf at night, or just in no form at all. She shivered. A bat flew from the cave into a darker crevice, Paul stirred the fire. \"The robe is hotel property,\" he said to make conversation. \"It's been here for years. It's worth fifty dollars. If it had been a salt and pepper shaker it'd have disappeared the first night.\" He settled the frying pan over the coals. \"Funny about people!\" JANET had never tasted such good food. They sat in the door after supper and watched the stars. Paul talked earnestly, reassuringly, and again Janet's fears slipped away. An owl greeted the dark night, leaving a velvet silence. Janet slipped her hand into Paul's. \"Afraid?\" he teased, putting his arms around her. \"Of course not, silly. I'm just shiveringly happy.\" \"T hoped you'd say that. It's we two together for always, isn't it?\" \"We three,\" Janet corrected involuntarily. Paul caught his breath and Janet could hear his heart. \"You meana baby? Oh, Janet, girl, don't speak. Not yet for a minute. I've got to see heaven a bit at a time!\" Wholly possessive of him, the world shut out, Janet was happier than she had ever been in her life. \"Are youall right?\" Paul asked after a time. \"You seemed faint back there in the corridor. I thought it was from climbing too fast. Perhaps I should'nt have brought you here?\" 296 \"Nonsense, Paul. [T'm as well as anything.\" \"How long have you known, Janet?\" \"Only a short time.\" \"Were you... Glad?\" \"Of course. Only I felt for a while the way I felt the first time I looked at the San Juan Goosenecks, 1200 feet below me, I wanted to clutch something solid and hang on for dear life!\" \"T wish Id been there. Janet you're wonderful!\" Tuer went to bed then, talking little. The cave, the silence, the closeness of the stars made Janet feel that she and Paul were primr tively alone, beginning a world together. \"What a country!\" Paul said softly. \"A little new cow hand. A <ia~> pardner all my own!\" And he went to sleep. Janet's mind sprang to attention. Cow hand! Yes. She'd forgotten. Her baby would grow up to be a cow hand. He'd fight and die for this all-forsaken country just as Paul was doing. There'd be no Harvard, no football, no cultural existence. Indians and cowboys and cows! She sat up, struggling for breath. \"Not if I can help it!\" she stated audibly. \"I'll fight you, Paul. You and your country. Fight you till the day I dic. I'll not bring my child up in this place!\" Paul sighed contentedly in his sleep. The night owl communed with himself in the darkness outside. Janet slid terrified down into the warm bed.

Though she had minor colds at later intervals, she was never again bothered with any serious lung trouble up to the time of her death. It was the tenth day of August, 1853, when Israel Ivins, tired but happy, drove into Salt Lake and stopped before the comfortable home of his friend, Jedediah M. Grant, on Main Street. Brother Grant immediately set about to make the little family comfortable, and lost no time in bringing them into the house where they were invited to stay for a short time while planning for the immediate future. So Rachel slept comfortably that night, sheltered by the first roof that had covered her head for several months, and little dreaming it was the roof of her future home.

Careless cooking, indifferent seasoning, and unattractive service will do much to discourage the \"fussy eater\"; while a pleasing color plan, having green, yellow, red, and white in the meal; contrasting textures, a crispy crunchy food to balance the soft creamy one; contrasting temperatures such as hot soup, cold salad; and variation in shape, a square of meat loaf and a mound of mashed potatoes, will help to make the family like and eat the great variety of fine food we Americans have. 3 PACKAGES 25 BENNETT GLASS & PAINT CO.

The artist has caught the moment in the serving of the meal when the small child is being helped over a difficult word as she says grace. The scene is tenderly and sympathetically portrayed. Chardin was born the son of a cabinetmaker. Under his master, Aved, he gained something of his teacher's enthusiasm for the art of the Dutch painters. He was admitted to the Academy at the age of twenty-nine by which time he had earned renown with his genre scenes.

Green The throaty song of the meadow lark, The blackbird's trill in the rush, The purple violet hiding low In the damp of the grasses lush, Sends a throbbing thrill intense as pain To my heart, and memories bring Of days long dead; but their spirits sweet Linger yet in the breath of spring. The saucy gray chipmunk chattering, The trout in the mountain brook, The pussy willow soft and shy In a shadowy, sheltered nook, With a magic spell my youth restores And I long 'mong the hills to roam As once in that sweet lost long ago Where rocks teased the water to foam. The bees abuzz in the lazy warmth On the sunny side of a bank, The musty smell of the rotting leaves At the roots of new grasses rank, Fan embers of fires that burned long ago And struck a responsive string On the harp of my heart, asleep so long, With recurrence of lovely spring. VOL. 30,NO. 5 MAY 1943 113th Annual Conference Elder Bryant S. Hinckley HERE is no other gathering in 'L'a world just like a general conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Laymen and leaders come from all the vast territory covered by the stakes of Zion. These conferences have a social and economic, as well as a spiritual value. The local leaders from wards and branches gather in Salt Lake City, the headquarters of the Church, for instruction, inspiration, and to transact the necessary business of the Church. They hear the annual reports, financial and otherwise, sustain with their vote the General Authorities of the Church, and go home refreshed in spirit and renewed in faith. These gatherings give solidarity to the whole body of the Church, unify and harmonize its plans and purposes, stimulate the faith of the members, and encourage the leaders to greater endeavor. Owing to the war, the attendance at the 113th annual conference was restricted to the Priesthood leaders and admission to the conference sessions was by card. The meetings were held on April 4th, sth, and 6th, in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. A new feature was the holding of regional conferences on the two Sundays following, at which representatives of the General Authorities were in attendance to carry over the spirit and message of the general conference. President Grant was present at all of the sessions of this conference except one. Yielding to the advice of his physician he did not speak, but dictated an address which was read by President David O. McKay. From the opening sentence, \"To the Latterday Saints all over the world, I send my love and greetings,\" to the final paragraph of this inspired message, the vast audience listened with rapt attention and were thrilled by what the venerable leader had to say. Among other things, the President said, \"My heart goes out in the deepest sympathy and in the most sincere and earnest prayer that I have ever offered for the comforting ifluence of the Lord to be given to the brethren and sisters who have sons in the war at the present time. I pray that Page 301 302 the Lord will bless each and every boy who has been called or who has gone into the service, and that He will help each of them to live in accordance with the principles of the Gospel, so that each may havea claim to the blessings of the Lord.... I pray that, so far as it accords with the providence of the Lord, each of them may be preserved from accident, sickness, and death, to return in due course to his loved ones. I pray God to help them to stand up under the terrible strain which they must meet. I appeal to the Lord to bring the war to an end at the earliest possible date. My heart goes out to all of you.... I want to thank the people for their prayers in my behalf. I have not been well now for a period of more than three years, and yet during all that time I have never suffered any pain. My days have been full of joy. I have seen the Church grow _.. As I have never seen it grow before.... Years ago I made a short speech that lasted a minute and a half to the effect that we were architects of our own lives, and that we and we alone are responsible for not making a success of life. What I said was as follows: 'If you want to know how to be saved, I can tell you; it is by keeping the commandments of God. No power on earth, no power beneath the earth, will ever prevent you or me or any Latter-day Saint from being saved, except ourselves. We are the architects of our own lives, not only of the lives here, but the lives to come in the eternity. We ourselves are able to perform every duty and obligation that God has required of men. No commandment was ever given to us but that God has given us the power to keep that commandment. If we fail, we, and we alone, are responsible for the failure, because God endows His servants from the President of the Church down to the humblest member, with all the ability, all the knowledge, all the power that is necessary, faithfully, diligently, and properly to discharge every duty and every obligation that rests upon them, and we, and we alone, will have to answer if we fail in this regard.' \" 'These words were uttered forty years ago. They were true then and they are true now. Continuing he said, \"I am grateful to our Heavenly Father for the faith and faithfulness of this great people, for their devotion to His service, for their effort and determination to live in accordance with His laws and commandments. I thank our Heavenly Father that He has given them the strength and courage to resist evils as well as they have been able to do so. I pray that He will bless the youth of the Church and give them strength to overcome temptation. I pray that He will bring into the heart of every boy, and of every girl a knowledge that cleanliness is next to godliness, that they must live clean both in mind and in body, that they will understand that the sin of unchastity is to the Lord next to the sin of murder. I pray that the Lord will give to the parents of the youth an understanding and appreciation of the dangers and temptations to which their children are subjected, that they may be led and guided to encourage their children, to direct them, to teach them how to live as the Lord would have them live. The Lord has said He would sift His people, and I pray that when that sifting 113th ANNUAL CONFERENCE comes no parent may have failed to do his duty, and no child shall have failed to obey the commandments of the Lord.\" RESIDENT J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Gave the concluding address of the Priesthood meeting Monday night. His manner was modest and impressive. His words clear, convincing, and authoritative, findin lodging in the minds of all who heard them. His appeal had a spiritual force and an effectiveness altogether uncommon. He pointed out the responsibility of the leaders of the Church with reference to the Latterday Saint boys in the armed service of the country. He began his remarks by asking how many had themselves served in the armed forces of the nation during the World War I then he asked who of those. Present had sons now serving in the army, and then he added those who had grandsons, and then those who had sons and grandsons subject to service in the war. Approximately half of the congregation of Priesthood officers in the Church were on their feet. This, he said, was an indication of the far reaching effects of the war. He told of the publications of literature for these service men in the form of a pocket edition of the Book of Mormon, a book on the principles of the Gospel, and a small Church Directory. \"Our young men in the armed forces will need all of our faith and prayers and all that they can get from these books to help them live righteously.\" He referred to the commandment, \"Honor thy father and thy mother\" and then stressed the responsibility of Latter-day Saints to care properly 303 for their families. \"\"The Church,\" he declared, \"is prepared, with your help and assistance, to take care of those who need such assistance, and if any of the Saints have cast their parents off see if you can not get them to take them back... If they need help in this let them go to the Bishops and get it in the right way.... If we assume the obligations which God has given to us, we will care for our own.... Do not be lulled to sleep by any... Slogan as that the State ' owes to every man a subsistence.\" President Clark gave a new definition for needy in the Church Welfare Program. He said the Church has always regarded those in need as those being without food or the necessities of life. 'Today there is a new group in need of help. This group includes any man or woman who, in this emergency, is in need of help to harvest his crops or to keep. His business going. He advocated this as a new approach for quorum activities and urged the men of the Priesthood to organize and take over this responsibility. He declared that marriage should be one of the holiest ordinances into which members of the Church can enter. He discouraged marriage by our young people with those who are not members of the Church for frequently such marriages end in tragedy. He said, \"Every consideration of faith, principles of right living, Church doctrine, and Church standards, requires that we should guard, as we would guard our lives, the chastity of our girls. There are all kinds of influences at work to break down these standards. I was told the other day that we have a new phrase, that young girls who 304 smoke and drink and may be doing other things talk about \"new Mormons\" as distinguished from the \"old Mormons.\" I wish to say to them that those who abandon the standards and principles of the Church are not Mormons at all,\" and, \"I urge you young women and girls to remember that in the schedule of crimes, unchastity comes next to murder. Do not subject yourselves to its penalty.\" He said the members of the Church are called upon now to sacrifice their sons but because they have to sacrifice their sons is no reason why they should sacrifice their daughters. President Clark, concluded with this impressive observation: \"What a tragic spectacle man is showing to his God today. We have rightly boasted for nearly a hundred years that in this, the Last Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, the Lord was pouring out His inspiration and His blessings upon all the world, unlocking to His children secrets that never were dreamed of by the ancients, giving them powers and dominions over the forces of nature, bringing under subjection almost the universe. Look at what the last century has given us in art, literature, science, discoveries, for our blessing and advancement. God gave all this to us to bless us. And then consider that now, in this terrible hour, every device, every invention, every discovery God gave us to bless us is being used to destroy one another in one of the most barbarous wars of all time. God will not hold guiltless those responsible for this holocaust.\" PRESIDENT David O. McKay's address was a clear and eloquent declaration of the ideals of Mormonism as they should be lived today by every Latter-day Saint. To the people of the nation and to the Latter-day Saints, President McKay voiced this vital admonition: \"While our sons, sweethearts, and husbands are offering their lives in defense of the God-given gift of Free Agency and for the right to live without the domination of tyranny, let us in the 'Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as citizens of our beloved country, use our influence to see that men and women of upright character, of unimpeachable honor are elected to office, that our homes are kept unpolluted and unbroken by infidelity, that children therein will be trained to keep the commandments of the Lord, 'to be honest, true, chaste, benevolent and virtuous, and to do good to all men.'\" He held the home as the second essential element in the building and perpetuity of a great people. He said, \"If, and when the time comes that parents shift to the State the responsibility of rearing their children, the stability of the Nation will be undermined, and its impairment and disintegration will have begun.\" He scored the increasing divorce rate in the United States as a threatening menace to this nation's greatness. Race suicide and tandem polygamous relationships made possible by lax divorce laws are enemies of ideal national life. The increase throughout the United States in the percentage of divorces is alarming. And _ this insidious evil is increasing in the Church. There are too many couples in the Church, who when trouble 113th ANNUAL CONFERENCE arises, seek solution in the divorce courts. In discussing the home as the most important factor in building a great nation, President McKay declared that the most vicious enemy to home life is immorality. 'This corroding evil\" he said, \"is just as demoralizing to the young man as to the young woman.\" More than thirty discourses were delivered at the conference, every one of which was permeated with hope, encouragement, and the spirit of eternal truth. There were fervent testimonies borne and many messages of real eloquence given that will enrich the literature of the Church. The contribution which religion should make to the home, to the nation, and to society were clearly and forcefully presented. 305 The Church of the Air Address on Sunday morning, April 4th, which was a part of the general conference was given by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, \"Blessed Is the Nation Whose God Is the Lord.\" Although the attendance at the conference was restricted to the Priesthood leadership, its spirit and influence will reach to the remotest corner and branch of the Church. Frequent reference was made to the Church Welfare Program. The annual report showed that the Relief Society had disbursed to the needy $371,442. This large sum does not represent a tithe of the contribution of this great and benevolent society to the welfare of the people of the Church. LORD, LET MY PRAYERS FOR OTHERS BE Irene R. Davis My soul, oppressed, sought Thee to tell My secret needs and woes. And still I groped and strove in dark; to find That I was lost, and hope was blind. In vain I prayed, my heart outpoured! I somehow failed to reach Thee, Lord. I prayed for wisdom. Now I see, My prayers were always prayers for me. My woes and needs and cares came first; No thought to slake my brother's thirst; Lord, let my prayers for others be; Perhaps someone will pray for me. PRESIDENT AND MRS. HEBER J. GRANT PRESIDENT AND MRS. HEBER J. GRANT OBSERVE. WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 'THIS, the latest picture taken together of President and Sister Grant, is a hitherto unpublished one. With its publication, the General Board, on behalf of the entire membership of the Relief Society, congratulates this distinguished and revered couple upon arriving, on May twenty-sixth, at the fifty-ninth milestone of their married life. This photograph, taken in the out-of-doors in which they both delight, reflects an alert expression on both of their faces, showing that at the age of eighty-six they still enjoy life to the fullest. It is our heartfelt desire that they may continue throughout their lives to enjoy health and happiness. Page 306 Teach Tithing In the Home. Presiding Bishop LeGrand Richards N the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood there is considerable attention given to the teaching of the law of tithing. Young men are taught that one-tenth of their increase belongs to the Lord. They are taught that this divine command from our Heavenly Father applies, with equal force, to each member of the Church, whether young or old. They are taught that income, not age, determines the obligation. Too frequently our youth grow up under the impression that the payment of tithing may, or even should be, deferred until maturity. Inquiry and observation reveal that in a great many cases Our young people become acquainted with the law of tithing for the first time in the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood or in the classes of the various auxiliary organizations of the Church. In such instances this means that they have never been taught tithing by their parents in the home. If they become acquainted with this law of the Lord, they must receive this information and training outside the parental home. This is not as the Lord would have it. The obligation for teaching young people rests first upon father and mother in the home. The quorums of the Priesthood and the auxiliary organizations of the Church serve as supplements and aids to the home, but in no way relieve parents of their responsibility to teach their children to obey the commandments of the Lord. Failure to teach our sons and daughters to pay an honest tithe brings them under the Lord's stinging indictment \"'... Ye have robbed me.\" Innocently they inquire, \"Wherein have we robbed thee?\" The reply, \"In tithes and offerings\" will prompt their plea of innocence but their guilt is none the less real. And all of this they suffer largely because parents failed them during the tender and impressionable years of youth. It is a safe conclusion that parents generally fail to teach their children the law of tithing because they themselves have not been obedient thereto. A father or a mother who pays an honest tithe is always proud to have sons and daughters know that this obligation has been discharged, and to have them do likewise. But the parent who pays little or no attention to this commandment frequently seeks to justify his disobedience by attempting to discredit the validity of this law of the Lord. He may even go so far as to discourage his children's obedience in order that he may experience the sinful comfort of companionship in disobedience. From various sections of the Church there are numerous examples coming to light which attest the effectiveness of the teachings of the Aaronic Priesthood quorums and other Church organizations relative to the law of tithing. Young men and young women whose parents have never paid tithing are faithful in returning one-tenth to the Lord. Still other parents have become converted to the payment of tithing when their sons and daughters have Page 307 308 set the example in th taithful dis- 'charge 'of 'this 'obligation. This is commendable but it does not justify the shift of this responsibility from the parental home to the Church organizations. It may some day be embarrassing for children to be obliged to give to the Church, instead of their parents, the credit for teaching them the law of tithing. It will be still more embarrassing when our Heavenly Father inquires of parents as to why they neglected this parental duty. Many children today, some young and some now grown to maturity, are being denied the great blessings attendant upon the payment of tithing because their parents did not teach them while in the home to obey this law. It is in this way that the Lord visits \"... The iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation....\" Surely, no parent can feel happy about his neglect when it means that his children are not entitled to the blessings they otherwise would have received had they been taught to pay an honest tithe. The ideal situation is for our young people to be properly taught and trained in the home to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, and then receive the supplementary teachings in the Priesthood quorums | and the auxiliary organizations of the Church. The home and the Church working unitedly together will accomplish a marvelous work and perform a. Noble mission in the training of the youth of Zion. One instance of this cooperation between the home and the Church reveals that sixty-six young men residing in two wards in the same stake, came up through the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood where the law of tithing received its proper emphasis, and during their first year as ordained elders paid an average tithe of $77.12 each. These young men had faithfully paid their tithing during the years they served as deacons, teachers, and priests, with the result that when they were ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood the teachings of the home and the Church together had become an integral part of their lives. This is as the Lord would have it. This is the way we may bind Him to His promised blessings which He anxiously waits to pour out upon the faithful everywhere. May is here! The air is fresh and sunny; And the miser-bees are busy Hoarding golden honey. Thomas Bailey Aldrich. She Let Her Light So Shine Edith Smith Elhott Member of Relief Society General Board HE Salt Lake City Council of Women chose 1943 to be a banner year in the lives of women, the year to select new members for their Hall of Fame. Twice before they have made an occasion to honor women who have been outstanding in the community. This year the nominations were made by organizations affiliated with the Council, and later the voting by club presidents or delegates resulted in the choice of seven women who have given service unsolicited to their community in various fields of progress. The members of the Relief Society were delighted to have their President, Amy Brown Lyman, recognized. Her life has been one of continual contribution to the welfare of her fellow men. Other women selected for the same honor were: Dr. Maud May Babcock, Judge Reva Beck Bosone, Mrs. W. F. Core, Mrs. Arthur E. Graham, Mrs. R. W. Fisher, and Mrs. Lula Greene Richards. The Council employed various means to acquaint the public with the wonderful contributions made by those they honored. Beginning March 11, 1943, a unique series of radio programs was presented. Each day for seven days, a fifteen-minute program was broadcast over radio station KSL which gave interesting glimpses into the lives of the new members of the Hall of Fame. The series was capably ditected by Louise Hill Howe of KSL. Priscilla L. Evans, member of the General Board, had charge of gathering the material to be presented PRESIDENT AMY BROWN LYMAN AND MASTER CANDLE SYMBOLIC OF ACHIEVEMENTS RECOGNIZED IN HER ELECTION TO THE HALL OF FAME for Mrs. Lyman. Mrs. Lyman's biographical sketch was given March 18, 1943. An interesting account of the achievements of our beloved President clearly indicated why she was selected for-this award. The evening of March 20, 1943, the Salt Lake City Council of Women further honored their selectees at a large public reception in the Junior Ballroom of the Hotel Utah. In the receiving line were Mrs. Ed F. Shepherd, president of the Council, Mrs. Emily S. Stewart, reception chairPage 309 310 man, Mrs. Grant Gregerson and Mrs. Junius Fisher, assistants to Mrs. Stewart, and the honored women. The reception lasted for one hour, during which hundreds of friends took advantage of the privilege to congratulate the guests of honor. Many state and civic officials were among those who called. President and Mrs. Heber J. Grant paid honor to the occasion by attending the reception, as did other Latter-day Saint Church officials. A large banquet in the Lafayette Ballroom followed. The reception. Approximately 300 dinner guests greeted the famous women as they entered and took their places at the speaker's table. A program followed the dinner. Mrs. Stewart welcomed those assembled. She introduced the program chairman, Mrs. Irma Felt Bitner, who outlined the events to follow. The introduction to the program was made by Council President Mrs. Ed F. Shepherd. She briefly and graciously outlined the outstanding characteristics of each of the seven elect ladies. At the completion of her talk, playlets or skits were presented from the stage in the ballrooom, depicting phases of interest from the lives of those honored. The General Board of the Relief Society took charge of the skits for President Amy Brown Lyman and Mrs. Lula Greene Richards, the first editor of the Woman's Exponent and an active participator in Relief Society endeavor. The literary committee of the General Board, under the chairmanship of Mrs. Rae B. Barker, arranged the skit for Mrs. Richards. Mary Grant Judd wrote and directed it, emphasizing her lit erary gifts, spirituality, and charm. Edith Smith Elliott was chairman of the committee to arrange the playlet narrating Mrs. Lyman's gifts and attainments. The skit, a collaboration by Mrs. Elliott, Mrs. Vilate Raile, and Mr. Francis Urry of KSL, was built around the following paragraph taken from Mrs. Lyman's autobiography, \"In Retrospect\": Our home, a one and one-half story adobe house, was lighted with kerosene lamps and candleslamps for downstairs and candles for upstairs. The candles were molded by my Mother's own hands. As we ascended the stairs each evening, a mark on the candle indicated how long we could study or visit or play before we retired. Can't we all picture little Amy Brown eager to crowd as much development as possible into the time that the flame of the candle could shed its warmth and light? The miniature drama opened with the stage very simply set. On the stage left front was a microphone. At the right front was a small oldfashioned table and armchair. On the table was a lighted candle in a candlestick. In the center at the back of the stage were some ragcarpeted stairs, and on each side of the stairs were tall seven-branch candelabra holding eighteen-inch white tapers.. After a brief introduction by the narrator, Helen Ann Young of KSL, the spotlight was thrown off the left of the stage. While a string trio played \"Lead Kindly Light,\" Amy Kathryn Lyman, a granddaughter of President Lyman, appeared carrying a large book representing her grandmother's autobiography. She was dressed in pale pink chiffon which emphasized the beauty of her blonde SHE LET HER LIGHT SO SHINE hair and fair skin. She stood before the microphone and said: \"Reading from the autobiography of my grandmother, Amy Brown Lyman, I came upon this paragraph.\" She then read the paragraph referred to above. While she read, Mrs. Lyman's daughter, Mrs. Margaret Lyman Schreiner, came onto the stage dressed as Mrs. Lyman's mother. She sat in the chair by the oldfashioned table. Four children came in next and gathered around Mother Brown who went through the motions of lighting the candle. In pantomime she explained the mark on the candle, kissed each child goodnight and sent them up the ragcarpeted stairs, and then went off the stage. Three of the children were Richard, John, and Gretchen Schreiner, grandchildren of President Lyman. The fourth, Shauna Stewart, played the part of little Amy Brown at about the age of twelve years. Following this episode, Amy Kathryn mused: The idea intrigued me. I visualized my grandmother as a little girl, in a gray linseywool dress, her dark hair combed smoothly from her face. In my mind I could see her eyes fastened on the mark her mother had made on the candle she carried, and I know she was hoping it would burn slowly that she might get as much reading done as possible. Again and again I thought of her letting a brother or a sister light a candle from hers, and of the uncountable times she has let others light theirs also. I thought of the dark corners into which she carried her lighted candle. Then suddenly I knew it was because she carried a \"candle,\" because she shared her \"light\" with thousands of others that she is a great and noble woman. In fancy through the years I seem to see her as she goes about lighting many 311 candles to increase the ever-glowing brilliance of the lightthe torch first placed in her hands by Deity and kindly parents. At this point, little Amy Brown appeared coming back down the stairs with a lighted candle in her hand and began to light the tapers in the tall candelabra, each representing the light that Mrs. Lyman has shared in different fields of progress. As each candle was lighted, Amy Kathryn recited the accomplishment which the candle represented: 1. As a homesteader she shed her light in the desert, helping to make it blossom as the rose. 2. She did volunteer service at Hull House with Jane Addams. 3. She shared her knowledge with others in the field of teaching. 4. Her home is a place of gentleness, culture, refinement, and hospitality. 5. As a legislator she used rare judgment. 6. She fosters fine arts in her family and community.: 7. She has programmed intelligently for the underprivileged at American Fork. 8. She served nine years as an officer in the National Council of Women. G. Grandmother was a delegate six times to the conventions of the International Council of Women. 10. A pioneer in social welfare, nationally and internationally. 11. She has given generously of her means, time, and talents in patriotic endeavor. 12. As a missionary in Europe she spread the light of Christianity. 13. Established the \"Amy Brown Lyman Loan Fund\" to help girls with their education at the Brigham Young University. 14. Crowning the activities of her life's work of service, she presides today over the National Woman's Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintsmembership 115,000 members. (Continued on page 347) A Tribute to May Green Hinckley Adele C. Howells, LaVerne W. Parmley The Counselors to Mrs. Hinckley in General Presidency of Primary MAY GREEN HINCKLEY AY Green Hinckley was born in Brampton, Derbyshire, England. She came to Utah with her mother when she was six years old. Her life has been one of faith and service. She has been active in the Church since her early girlhood. She served as a teacher in the Sunday School and in the Young Women's Mutual Improve- 'ment Association. From 1907- 1909 she served as a missionary in the Central States Mission. Upon returning home, she served as president of the Granite Stake Y. W. M. LA. For twelve years. In January of 1936, she was called with her husband, Bryant S. Hinckley, to preside over the Northern Page 312 States Mission. Soon after their release from the mission field, the First Presidency appointed her general president of the Primary Association, which position she held until her death on May 2, 1943. May Hinckley was an able executive and leader in her many and varied positions. She was a tireless worker and had unlimited energy. She knew how to work a little longer, a little harder, and a little better than most people. She had vision, understanding, good judgment, and enthusiasm. In her love and devotion for the work of the Lord she forgot self. As president of the Primary organization, the only desire of her heart has been to help the officers and teachers in the field that they might better teach the children to pray and to walk uptightly before the Lord. She served in humility and love. May Hinckley was endowed with the attributes of true success. She had a grateful heart, a thoughtful mind, a friendly smile, a kindly word, a helpful hand, and a loyal and courageous spirit. The beautiful floral tributes banked high on the stand in the Salt Lake Assembly Hall where her funeral services were held on Wednesday, May 5s, and the large attendance attested to the great love and esteem in which May' Hinckley was held. In her death, hundreds of people have lost a true friend; the Primary organization has lost a devoted leader; the Church has lost a loyal, faithful member; and the community has lost a great woman. Rachel Ridgway Ivins Grant Mary Grant Judd Member of Relief Society General Board (Part I of this two-part article appeared in the April issue.) RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT AND HER SON HEBER This picture was taken on President Grant's ninth birthday. N a December morning of the year 1856, it was bitingly cold in Salt Lake City. Dark and sombre it appeared to Rachel Ivins Grant, a pioneer wife who lay ill with her first-born, a son, in' an oldfashioned cradle beside her. On November twenty-second, the baby had been born and his life had almost cost her own. _It was but a few days before the birth of the son, that the father, Page 313 314 Jedediah M. Grant, a vigorous man in the prime of life, had collapsed. The strain of his responsibilities and the unusual efforts he had put forth as leader in the religious movement of that time known as the Reformation, had caused his health to break. A brief and severe illness attacked him, and when the baby Heber was nine days old, Rachel's husband died. On this morming when her husband was to be buried, she lay in her room on the second floor of the comfortable adobe dwelling which had been her home during the three short years of her married life. Later she heard the funeral throngs coming and going below and wished that she might have been able to attend the services for her husband which were to be held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle; for Jedediah M. Grant had been a man of prominence in the community, being not only mayor of the City, but also second counselor to President Brigham Young. It was three o'clock in the afternoon before Rachel heard the last strains of a funeral march die away and knew that this seemingly endless day would soon come to a close. How alone she felt only those can realize who, like herself, have forsaken friends and home for an unpopular religion. With the exception of an older sister Anna, her only kin was the small bundle of humanity beside her. This baby was all that she had to live and work for. She must have thought that here was her task; to teach her son of the father he had never known, and make of him the sort of man that father would have wished his son to be. How well she accomplished her high design, there are thousands to attest today. Rachel was left with but meagre financial resources. To earn a livelihood for herself and her boy she did fine hand sewing. But this class of work brought in so little, for the longspent hours, that she found it impossible to get ahead, and as time went by, it became increasingly hard for her to live on at the Grant homestead. When Rachel's son was six years old, it was decided among the heirs of Jedediah M. Grant to sell this property on Main Street (where Z. C. M. I. Now stands), and divide the proceeds. Rachel's share was five hundred dollars with which she bought a tiny home on Second East Street just below South Temple. Here, in hard circumstances, the young Heber was given \"the advantages of poverty\" and learned to appreciate his mother's independence of spirit as she uncomplainingly assumed the entire financial burden of her home. Thirty years later, speaking of these hard times in a letter to her son, Rachel had this to say: \"I never felt humiliated at having to work and support myself and you, and I thanked my Heavenly Father for giving me the strength and ability to do it. When talking to President Young I said if the Lord would give me health and strength, it was all I asked. And when thinking of many things I have passed through, hard and unpleasant, how happy it makes me now that I never complained, not even to my sister. I knew she would feel bad. I can talk about them now without caring.\" RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT Denying themselves all but the bare necessities of life, Rachel and Heber decided that they must save for one of the wonderful new sewing machines that were newly on the market. And when it was hers, the ambitious mother, after sewing all day in some other woman's house, would often return home, prepare supper, and when she and Heber had cleared away the meal and washed and wiped the dishes, she would go at her sewing again, working far into the night. The touching picture of her little boy sitting on the floor and, with his hands, working the treadles of the machine so that her tired limbs could rest, is one that has misted the eyes of many listeners of President Heber J. Grant's sermons as he eulogized his mother. \"Being Mother's -only child,\" he once said, \"we have been very dear to each other. I doubt if a mother and son were ever any nearer for she was both father and mother to me. Her tender love bound me to her with cords of steel.\" Rachel's was a very hospitable nature and she did not let her limited financial resources deter herself and her son from entertaining their friends. The little home saw frequent gatherings. \"Yes,\" she said later in speaking of those times, \"they loved to come and I loved to have them. Ofttimes Heber and I would live on very scanty fare that we might have the greater pleasure of sharing with our friends. 'Sister Grant,' the boys would say, 'we have such good times here.' \" N spite of her hardships, Rachel was happy in Utah, happier than she had been at an earlier date in 315 New Jersey, since physical hardships are always easier to bear than mental anxieties. So when her brother wrote from the East begging her to return and offering to settle upon her a substantial annuity for life, she declined to accept his offer; for there was a condition attachedshe must tenounce Mormonism for good and all and this she could not do. It was dearer to her than life itself. Rachel developed for herself, and taught her son, a philosophy of life that was simple and satisfying. She accepted her religion with childlike faith and left the mysteries for others to solve. She believed in the innate goodness of man springing from the actuality of God as his Father; that a Divine Providence makes and \"Shapes our lives and that no matter what happens, all will come right in the end. Her motto was, \"It is all for the best.\" Her son says of her: \"So near to the Lord would she get in her prayers that they were a wonderful source of inspiration to me from childhood to manhood. When success came she was thankful; when a child was born she thanked the Lord; and when a loved one died she always felt to acknowledge the hand of the Lord.\" While Rachel was still a young woman and Heber a lad, she had opportunity of putting her philosophy to the test. Could she say of the fresh trial that came, \"It is all for the best?\" Yes, she could and did. Following a severe attack of quinsy, she commenced losing her hearing and eventually was almost totally deaf. 'This tragic handicap she patiently bore to the close of her long life. Never again could she 316 hear or join in the congregational singing which she loved. Neither could she listen to the sermons of the brethren. Heber learned to throw his voice in a sharp staccato and could make her hear him when he was across the room, but all others had to place their mouths close against her ear to be understood. But though she could not hear what was going on, Rachel still attended her meetings to partake of the sacrament and enjoy the spirit of the occasion. And, in some inexplicable way, her thoughts were directed in the same channels as those of the speakers. 'This was especially true in the regular monthly fast meetings. She was a beautiful speaker and loved to bear her testimony. Often she would arise and speak right along the same line of thought which had been developed by the others. She continued the custom in her home of having family prayers night and morning. She would take her turn, even though she could not hear her own voice, and when it became Heber's turn he would kneel beside her and pray into her ear. With characteristic optimism Rachel discovered, among the many trying features of her deafness, some phases to be grateful for. She was spared much of the noise and confusion with which others were troubled, and it was so difficult for people to make her hear that they didn't bother to relay her gossip or anything of the kind. She expressed her attitude in these words: \"I grieve that I cannot hear, but while I cannot hear much of the good that is spoken, my peace is not marred by the evil that is spoken.\" Her son says of her: \"My mother was one of the most even-tempered and best dispositioned women that I have ever known.. I have often wished that I could have such a calm, peaceful temperament as she had. I do not recall ever seeing her angry or hearing her speak an unkind word.\" Rachel's natural friendliness, understanding, and sympathy, offset her handicap of deafness. People loved to be in her society and she loved people. She was made president of the Thirteenth Ward Relief Society and served in this charitable organization in this capacity for over thirty years. In season and out she visited the sick, went to the house of mourning, even caring for the dead, and, in every way, relieved suffering and distress. Her son says: \"Her absolute confidence in the hereafter was a great source of comfort and blessing in the hour of death to all with whom she came in contact.\" In early days there were no formal organizations centrally directing the several ward Relief Societies, the general board being a later development. 'There was, however, a group known as \"the leading women of the church\" and of this group Rachel formed a part. Here she was intimately associated with such outstanding characters as Eliza R. Snow, Bathsheba Smith, Emmeline B. Wells and others. As the widow of Jedediah M. Grant and an individual well-born in her own right, she retained the association and interest of the leaders of the Church, particularly President Brigham Young. As a boy, Heber had been playing on the floor at home when kindly RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT Bishop Woolley, father of the Thirteenth Ward, had called upon his mother and proffered the help of the ward to fix the leaky roof of her home.: He had heard her reply: \"I do not wish to be supported by the Church, I am too independent for that. 'The roof can wait until my son is older and can earn money enough to have it fixed.\" The young boy was greatly impressed by his mother's confidence in him. Then and there the financial aspect of life took on great importance as he resolved to repay her at the earliest possible time for her sacrifices in his behalf. This accounts for the fact that he left school at an early age and went into business for himself where he was signally successful. He lived to see the day when he was able to give his mother all the comforts of life. The religious teachings of his mother, however, and her fervent desire for him to emulate the example of his father and give his chief allegiance, not to business, but to his Church, were the determining factors in helping him to shape his life into what it has become. He learned that there are other things in life far more important than wealth. \"It is a glorious thing,\" he says, \"to be, like Nephi of old, 'born 317 of goodly parents,' it is of more worth than wealth or precious stones. No boy on earth could have had a better mother, and if I succeed in the battle of life, I will owe it all to her.\" Herein lay, not only Rachel's greatest joy, but a power above all unsought by her, which has perpetuated her name and made it shine out as one of the brightest among the women of the Church. When Rachel was eighty-one years old (seven years before her death), the following poem by Paul Shivell as being applicable to herself was sent her: \"Thou art the chosen mother of a son, Sent to thy care from heaven, as thou wert sent, To carry on the work by Christ begun, Who came from heaven to show us what God meant. As Mary was exalted by the event Which gave us Christ, so if thou give us one To do God's will, thou, too, shall rise content Above thy days, thy cup shall. Overrun With very joyance; and the grateful tears Of happy motherhood shall lift thy soul Like some fair cloud above the sea of _ years. Thou, by thy loving precepts, shalt control Men and affairs, and thyself glorify Our noble mothers were not born to die.\" Happy he, With such a mother! Faith in womankind Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high Comes easy to him...Tennyson. Concerning Antique Furniture Dear Helen: Your letter from New York reached me early this morning. If it is true that you have really become afflicted with \"antique fever,\" it is quite certain you will never fully recover. However, be cheered by the knowledge that in spite of your affliction you will experience delights that other people, not so affected, will never know. You say, \"What shall I do?\" \"How can I learn about antiques?\" \"Please tell me where to begin.\" You are wise to start to furnish your house gradually, and work to a plan, as it takes a long time to make a home. The true home depends upon the heart and the spint of those trying to make it. Some people can make a home with scarcely a stick of furniture in it. I'm glad you have that gift. You are also wise to do something as a rest from your strenuous war work. Did you know that in England Walt Disney was considered to have made one of the most valuable contributions during the last war by producing his funny cartoons and furnishing relief from war strain? That is interesting, isn't it? I'm afraid I can't help you much, but since you have requested it, I will tell you how we went about furnishing our home. Naturally, gathering our furniture was tied up with our travels, but one does not necessarily have to travel to find beautiful furniture. There is beauty everywhere, even in the remotest villages if we but have eyes to discover it. My notes will be hodgepodge, as we traveled to so many places at such irregular intervals. Page 318 It would be impossible to go into detail about all \"furniture periods,\" as there are more than fifty since prehistoric man. Egypt, Persia, China, Greece, Rome, Florence, Venice, and France all influenced later designs of furniture in other countries. A lotus design or any other particular pattern means that the makers of the original furniture on which it appeared were reproducing objects of nature about them. A wide seat in a chair usually indicates that the clothing of that particular period required more space than clothing of other times. 'The study of furniture will give you a most stimulating review of the history of the world with an intimate look at the home life of its people. When I began to furnish our home, I searched through magazines and books for suggestions. 'Then I visited all the big shops on the avenues in New York. The quantity of furniture I found there brought nothing but confusion to my mind. One day I was sure I liked Chippendale best; the next day I knew I preferred Sheraton; the next day it seemed as if the Queen Anne style was the only thing that would make our house right. Finally at John Wanamaker's, one of the most famous shops in the world, I found beautiful new furniture and lovely old pieces on the same floor, arranged with all the artistry of the great decorators. I looked at the shiny new pieces and then at the old. The new ones were spick and span; the old ones were more mellow with a lustre to the wood, aged and tried like an old friend. The more T looked at old pieces the more J CONCERNING ANTIQUE FURNITURE liked them, so I then tried to eliminate the styles I liked least. From that time my search for furniture was confined to places where old furniture was to be found. Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue had charming antique shops. Stepping into them I left the hustling, bustling atmosphere of New York behind and was transported to quiet salons filled with old-world commodes, tables, chairs, mirrors, and porcelains. From there I went to decorators' shops and auctioneers' sales, always trying to find what I really liked. During this time, I met Gertrude Gheen, an interior decorator, who was an artist with refined and discriminating taste. She was a great lover of homes, and thought all homes should be beautiful, as children were entitled to be brought up in beautiful surroundings. By this she did not mean expensive sutrroundings, but those which' conformed to the test of true beauty, simplicity, and a grace in line and form, which distinguishes it from the commonplace. Miss Gheen opened my eyes to the beauties of various styles of furniture. She also showed me pictures of lovely homes she had decorated. Looking at these pictures, I became aware that the rooms were not always done in matched sets, that the comfort and convenience of the people had been considered first, and the furniture suited to that purpose. Sometimes a lovely piece from one period was combined with other furniture of harmonizing styles. I realized that no one need be a slave of fashion. Gradually as I continued to observe and study the various periods, 319 The Sheraton clock has ticked for more than one hundred years. It now stands on a handmade Spanish rug, flanked by a walnut chair of a harmonizing period, and a walnut flower stand over which hangs an Italian mirror of the Renaissance influence. I found myself turning more and more to the period of Louis XVI, which held so much grace and charm without being pompous. My second choice was Sheraton because of the 'wonderful proportions used in his designs and the perfection of his structure. Sheraton, by the way, is credited with having made the first twin beds, and roll-top desk. He was also the first to make secret compartments in secretaries, desks, cabinets, and sideboards. My _ third choice was Colonial, as it is so homelike and refined. Fortunately, my husband liked the same styles, and told me to go ahead and choose the furniture for our apartment. Our living room was difficult to arrange. It was long and somewhat narrow, finishing off in a triangular end on Riverside Drive, overlooking the Hudson. The west wall was the long wall, so Miss Gheen suggested 320 The carved mahogany posts of the Sheraton bed are very effective against the chintz draperies. The side tables are also mahogany. 'The lamps are made from old bronze ums. The filet lace spread has been used on this bed for twenty-five years. For the center a long walnut Louis XVI sofa, which we found in a cabinetmaker's shop downtown. Then we found a pair of small mahogany two-shelf bookcases with white marble tops finished with a decorative brass gallery about one inch high. In addition a love seat, a kidney-shaped table, and a pair of carved bergere chairs, similar in feeling to the sofa, which we secured after considerable searching, made a good foundation for the room. Just at this time we were invited to take a motor trip with friends through New England. Such a trip is one of the most delightful in the world, up through Boston, visiting all the historic spots. The dignified New England houses reminded us of what the Puritans had done. The magnificent trees made us feel as if we had no need for houses. Maples, chestnuts, elms, and beeches arched over the highway in the villages andtowns, and covered the hills out in the country in the distance. And yet when night came, with its crisp autumn air, the sheltering roof of the inn was appreciated and the crackling logs in the fireplace drew our thoughts toward home. The inns were usually furnished with Early American or Colonial furniture. 'The walls were often of fine boards with little or no decoration. The windows were curtained with cretonnes and fish nets. Interesting old Bible boxes and pewter picces gave the atmosphere of olden days. The floors were made of wide pine boards often covered with hooked rugs. Sitting comfortably in these inns we could get the effect of the furniture and were able to make up our minds as to whether or not we liked it. As we drove to the various towns, we became very fond of it. We stopped to shop in the quaint stores. Our business soon took us to London. There we were introduced into many pleasant English homes. We shopped in Picadilly Circus where everything was so different from the skyscrapers of New York. Old things were on every side of us, offices, shops, and churches. The people were cheery and industrious, going about their business in fog and cold and acting as if it were a pleasant summer day. It was exciting to wander about in the streets, thinking of the history of the great city. We visited St. Paul's Cathedral which was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren after the great fire in London. He was a great lover of furniture as well as an architect and did much to make living conditions better for the CONCERNING ANTIQUE FURNITURE 321 A Louis XVI commode is the center of attraction in this group, although the painting, bergere chair (at right) and occasional chair (at left) all have appeal. People generally. By this time we had decided to use furniture in the Sheraton style for our bedroom and other English pieces in' the dining room. One day while shopping in a little side street, we found a shop which had a grandfather's clock which had been made by Thomas Fletcher of Leeds. The dealer also had a Sheraton four poster bed with a canopy which we liked very much. Both pieces were accepted by the custom officials as being over 100 years old so they could enter the United States duty free as works of art. We bought the pieces and asked to have them sent to New York. It was interesting to watch the dealer pack them. First, he took off the pendulum of the clock, then lifted off the old iron weights that worked the hands of the clock and the striker. Next his men wrapped the case in paper and heavy packing straw and crated it, with the weights and pendulum also carefully wrapped. Then the men unhooked the draperies from the bed, unscrewed the canopy, and laid them in a neat pile, lifted off the box springs and mattress (which we did not buy), unscrewed the beautiful mahogany front posts carved in a laurelleaf pattern, and unbolted the heavy back posts-and backboard. The carved posts were wrapped like the clock, then were crated with all the other -pieces. Both clock and bed went down without complaint, and undismayed by the long journey to a strange land seemed to say: \"Cheerio, old dears, we'll. See you in New York.\", We went to Paris in April. The 322 The inlaid walnut dressing table is lighted by old-fashioned china lamps made from a pair of vases. The mirrors on the wall are green Venetian glass with etched figures. Sycamores were just putting forth their pale green leaves; there was sunshine and rain; and the whole world seemed enchanted. Paris was a happy place in those days. The poilus were back from the war and nothing else mattered. The museums were open and afforded us endless delight. The shops too were among the most beautiful we had ever seen. Along the boulevards near the opera house was displayed furniture of nearly all French types; but we still preferred Louis XVI for its quiet grace. 'There were several pieces that suited us exactly, so we purchased them. One was a simple commode beautifully inlaid with various designs, completed by a marble top. Another was an attractive mirror mounted in a carved and painted wooden frame, which looked lovely with a pair of brass candelabra decorated with rock-crystal flowers. Another piece that we found was a little inlaid walnut dressing table, with folding leaves on each side of a small attached mirror. It had to be reconditioned. The dealer agreed to do this before we bought it. It was astonishing what a miracle he worked with a little glue, fine sandpaper, wood filler, stain, and furniture polish. This little table was shipped to New York with the rest of the things and has since traveled thousands of miles. It now reposes quietly in my room still doing its duty. Modern furniture makers say it's \"\"Goodbye, Mr. Chippendale,\" but I cannot agree. Somehow there grows up an irreplaceable affection and respect for an antique that has weathered the buffetings of family life for fifty years Or more. Before you begin your search for furniture, check over everything at your mother's, your grandmother's and your uncles' and aunts'. Often they have lovely old pieces that they have finished with. One of my most treasured possessions is a small rectangular mirror in a lustre plaster frame. It crossed the plains with my grandmother nearly a hundred years ago and although somewhat mottled still gives back our reflections today. I prize also the rag rugs made twentyfive years ago by the Relief Society of which my mother was president. Used and washed these many years, they have taken on the soft colorings of great paintings and are still giving remarkable service as did the loving hands that made them.

So far, Russia is the only country in the world where women have full equality with men. In America there are still more than a thousand common law discriminations against women.

N the worst days of the London raids, Myra Hess, humanitarian and noted pianist, organized lunchtime concerts for workers in the National Gallery.

And it shall come, to pass, that inasmuch as they are faithful, and exercise faith in me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together. And it shall come to pass that they shall go forth into the regions round about, and preach repentance unto the people. THE 113th annual conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was held on April 4, 5, and 6, 1943. Once again, as at the two previous conferences because of the war, attendance was restricted to men holding certain callings in the Church, including some who formerly held them. Latter-day Saint soldiers holding the Melchizedek Priesthood who were free to attend were also invited to be present at the sessions, two of which were held on Sunday, three on Monday, and the final one on Tuesday morning. At the Sunday morning session, in addition to the usual Sunday morning Tabernacle Choir broadcast, the Church of the Air Address was delivered by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith of the Council of the Twelve on the subject, \"Blessed is the Nation Whose God is the Lord.\" The hearts of all those present in the tabernacle as well as the thousands of listeners over radio station KSL were touched and made to rejoice by the moving and beautiful statement of President Grant which was read by President David O. McKay at the opening of the conference sessions, Excerpts from this sermon Page 324 Doctrine and Covenants, Section 44. And those made by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. And President David O.- McKay are printed in this issue of the Magazine in the article by Elder Bryant S. Hinckley. 'The first and last sessions of the conference were broadcast over radio station KSL. Inspiring addresses were delivered and counsel given which will be heeded by all true Latter-day Saints. Church members were urged to obey the commandments of the Lord, to live lives of purity, to be loyal to Church leadership, and to render unselfish service to one another. As at the conference last October, saints residing in Salt Lake City opened their homes to house the conference brethren visitors. 'This condition was reminiscent of earlier days in the valley, when conference visitors were welcomed into Salt Lake homes and their visits were eagerly anticipated for many months. Such hospitality tends to strengthen the bond of fellowship in the Church. Conferences have ever been an integral part of Church procedure. On June 9, 1830, little more than two months after the Church was organized, the first conference as an organized Church was held at Fayette, New York. MAY 1943 No. 5 EDITORIAL The Prophet Joseph wrote of this conference: Our members were about thirty, besides whom many assembled with us who were either believers or anxious to learn.... Much exhortation and instruction was given, and the Holy Ghost was poured out upon us in a miraculous manner.... Such scenes as these were calculated to inspire our hearts with joy unspeakable, and fill us with awe and reverence for that Almighty Being, by whose grace we had been called to be instrumental in bringing about, for the children of men, the enjoyment of such glorious blessings that were now at this time poured out upon us. From that June day of 1830 until the present, conferences of the Church have been held, usually open to the general membership but at times restricted to the Priesthood. A review of the places where conferences have been held would recall 325 the scenes made memorable in Church history. As at the first,. So at the 113th conference, \"glorious blessings were now at this time poured out upon us.\" Present at the last conference were the most powerful men now living upon the earth. At the head sat the Prophet of the Lord who holds the keys to powers pertaining to this earth and the heavens. When all earthly powers and principalities will have passed away, the power of the Priesthood will remain throughout the eternities. Church' members have ever rejoiced at the privilege of attending general conferences and longingly look forward to the day when conditions will once more permit general gatherings of the saints at general conferences, there to be fed the bread of lifeM. C. S. = Memorial Semple to GYefferson GREAT marble shrine to Thomas Jefferson was dedicated by President Roosevelt on April 13, 1943, the 200th anniversary of the birth of Jefferson. The memorial is situated on the south bank of the Tidal Basin in Washington, D. C. It is fitting that at this time the freedom-loving patriot, Thomas Jefferson, should be honoredThomas Jefferson who wrote in 1800, \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" Jefferson was one of the great modern liberals; he was the first American statesman to make education by the State a fundamental article of democratic faith; he wrote the first statute of religious freedom; he refused to be elected as president for the third time although requested by the legislatures of five States to be a candidate, and thus helped to establish a precedent which he believed to be of great importance under a democratic government; and he was the writer of the immortal Declaration of Independence. Abraham Lincoln said, \"The principles of Jefferson are the axioms of a free Society.\" \"The range of his interestsin geography, geology, botany, zoology, ethnology, agriculture, plantation, medicine and surgery, mathematics, 326 aeronautics, invention, government, education [music], languages and literature, religionis astounding.\" He compiled from the New Testament a book of Jesus' teachings known as Jefferson's Bible. He never used tobacco, never gambled, never played cards, nor was party to a personal quarrel. He was only truly happy in the country and was buried on his country estateMonticello, in Virginia, where he lies under a plain stone monument for which he chose the epitaph: \"Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of the American Independ ence, of the statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and father of the University of Virginia.\" The memorial temple, 176 feet in height, is circular and built in a modified form of the Roman Pantheon, with twenty-six [onic columns topped by a white dome. A nineteenfoot plaster statue of Jefferson to be cast in bronze after the war, stands in the interior between two American flags. 'The memorial completes the fourth point of a cross formed by the Capitol, White House, and Lincoln Memorial, with the Washington Monument in the center and the axis formed by the Mall. <~f Agnes Mm Bolto Appointed to Relief Society General Board PPOINTMENT by the First Presidency of Agnes M. Bolto as a member of the Relief Society General Board was announced Wednesday, May 5, 1943, by President Amy Brown Lyman. At the time of her appointment to the General Board, Mrs. Bolto was president of the Granite Stake Relief Society. Her testimony of the Gospel, her long years of excellent service in Relief Society together with her native endowments and specialized training, will qualify her for her new position as a member of the General Board. Her many friends will be pleased to learn of this appointment, and her new associates on the General Board welcome her as a valued fellow Board member. A short biographical sketch of Mrs. Bolto will appear in the June issue of the Magazine. A FREE PEOPLE Rose Adeana Openshaw Oh may that span and scope be reached Where captives cease to be! Oh may we conquer weakness and Indeed be people free! VYlotesd 10 THE FIELD Ussiting Seaching HE month of May concludes the 1942-43 Relief Society educational season. During the four summer months, June through September, no regular classwork is conducted, but the monthly work-andbusiness meeting and monthly visits by the visiting teachers should be continued as usual. As was indicated at the Relief Society general conference in October 1940, and included in Blue Bulletin No. 26, June 24, 1942, arrangements may be made for each visiting teacher to have one month free during the summer, if desired, by using substitute teachers or by having teachers go singly one or two months, as necessary. During the summer, visiting teachers may visit without discussing a uniform topic, or may take into the homes any special messages provided by the stake or ward. Where the stake or ward has no special message to present, visiting teachers desiring subjects suitable for discussion in the home are referred to TheSuch articles as the following might appropriately be used: \"The Promise of the Gospel in Helping Us To Meet Present-Day Crises,\" President David O. McKay, March 1942, page 162; \"Family Prayer,\" Ray R. McKay, April 1942, page 254; \"Preserving Our Homes In Wartime,\" Mark K. Allen, July 1942, page 453; \"Mental Health Through Recreation,\" Mark K. Allen, November 1942, page 770; \"Brotherhood,\" Elder Harold B. Lee, February 1943, page 84; \"Radio Address,\" President Amy Brown Lyman, April 1943, page 236. Visits of visiting teachers should be friendly and short, and timed as opportunely for the women in the home as possible. Ifa woman is very busy, it is recommended that visiting teachers merely inquire as to the well-being of the family, extend an invitation to Relief Society meetings or other functions to be held during the month, deliver very briefly any necessary message, and then leave, stating that they will spend more time on their next visit when she may not be so busy. Visiting teachers are cautioned about repeating startling statements that cannot be verified, or discussing sensational subjects based on rumor. All topics discussed in the home should be based on authentic information, and should be helpful and encouraging. This not only makes the visit more profitable, but makes the visiting teachers more welcome in the home. The recommendations of the General Board regarding visiting teaching requiring automotive transportation, issued early in 1942 and effective during the period while there is limitation of automotive travel, are repeated here: 1. That visiting teaching be continued as usual where districts are within walking distance; 2. That where districts are scattered such districts be sub-divided, wherever practicable to do so, so that a smaller number of families may be visited by perhaps only one visiting teacher who lives in the neighborPage 327 328 hood and is within walking distance of the families in such smaller districts; 3. That where distances make it impracticable for visits to be made, the unvisited members take their contributions to the regular Relief Society meetings; 4. That those stakes which print leaflets for visiting teachers to distribute in the homes might send such leaflets by mail to unvisited families, or that such families might be called by telephone where this service is available, but that such communications should: not be counted as actual visits. Directions for keeping track of communications which are made in lieu of regular visits are given in the instructions in the back of the new visiting teachers' report books, under the heading '\"\"Communications in Lieu of Visits.\" One of the important duties of visiting teachers is to acquaint Latterday Saint women with the Relief Society program and to encourage participation in Relief Society activities. This is particularly important this year in areas where defense and war work have caused an influx of workers into the community, many of whom are Latter-day Saints and need to be brought actively into the work of the Society. Recent surveys have been made under the direction of ward bishops to identify new families living in their respective wards. 'The General Board recommends that Relief Society officers cooperate fully with their bishops in identifying and welcoming the Salvage VERY woman is anxious to do all in her power to help win the war and bring about peace. One effective way in which women may contribute to the war effort is to salvage materials that are so critically neededhousehold fats, tin cans and newcomers and in enlisting them as active members. Relief Society presidents are urged to procure from their bishops the names of new Latter-day Saint families to be added to the regular visiting-teacher list. When visiting these new families, special effort should be made to acquaint them with various Relief Society and other ward activities and to make them feel welcome. It is also suggested that visiting teachers notify the ward president, who in turn would notify the bishop, of any new Latter-day Saint families coming to their attention when making their regular visits. 'The opportunity Relief Society has for contacting the wives in the new households in every ward constitutes one of the most important points of beginning in the entire Church program in the interest of new families moving into various communities because of defense work.; Relief Society visiting teachers hold an important position in the Relief Society organization. The effectiveness of their work is dependent upon their understanding of their duties and responsibilities, and the spirit and diligence with which they meet these responsibilities. 'The General Board sincerely appreciates the splendid efforts of Relief Society visiting teachers. Program metals of any kind, silk and nylon hose, unusable clean cloth of all kinds, fur, and old and broken phonograph records. Depots have been arranged at stores for collection of fats, hosiery, and phonograph records. Local sal- NOTES TO THE FIELD vage committees arrange for periodic collection of other items. A small payment is made for fats and phonograph records which are turned in. It is suggested that some local Relief Societies may wish to handle collection of old or broken phonograph records from their members or others in the community, as a means of adding funds to their treasury while at the same time making available for use the valuable shellac for which the records are salvaged. ~ Information as to the collection of these various items may be _ obtained 329 from your local salvage committee. The demand for these materials is becoming greater each day the war goes on, and to meet the demand the aid of every individual on the home front is solicited. The Relief Society desires its members throughout the United States to cooperate fully with their respective salvage committees by announcing in Relief Society meetings the collections which are conducted from time to time by their local salvage committees, and by individually supporting the various salvage collections as they are conducted. Summer Program of Primary Association HE Relief Society General Board commends the Primary Association upon the splendid program it is conducting for children, particularly during the summer months when children are not in school and have time on their hands, and when they are working in fields and orchards and need the relaxation that comes from directed play or other activities. 'The program for the current summer quarter features profitable activities of many types, each ward being allowed to select the acPamphlet Available, tivies best suited to its needs. Children as well as adults are affected by war conditions. During war periods it is particularly important that they be given opportunity to participate in interesting, profitable, well-directed activities such as the Primary Association provides. The General Board. Recommends that Relief Society women wholeheartedly support the Primary program, and that they use their influence to have children attend regularly. 'How FRO) Vin on the Home Front ' HE General Board has on hand, T through arrangements made by the National Council of Women, a quantity of pamphlets entitled \"How to Win on the Home Front,\" issued in 1942 by the Public Affairs Committee, Incorporated. The pamphlet contains valuable information for the homemaker during wartime on such important subjects as: Scarcity, Higher Prices, Poorer Quality; The Rules of WarRationing, Quality and Standards, Credit Control, Taxes and War Bonds; Home Front StrategyA Plan of Action, Budgeting for Health, Stretching the 330 Food Dollar, Clothing and Miscellaneous Items, Housing Upkeep, and Going Places and Doing Things. Relief Societies desiring to do so may use this pamphlet as the basis for discussions in summer work-and-business meetings. The information contained in this pamphlet has been obtained largely from the publications of the Bureau of Home Economics of the Department of Agriculture, the Consumers' Guide, and Consumer Tips of the Consumers' Counsel of the Department of Agriculture, and official releases of the Office of Price Administration. Information on taxes and savings came from the United States Treasury. Due to the necessity of changes in rationing and the government price control program, some of the information on these subjects is not now current. Nevertheless, the pamphlet contains much valuable information. Although first made available at ten cents each, a limited supply of these pamphlets has been made available to Relief Society without charge. As long as the supply lasts, the General Board will meet requests for copies from Relief Society officers or members. Address requests to the General Board of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City, Utah. Potitions on Informative Labeling N Blue Bulletin No. 29, issued December 29, 1942, the General Board suggested that all Relief Societies in the United States cooperate with the National Council of Women in petitioning the Office of Price Administration to require that goods bear informative labels clearly stating what an article is, of what it is made, what service it will give, and how it should be cared for. Signed petitions were to be sent to the National Council. The Relief Society is highly commended for its efforts in this important matter in a letter recently received by the General Board from Charlotte Payne, Executive Secretary of the National Council. The following quotations are from Miss Payne's letter: You should have had a dozen letters in the past month because each mail has brought such enthusiastic response to the request for signatures on the petitions that we just beam at the very mention ofthe Relief Society! I think that a fair estimate of the number of signatures which we have had from your wards would be about 9,000 covering 33 states with almost 5,000 from Utah alone. We cannot tell you how proud and pleased we are with this evidence of your interest and cooperation. You know that we plan to present the petitions to Mr. Prentiss Brown. Meanwhile, our efforts along this line have already produced results. The recent stocking regulation is the first one in which informative labeling is a part of the requirement. Miss Payne further states that when a meeting is arranged with Mr. Brown, a Relief Society representative will accompany the group. \"This,\" she states, \"seems only fair since Relief Society has taken so active a part.\" Informative Labeling of Hosiery This article, obtained from Justin C. Stewart, is of special interest to Relief Society women since it deals with the regulation on stockingsthe first regulation of goods in which informative labeling is a part of the requirement. Relief Society women, in cooperation with the National Council of Women, recently petitioned the Office of Price Administration to require that goods bear informative labels. HE new OPA \"dollars and cents\" ceiling price regulation for rayon hose, effective April 15, reduces the amount American women wil] have to pay for their stockings from 5 to 40 cents per pair. The total amount women will save on their hosiery purchases during 1943 is about 15 per cent and will amount to an estimated 50 million dollars on their hosiery bill in a single year. A feature of the new regulation of particular interest to Relief Society members and others familiar with grades and standards for consumer goods is the provision which requires manufacturers to make their hose according to grade specifications and to label the hose accordingly if they wish to receive the maximum price. Grade \"A\" hosiery will contain features designed to lengthen the life and improve service, such as reinforcements in the foot and top and a minimum number of inches of stitches in the leg to prevent \"skimpy' construction. All stockings which fail to meet the OPA standards for Grade \"A\" will be classified and must be labeled as Grade \"B,\" irregulars, seconds, or thirds, and will be sold at proportionately lower prices. The ceiling prices vary from 12 cents for the cheapest construction of seamless \"thirds\" to as high as $1.43 for the most expensive continuous filament full-fashioned rayon. After the present stocks of hose in the hands of merchants are exhausted, stockings will appear on merchants' shelves with the grade labels marked on the hose at the factory. The new regulation recognizes that the methods of operation and wholesale costs vary between stores, and that, consequently, the operating costs are different. Accordingly, two ceiling prices are established for each hose, depending on the \"class\" of store in which the sale is made. Following are typical ceiling prices: 51 gauge full-fashioned ceiling price either 3 cents or $1.05 45 gauge full-fashioned ceiling price either 81 cents or 92 cents 42 gauge full-fashioned ceiling price either 75 cents or 84 cents 340 Needle Bare-leg ceiling price either 47 cents or 53 cents In announcing the price ceilings, OPA has emphasized that faullfashioned hosiery is still in its infancy and that rayon as material for fullfashioned hose was largely experimental as recently as 1941. Studies are continuing to determine if the standards of rayon hose can be further improved and prices will be adjusted either upward or downward whenever experience proves this to be necessary. In establishing the standards and prices, OPA held extensive meetings with representatives of the hosiery industry, labor, retailers, consumer groups, and technical experts of the OPA and War Production Board as well as other standardization agencies in order to secure the best advice available in the country. Page 33] Care of Children In Wartime HE General Board, aware of the many problems confronting mothers today, particularly that of safeguarding children, publishes the following letter from Katharine F. Lenroot, Chief, Children's Bureau, U. S. Department of Labor. We, along with other churches, law-enforcement agencies, and public and private welfare agencies, are greatly concerned over the alarming increase of juvenile delinquency throughout the country. We are particularly concerned because many L. D. S. Youths are among the juvenile offenders. Church auxiliary organizations have announced special programs designed to interest our children and youth and profitably direct their activities. 'The Primary Association will conduct an excellent summer program, including both work and play activities. 'The Y. W. M. LA. Plans to conduct a summer program for 20,000 BeeHive girls, directed toward effective war service work. These programs Dear Mothers and Fathers: merit the full support of mothers or the Church. However, the task of properly caring for and directing children cannot be left to Church auxiliaries; it devolves primarily upon parents. 'The General Board urges mothers throughout the Church to place every possible safeguard about their children. An evil influence is abroad which threatens even the best homes. Social problems, greatly aggravated by the war, demand vigilance on the part of mothers. There is no substitute for mothers in the home, and they should not leave the home to earn money unless real necessity demands it and unless proper provision is made for children while the mother is away. Parents should also make sure that both boys and girls who leave home to take employment are satisfactorily located in homes with interested relatives or other responsible adults, where they may be properly supervised. May 1, 1943 Have you been wondering whether you are doing everything you can for your children during this war period?... If ever children needed mothering and fathering, they need it now.... Your Johnny and Jane know lots of things are different at home today. There will be more changes tomorrow. Both for you and for them many of these changes are hard to take. But with you there, throwing your confidence and pluck and affection around Johnny and Jane, they'll not be hurt. These are the foods your children grow on, just as much as the bread they eat. They need such food every A child's spirit can be undernourished as well as his body. Day of their growing lives. Your faith, and your courage, and your love are Grade A foods for your child's spirit. There are no others as good. Of course it takes time to give children that quality of care. Just as you willingly give the time it taks to provide the carrots, milk, and other Page 332 CHILDREN IN WARTIME 333 foods you give your child, you'll be glad later for the extra time you spend now in giving him affectionate guidance. Behind many a youngster in trouble is a parent overburdened with work, who thought he or she was too busy for children. Because the job you are doing is so tremendously vital to the Nation, a Children's Bureau Commission on Children in Wartime is helping our Bureau to help you in every way we can. Millions of you parents, during war, will have no choice but to yield to someone else some part of the place you have in your children's lives. Some fathers must go to war. Some mothers must leave home to work. To those of you who must, the doctors say: Keep the channels of affection and the lines of communication to your children as wide open as you can. If Dad must be away from home altogether, try to put your children in touch with some other male relative who will keep an affectionate eye on your charges. Group activities, directed by men in the neighborhood or in school or church, will help your young ones without changing their loyalty and affection for their fathers. And when Dad leaves be sure that, if possible, the letters keep coming back home. Fathers who are at home can help mightily, too, if they will take time to spread their companionship to neighbors' children who must wait until war is over to welcome home their own fathers. And you, Mother. If you are one of the millions of mothers who do your war job of caring for your children at home, maybe you can give some of yourself to the children of other mothers, too. Perhaps you can help at the baby clinic, or with school lunches, or on playgrounds.... If you are a mother who must earn money away from home, get the best possible substitutes you can for the care you would otherwise provide. If you can't find or can't afford someone to come into your home, use every help your community provides for children. If you don't know what they are, yout local defense council will be glad to give you suggestions. Last but not least, especially watch over your older boys and girls, who are having to grow up so fast. 'They may need to be guarded against overtaxing their strength. They may want your aid in finding ways of helping that will make them feel important in your grownup world. Above all, they deserve the kind of advice that understanding friends give to each other. You see how big a job you fathers and mothers have in your hands right now. It's a war job of the highest priority rating. There are no uniforms to wear to distinguish this public service. No medals will come to you if you do well. But the bearing and grace of your child as he lives his days bravely and with fine spirit will be the match of any medal. Sincerely yours, Katharine F. Lenroot, Chief, Children's Bureau, U. S. Department of Labor Planned Strategy for the Garden Pests Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, The Deseret News FTER the spring planting has all been done and the garden has begun to put out fresh new growth, then trouble usually creeps in like the proverbial villain in the play, to try the heart and spirit of the home gardener. All during the hopeful spring planning and planting season the garden pests have lain in wait until some choice favorite plant would be spreading its beautiful green leaves, perhaps even showing a few promising buds. Only then do the exasperating insects attack like some vile thief in the night, and they often do great damage before the unsuspecting gardenmaker discovers their presence. Every home gardener must anticipate this annual invasion, for seldom do gardens escape being attacked by one or another of the common garden pests. 'There is no use. To wring one's hands and lament the matter, we must meet such a common emergency with a fighting spirit. We must be prepared with a planned program of defense by having modern spray equipment ready and waiting to drive the invaders out as soon as they appear. We must arm ourselves with the wherewithall for making a fighting stand, for preparedness and perseverance are two-thirds of the battle in fighting these troublemakers. Page 334 Most of these common garden pests come under one of three types: there are the chewing insects, the sucking kinds, and the fungous spores and other plant diseases. If you suddenly discover some plant is being eaten, either the foliage, buds, or tender stems, then you can be sure that you are entertaining one of the chewers (and these come in many fancy sizes, shapes, and forms). The cure for this type of pest is poison spread over the entire plant, foliage, buds, and stems, so that no matter where Mr. Bug next chooses to dine, he will find a dose sufficient to stop his career of crime. This can be applied by means of either a liquid spray or in powder form, spreading the powder with a dusting gun. Arsenate of lead is the chemical usually employed in most spray preparations for control of the chewers, although pyrethrum and Paris green are also used. The sucking insects present a different problem for they do not eat the foliage, but thrust a long proboscis or beak into the tender juicy new growth and suck out the very life blood of the plant, its sap, causing it to wither and often even die. The suckers are usually very small, the commonest being the plant aphis, stealthy creatures of great ingenuity who congregate on the underside of the leaves, the stems, and in the crevices. These mild-appearing but PLANNED STRATEGY FOR THE GARDEN PESTS murderous small insects increase at such an alarming rate that unless something is done to control them, they often completely ruin an entire year's crop. But the poison spray which is so effective against the chewing insects is useless in fighting this type. Instead of poisoning them, we must apply a product which will kill them by suffocating them with poison fumes. Nicotine is the usual cure, and it too is available in either liquid or powder form and under many different trade names. The fungous diseases require dusting with sulphur or copper to control bacteria or fungous growth such as mildew, the plant disease which so often attacks roses, and other plants, spreading its gray powdery mass over foliage and stems, causing disfigurement. Fortunately for the home gardener, there are now several preparations which contain all three of these different types of insecticides so that one can use one spray for the control of all garden pests. 'This is the most practical method for the amateur, and the one which gives best results. Reliable nurserymen can supply such all-purpose sprays that will do the trick if they are used early in the season, and even before the pests have made their appearance. It is the same old story of an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure. If a spraying or dusting program is carried out at regular intervals during the year, it is quite possible to keep any garden free from insect damage. But the gardener must apply the remedy thoroughly and early, followed by other applications, especially in the case of the sucking types. 335 The dusting gun is most popular with many gardeners because this is so easily used, and this should be equipped with a long extension rod so that the dust may be applied from the ground upward to reach the underside as well as the upper leaves. The dust spreads out in a cloud, reaching more surface than the liquid spray. Such a dusting gun can be purchased for the sum of one dollar. Here are a few rules to help the gardener to have a pest-free garden: 1. Keep the garden well raked and tidy; many pests live and hide underneath old trash, boards, or wood left lying about. 2. Purchase rust-proof and _ wilt-proof seeds of many annuals and vegetables as offered in catalogues. 3. Do not crowd the plantings, but allow plenty of air between plants. 4. Rotate the different crops each season; certain pests attack only certain crops, and by moving crops about the diseases. Or insects that live over in the soil will be avoided.. Do not water roses in late afternoon or night, this encourages mildew. 6. Keep out of the garden when plants are wet, for mildew and other fungi will cling to clothing and be spread when wet. 7. Cultivate the surface regularly, this destroys many pests. Wi HERE are a few other common \"plant and garden pests which require other methods, the commonest being the grasshopper which has been so troublesome of recent years. This pest is best handled by spreading a poisoned bait, a new product called Bug-Geta being easily used to fight not only grasshoppers, but cutworms, sowbugsthe small flat creeper which rolls itself up into a round ball when disturbedsnails, slugs, and weevils. 336 The lover of gladioli should also be well prepared with a spray to use in the control of thrips, the insect which causes such havoc in this beautiful flower. One can do much to fight this pest by soaking the bulbs for eight to ten hours in a solution of one quart warm water to one teaspoonful of lysol, just before planting. But in addition, one must spray with a solution made by mixing one heaping tablespoon of Paris green, two pounds of brown sugar or any sweet syrup, and three gallons of water. 'This spray should be used as soon as the leaves are about six inches high, and followed by two other sprayings a week apart. This will md any planting of this pest which so often ruins whole crops of flowers. Does all this seem a melancholy and distasteful business to one who starts out. To make beauty, and to grow pleasant and delicious vegetables? We admit that it is not the most enjoyable of the many garden jobs, but our complex modern life has brought pests from countries far and wide into our gardens, and only by taking a sensible attitude and by equipping ourselves to cope with them can we hope to escape pest troubles. Let us cheerfully include these few simple tasks as a regular part of successful gardening, just as weeding and watering are a necessary part of its upkeep. We can promise that the gardener will be well repaid for such efforts, especially if she will begin the program of dusting or spraying early before the pests have established themselves. We can well apply that old axioman ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and the rewards are great.

Grant and President Amy Brown Lyman.\n\"At 5 p.m. we witnessed an impressive tree-planting ceremony. The tree, a beautiful blue spruce, had been donated and transported to us by a florist friend from Durango, Colorado, not a member of our Church. At 8 p.m. 150 persons, consisting of Relief Society members, their partners, and ten or twelve guests not of our Church, were seated around candle-lighted tables, decorated in blue and gold. Artistic handpainted booklets entitled 'Rays of Living Light' served as place cards at each plate, which beautifully portrayed the menu, program, and appropriate scriptural quotations.

Relief Society colors, blue and gold, were used in the decorations. The supper was served cafeteria style from a long table centered by the birthday cake which consisted of two layers each thirty inches by fifty inches with the Relief Society emblem in the center surrounded by candles. Also decorating the table was a large bouquet of carnations, one of which was presented to each member of the Relief Society. The people ate at small tables and the supper was bountiful and delightful.\nThe program which followed included songs by the Singing Mothers, led by Lillian Nielson, and an address by the ward Relief Society president, Mabel Jensen, honoring past Relief Society officers, and a patriotic talk by Marvis Fife. The play, \"Is It Possible?\" was staged in a very beautiful garden setting under direction of Dorothy Fife, with appropriate music played softly throughout by Alice Carlin. Six young ladies in old-fashioned costumes sang and danced \"Old Fashioned Garden,\" with Robert Fife as accompanist. The remainder of the evening was spent in dancing, and pieces of the birthday cake were served.\nSHE LET HER LIGHT SO SHINE 347\nSHE LET HER LIGHT SO SHINE\n(Continued from page 311)\nWhen the fourteenth candle was flaming, Amy Kathryn continued:\nThese are but a few of her outstanding contributions to the uplifting progress of her fellow men. And now the summation of the light that she has shed in her various fields of achievement entitles her to add a brilliancy to the Hall of Fame.\nWith this last statement, the little character, Amy Brown, came down the stage into the spotlight and lighted the candle representing the Hall of Fame. This candle was a large white one set in an old-fashioned candlestick made entirely of gorgeous fresh pastel-colored flowers.\nIn a clear steady voice filled with love, Amy Kathryn continued:\nShe is my grandmother and I should be modest, but she lighted my candle too, and I am grateful. Sonow dear grandmother, I return the light to you, the giver, that you may go on sharing it with others!\nAmy Kathryn then gracefully picked up the huge candle in its colorful, petal-fresh holder, and carrying it the full length of the ballroom she presented it to her grandmother at the honored guests' table. This impressive finale was greeted with great applause.\nMrs. Stewart took the scroll of honor to Mrs. Lyman that she, in turn, might add her name to the list of famous women. Mrs. Shepherd welcomed her into the Hall of Fame and pinned a service medallion over her heart.\nMrs. Lyman's reply was full of appreciation for the honor accorded her. She was particularly happy that it was the women of her own community who selected her for membership in their Hall of Fame."

Other women selected for the same honor were: Dr. Maud May Babcock, Judge Reva Beck Bosone, Mrs. W. F. Core, Mrs. Arthur E. Graham, Mrs. R. W. Fisher, and Mrs. Lula Greene Richards. The Council employed various means to acquaint the public with the wonderful contributions made by those they honored. Beginning March 11, 1943, a unique series of radio programs was presented. Each day for seven days, a fifteen-minute program was broadcast over radio station KSL which gave interesting glimpses into the lives of the new members of the Hall of Fame. The series was capably ditected by Louise Hill Howe of KSL. Priscilla L. Evans, member of the General Board, had charge of gathering the material to be presented PRESIDENT AMY BROWN LYMAN AND MASTER CANDLE SYMBOLIC OF ACHIEVEMENTS RECOGNIZED IN HER ELECTION TO THE HALL OF FAME for Mrs. Lyman. Mrs. Lyman's biographical sketch was given March 18, 1943. An interesting account of the achievements of our beloved President clearly indicated why she was selected for-this award. The evening of March 20, 1943, the Salt Lake City Council of Women further honored their selectees at a large public reception in the Junior Ballroom of the Hotel Utah. In the receiving line were Mrs. Ed F. Shepherd, president of the Council, Mrs. Emily S. Stewart, reception chairPage 309 310 man, Mrs. Grant Gregerson and Mrs. Junius Fisher, assistants to Mrs. Stewart, and the honored women. The reception lasted for one hour, during which hundreds of friends took advantage of the privilege to congratulate the guests of honor. Many state and civic officials were among those who called. President and Mrs. Heber J. Grant paid honor to the occasion by attending the reception, as did other Latter-day Saint Church officials. A large banquet in the Lafayette Ballroom followed. The reception. Approximately 300 dinner guests greeted the famous women as they entered and took their places at the speaker's table. A program followed the dinner. Mrs. Stewart welcomed those assembled. She introduced the program chairman, Mrs. Irma Felt Bitner, who outlined the events to follow. The introduction to the program was made by Council President Mrs. Ed F. Shepherd. She briefly and graciously outlined the outstanding characteristics of each of the seven elect ladies. At the completion of her talk, playlets or skits were presented from the stage in the ballrooom, depicting phases of interest from the lives of those honored. The General Board of the Relief Society took charge of the skits for President Amy Brown Lyman and Mrs. Lula Greene Richards, the first editor of the Woman's Exponent and an active participator in Relief Society endeavor. The literary committee of the General Board, under the chairmanship of Mrs. Rae B. Barker, arranged the skit for Mrs. Richards. Mary Grant Judd wrote and directed it, emphasizing her lit erary gifts, spirituality, and charm. Edith Smith Elliott was chairman of the committee to arrange the playlet narrating Mrs. Lyman's gifts and attainments. The skit, a collaboration by Mrs. Elliott, Mrs. Vilate Raile, and Mr. Francis Urry of KSL, was built around the following paragraph taken from Mrs. Lyman's autobiography, \"In Retrospect\": Our home, a one and one-half story adobe house, was lighted with kerosene lamps and candleslamps for downstairs and candles for upstairs. The candles were molded by my Mother's own hands. As we ascended the stairs each evening, a mark on the candle indicated how long we could study or visit or play before we retired. Can't we all picture little Amy Brown eager to crowd as much development as possible into the time that the flame of the candle could shed its warmth and light? The miniature drama opened with the stage very simply set. On the stage left front was a microphone. At the right front was a small oldfashioned table and armchair. On the table was a lighted candle in a candlestick. In the center at the back of the stage were some ragcarpeted stairs, and on each side of the stairs were tall seven-branch candelabra holding eighteen-inch white tapers.. After a brief introduction by the narrator, Helen Ann Young of KSL, the spotlight was thrown off the left of the stage. While a string trio played \"Lead Kindly Light,\" Amy Kathryn Lyman, a granddaughter of President Lyman, appeared carrying a large book representing her grandmother's autobiography. She was dressed in pale pink chiffon which emphasized the beauty of her blonde SHE LET HER LIGHT SO SHINE hair and fair skin. She stood before the microphone and said: \"Reading from the autobiography of my grandmother, Amy Brown Lyman, I came upon this paragraph.\" She then read the paragraph referred to above. While she read, Mrs. Lyman's daughter, Mrs. Margaret Lyman Schreiner, came onto the stage dressed as Mrs. Lyman's mother. She sat in the chair by the oldfashioned table. Four children came in next and gathered around Mother Brown who went through the motions of lighting the candle. In pantomime she explained the mark on the candle, kissed each child goodnight and sent them up the ragcarpeted stairs, and then went off the stage. Three of the children were Richard, John, and Gretchen Schreiner, grandchildren of President Lyman. The fourth, Shauna Stewart, played the part of little Amy Brown at about the age of twelve years. Following this episode, Amy Kathryn mused: The idea intrigued me. I visualized my grandmother as a little girl, in a gray linseywool dress, her dark hair combed smoothly from her face. In my mind I could see her eyes fastened on the mark her mother had made on the candle she carried, and I know she was hoping it would burn slowly that she might get as much reading done as possible. Again and again I thought of her letting a brother or a sister light a candle from hers, and of the uncountable times she has let others light theirs also. I thought of the dark corners into which she carried her lighted candle. Then suddenly I knew it was because she carried a \"candle,\" because she shared her \"light\" with thousands of others that she is a great and noble woman. In fancy through the years I seem to see her as she goes about lighting many 311 candles to increase the ever-glowing brilliance of the lightthe torch first placed in her hands by Deity and kindly parents. At this point, little Amy Brown appeared coming back down the stairs with a lighted candle in her hand and began to light the tapers in the tall candelabra, each representing the light that Mrs. Lyman has shared in different fields of progress. As each candle was lighted, Amy Kathryn recited the accomplishment which the candle represented: 1. As a homesteader she shed her light in the desert, helping to make it blossom as the rose. 2. She did volunteer service at Hull House with Jane Addams. 3. She shared her knowledge with others in the field of teaching. 4. Her home is a place of gentleness, culture, refinement, and hospitality. 5. As a legislator she used rare judgment. 6. She fosters fine arts in her family and community.: 7. She has programmed intelligently for the underprivileged at American Fork. 8. She served nine years as an officer in the National Council of Women. G. Grandmother was a delegate six times to the conventions of the International Council of Women. 10. A pioneer in social welfare, nationally and internationally. 11. She has given generously of her means, time, and talents in patriotic endeavor. 12. As a missionary in Europe she spread the light of Christianity. 13. Established the \"Amy Brown Lyman Loan Fund\" to help girls with their education at the Brigham Young University. 14. Crowning the activities of her life's work of service, she presides today over the National Woman's Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintsmembership 115,000 members.

            "content": "113th Annual Conference Elder Bryant S. Hinckley HERE is no other gathering in 'L'a world just like a general conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Laymen and leaders come from all the vast territory covered by the stakes of Zion. These conferences have a social and economic, as well as a spiritual value. The local leaders from wards and branches gather in Salt Lake City, the headquarters of the Church, for instruction, inspiration, and to transact the necessary business of the Church. They hear the annual reports, financial and otherwise, sustain with their vote the General Authorities of the Church, and go home refreshed in spirit and renewed in faith. These gatherings give solidarity to the whole body of the Church, unify and harmonize its plans and purposes, stimulate the faith of the members, and encourage the leaders to greater endeavor. Owing to the war, the attendance at the 113th annual conference was restricted to the Priesthood leaders and admission to the conference sessions was by card. The meetings were held on April 4th, sth, and 6th, in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. A new feature was the holding of regional conferences on the two Sundays following, at which representatives of the General Authorities were in attendance to carry over the spirit and message of the general conference. President Grant was present at all of the sessions of this conference except one. Yielding to the advice of his physician he did not speak, but dictated an address which was read by President David O. McKay. From the opening sentence, \"To the Latterday Saints all over the world, I send my love and greetings,\" to the final paragraph of this inspired message, the vast audience listened with rapt attention and were thrilled by what the venerable leader had to say. Among other things, the President said, \"My heart goes out in the deepest sympathy and in the most sincere and earnest prayer that I have ever offered for the comforting ifluence of the Lord to be given to the brethren and sisters who have sons in the war at the present time. I pray that Page 301 302 the Lord will bless each and every boy who has been called or who has gone into the service, and that He will help each of them to live in accordance with the principles of the Gospel, so that each may havea claim to the blessings of the Lord.... I pray that, so far as it accords with the providence of the Lord, each of them may be preserved from accident, sickness, and death, to return in due course to his loved ones. I pray God to help them to stand up under the terrible strain which they must meet. I appeal to the Lord to bring the war to an end at the earliest possible date. My heart goes out to all of you.... I want to thank the people for their prayers in my behalf. I have not been well now for a period of more than three years, and yet during all that time I have never suffered any pain. My days have been full of joy. I have seen the Church grow _.. As I have never seen it grow before.... Years ago I made a short speech that lasted a minute and a half to the effect that we were architects of our own lives, and that we and we alone are responsible for not making a success of life. What I said was as follows: 'If you want to know how to be saved, I can tell you; it is by keeping the commandments of God. No power on earth, no power beneath the earth, will ever prevent you or me or any Latter-day Saint from being saved, except ourselves. We are the architects of our own lives, not only of the lives here, but the lives to come in the eternity. We ourselves are able to perform every duty and obligation that God has required of men. No commandment was ever given to us but that God has given us the power to keep that commandment. If we fail, we, and we alone, are responsible for the failure, because God endows His servants from the President of the Church down to the humblest member, with all the ability, all the knowledge, all the power that is necessary, faithfully, diligently, and properly to discharge every duty and every obligation that rests upon them, and we, and we alone, will have to answer if we fail in this regard.' \" 'These words were uttered forty years ago. They were true then and they are true now. Continuing he said, \"I am grateful to our Heavenly Father for the faith and faithfulness of this great people, for their devotion to His service, for their effort and determination to live in accordance with His laws and commandments. I thank our Heavenly Father that He has given them the strength and courage to resist evils as well as they have been able to do so. I pray that He will bless the youth of the Church and give them strength to overcome temptation. I pray that He will bring into the heart of every boy, and of every girl a knowledge that cleanliness is next to godliness, that they must live clean both in mind and in body, that they will understand that the sin of unchastity is to the Lord next to the sin of murder. I pray that the Lord will give to the parents of the youth an understanding and appreciation of the dangers and temptations to which their children are subjected, that they may be led and guided to encourage their children, to direct them, to teach them how to live as the Lord would have them live. The Lord has said He would sift His people, and I pray that when that sifting 113th ANNUAL CONFERENCE comes no parent may have failed to do his duty, and no child shall have failed to obey the commandments of the Lord.\" RESIDENT J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Gave the concluding address of the Priesthood meeting Monday night. His manner was modest and impressive. His words clear, convincing, and authoritative, findin lodging in the minds of all who heard them. His appeal had a spiritual force and an effectiveness altogether uncommon. He pointed out the responsibility of the leaders of the Church with reference to the Latterday Saint boys in the armed service of the country. He began his remarks by asking how many had themselves served in the armed forces of the nation during the World War I then he asked who of those. Present had sons now serving in the army, and then he added those who had grandsons, and then those who had sons and grandsons subject to service in the war. Approximately half of the congregation of Priesthood officers in the Church were on their feet. This, he said, was an indication of the far reaching effects of the war. He told of the publications of literature for these service men in the form of a pocket edition of the Book of Mormon, a book on the principles of the Gospel, and a small Church Directory. \"Our young men in the armed forces will need all of our faith and prayers and all that they can get from these books to help them live righteously.\" He referred to the commandment, \"Honor thy father and thy mother\" and then stressed the responsibility of Latter-day Saints to care properly 303 for their families. \"\"The Church,\" he declared, \"is prepared, with your help and assistance, to take care of those who need such assistance, and if any of the Saints have cast their parents off see if you can not get them to take them back... If they need help in this let them go to the Bishops and get it in the right way.... If we assume the obligations which God has given to us, we will care for our own.... Do not be lulled to sleep by any... Slogan as that the State ' owes to every man a subsistence.\" President Clark gave a new definition for needy in the Church Welfare Program. He said the Church has always regarded those in need as those being without food or the necessities of life. 'Today there is a new group in need of help. This group includes any man or woman who, in this emergency, is in need of help to harvest his crops or to keep. His business going. He advocated this as a new approach for quorum activities and urged the men of the Priesthood to organize and take over this responsibility. He declared that marriage should be one of the holiest ordinances into which members of the Church can enter. He discouraged marriage by our young people with those who are not members of the Church for frequently such marriages end in tragedy. He said, \"Every consideration of faith, principles of right living, Church doctrine, and Church standards, requires that we should guard, as we would guard our lives, the chastity of our girls. There are all kinds of influences at work to break down these standards. I was told the other day that we have a new phrase, that young girls who 304 smoke and drink and may be doing other things talk about \"new Mormons\" as distinguished from the \"old Mormons.\" I wish to say to them that those who abandon the standards and principles of the Church are not Mormons at all,\" and, \"I urge you young women and girls to remember that in the schedule of crimes, unchastity comes next to murder. Do not subject yourselves to its penalty.\" He said the members of the Church are called upon now to sacrifice their sons but because they have to sacrifice their sons is no reason why they should sacrifice their daughters. President Clark, concluded with this impressive observation: \"What a tragic spectacle man is showing to his God today. We have rightly boasted for nearly a hundred years that in this, the Last Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, the Lord was pouring out His inspiration and His blessings upon all the world, unlocking to His children secrets that never were dreamed of by the ancients, giving them powers and dominions over the forces of nature, bringing under subjection almost the universe. Look at what the last century has given us in art, literature, science, discoveries, for our blessing and advancement. God gave all this to us to bless us. And then consider that now, in this terrible hour, every device, every invention, every discovery God gave us to bless us is being used to destroy one another in one of the most barbarous wars of all time. God will not hold guiltless those responsible for this holocaust.\" PRESIDENT David O. McKay's address was a clear and eloquent declaration of the ideals of Mormonism as they should be lived today by every Latter-day Saint. To the people of the nation and to the Latter-day Saints, President McKay voiced this vital admonition: \"While our sons, sweethearts, and husbands are offering their lives in defense of the God-given gift of Free Agency and for the right to live without the domination of tyranny, let us in the 'Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as citizens of our beloved country, use our influence to see that men and women of upright character, of unimpeachable honor are elected to office, that our homes are kept unpolluted and unbroken by infidelity, that children therein will be trained to keep the commandments of the Lord, 'to be honest, true, chaste, benevolent and virtuous, and to do good to all men.'\" He held the home as the second essential element in the building and perpetuity of a great people. He said, \"If, and when the time comes that parents shift to the State the responsibility of rearing their children, the stability of the Nation will be undermined, and its impairment and disintegration will have begun.\" He scored the increasing divorce rate in the United States as a threatening menace to this nation's greatness. Race suicide and tandem polygamous relationships made possible by lax divorce laws are enemies of ideal national life. The increase throughout the United States in the percentage of divorces is alarming. And _ this insidious evil is increasing in the Church. There are too many couples in the Church, who when trouble 113th ANNUAL CONFERENCE arises, seek solution in the divorce courts. In discussing the home as the most important factor in building a great nation, President McKay declared that the most vicious enemy to home life is immorality. 'This corroding evil\" he said, \"is just as demoralizing to the young man as to the young woman.\" More than thirty discourses were delivered at the conference, every one of which was permeated with hope, encouragement, and the spirit of eternal truth. There were fervent testimonies borne and many messages of real eloquence given that will enrich the literature of the Church. The contribution which religion should make to the home, to the nation, and to society were clearly and forcefully presented. 305 The Church of the Air Address on Sunday morning, April 4th, which was a part of the general conference was given by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, \"Blessed Is the Nation Whose God Is the Lord.\" Although the attendance at the conference was restricted to the Priesthood leadership, its spirit and influence will reach to the remotest corner and branch of the Church. Frequent reference was made to the Church Welfare Program. The annual report showed that the Relief Society had disbursed to the needy $371,442. This large sum does not represent a tithe of the contribution of this great and benevolent society to the welfare of the people of the Church."

            "content": "Teach Tithing In the Home. Presiding Bishop LeGrand Richards N the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood there is considerable attention given to the teaching of the law of tithing. Young men are taught that one-tenth of their increase belongs to the Lord. They are taught that this divine command from our Heavenly Father applies, with equal force, to each member of the Church, whether young or old. They are taught that income, not age, determines the obligation. Too frequently our youth grow up under the impression that the payment of tithing may, or even should be, deferred until maturity. Inquiry and observation reveal that in a great many cases Our young people become acquainted with the law of tithing for the first time in the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood or in the classes of the various auxiliary organizations of the Church. In such instances this means that they have never been taught tithing by their parents in the home. If they become acquainted with this law of the Lord, they must receive this information and training outside the parental home. This is not as the Lord would have it. The obligation for teaching young people rests first upon father and mother in the home. The quorums of the Priesthood and the auxiliary organizations of the Church serve as supplements and aids to the home, but in no way relieve parents of their responsibility to teach their children to obey the commandments of the Lord. Failure to teach our sons and daughters to pay an honest tithe brings them under the Lord's stinging indictment \"'... Ye have robbed me.\" Innocently they inquire, \"Wherein have we robbed thee?\" The reply, \"In tithes and offerings\" will prompt their plea of innocence but their guilt is none the less real. And all of this they suffer largely because parents failed them during the tender and impressionable years of youth. It is a safe conclusion that parents generally fail to teach their children the law of tithing because they themselves have not been obedient thereto. A father or a mother who pays an honest tithe is always proud to have sons and daughters know that this obligation has been discharged, and to have them do likewise. But the parent who pays little or no attention to this commandment frequently seeks to justify his disobedience by attempting to discredit the validity of this law of the Lord. He may even go so far as to discourage his children's obedience in order that he may experience the sinful comfort of companionship in disobedience. From various sections of the Church there are numerous examples coming to light which attest the effectiveness of the teachings of the Aaronic Priesthood quorums and other Church organizations relative to the law of tithing. Young men and young women whose parents have never paid tithing are faithful in returning one-tenth to the Lord. Still other parents have become converted to the payment of tithing when their sons and daughters have Page 307 308 set the example in th taithful dis- 'charge 'of 'this 'obligation. This is commendable but it does not justify the shift of this responsibility from the parental home to the Church organizations. It may some day be embarrassing for children to be obliged to give to the Church, instead of their parents, the credit for teaching them the law of tithing. It will be still more embarrassing when our Heavenly Father inquires of parents as to why they neglected this parental duty. Many children today, some young and some now grown to maturity, are being denied the great blessings attendant upon the payment of tithing because their parents did not teach them while in the home to obey this law. It is in this way that the Lord visits \"... The iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation....\" Surely, no parent can feel happy about his neglect when it means that his children are not entitled to the blessings they otherwise would have received had they been taught to pay an honest tithe. The ideal situation is for our young people to be properly taught and trained in the home to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, and then receive the supplementary teachings in the Priesthood quorums | and the auxiliary organizations of the Church. The home and the Church working unitedly together will accomplish a marvelous work and perform a. Noble mission in the training of the youth of Zion. One instance of this cooperation between the home and the Church reveals that sixty-six young men residing in two wards in the same stake, came up through the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood where the law of tithing received its proper emphasis, and during their first year as ordained elders paid an average tithe of $77.12 each. These young men had faithfully paid their tithing during the years they served as deacons, teachers, and priests, with the result that when they were ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood the teachings of the home and the Church together had become an integral part of their lives. This is as the Lord would have it. This is the way we may bind Him to His promised blessings which He anxiously waits to pour out upon the faithful everywhere. May is here! The air is fresh and sunny; And the miser-bees are busy Hoarding golden honey. Thomas Bailey Aldrich."

Parmley The Counselors to Mrs. Hinckley in General Presidency of Primary MAY GREEN HINCKLEY AY Green Hinckley was born in Brampton, Derbyshire, England. She came to Utah with her mother when she was six years old. Her life has been one of faith and service. She has been active in the Church since her early girlhood. She served as a teacher in the Sunday School and in the Young Women's Mutual Improve- 'ment Association. From 1907- 1909 she served as a missionary in the Central States Mission. Upon returning home, she served as president of the Granite Stake Y. W. M. LA. For twelve years. In January of 1936, she was called with her husband, Bryant S. Hinckley, to preside over the Northern Page 312 States Mission. Soon after their release from the mission field, the First Presidency appointed her general president of the Primary Association, which position she held until her death on May 2, 1943. May Hinckley was an able executive and leader in her many and varied positions. She was a tireless worker and had unlimited energy. She knew how to work a little longer, a little harder, and a little better than most people. She had vision, understanding, good judgment, and enthusiasm. In her love and devotion for the work of the Lord she forgot self. As president of the Primary organization, the only desire of her heart has been to help the officers and teachers in the field that they might better teach the children to pray and to walk uptightly before the Lord. She served in humility and love. May Hinckley was endowed with the attributes of true success. She had a grateful heart, a thoughtful mind, a friendly smile, a kindly word, a helpful hand, and a loyal and courageous spirit. The beautiful floral tributes banked high on the stand in the Salt Lake Assembly Hall where her funeral services were held on Wednesday, May 5s, and the large attendance attested to the great love and esteem in which May' Hinckley was held. In her death, hundreds of people have lost a true friend; the Primary organization has lost a devoted leader; the Church has lost a loyal, faithful member; and the community has lost a great woman. Rachel Ridgway Ivins Grant Mary Grant Judd Member of Relief Society General Board (Part I of this two-part article appeared in the April issue.) RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT AND HER SON HEBER This picture was taken on President Grant's ninth birthday. N a December morning of the year 1856, it was bitingly cold in Salt Lake City. Dark and sombre it appeared to Rachel Ivins Grant, a pioneer wife who lay ill with her first-born, a son, in' an oldfashioned cradle beside her. On November twenty-second, the baby had been born and his life had almost cost her own. _It was but a few days before the birth of the son, that the father, Page 313 314 Jedediah M. Grant, a vigorous man in the prime of life, had collapsed. The strain of his responsibilities and the unusual efforts he had put forth as leader in the religious movement of that time known as the Reformation, had caused his health to break. A brief and severe illness attacked him, and when the baby Heber was nine days old, Rachel's husband died. On this morming when her husband was to be buried, she lay in her room on the second floor of the comfortable adobe dwelling which had been her home during the three short years of her married life. Later she heard the funeral throngs coming and going below and wished that she might have been able to attend the services for her husband which were to be held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle; for Jedediah M. Grant had been a man of prominence in the community, being not only mayor of the City, but also second counselor to President Brigham Young. It was three o'clock in the afternoon before Rachel heard the last strains of a funeral march die away and knew that this seemingly endless day would soon come to a close. How alone she felt only those can realize who, like herself, have forsaken friends and home for an unpopular religion. With the exception of an older sister Anna, her only kin was the small bundle of humanity beside her. This baby was all that she had to live and work for. She must have thought that here was her task; to teach her son of the father he had never known, and make of him the sort of man that father would have wished his son to be. How well she accomplished her high design, there are thousands to attest today. Rachel was left with but meagre financial resources. To earn a livelihood for herself and her boy she did fine hand sewing. But this class of work brought in so little, for the longspent hours, that she found it impossible to get ahead, and as time went by, it became increasingly hard for her to live on at the Grant homestead. When Rachel's son was six years old, it was decided among the heirs of Jedediah M. Grant to sell this property on Main Street (where Z. C. M. I. Now stands), and divide the proceeds. Rachel's share was five hundred dollars with which she bought a tiny home on Second East Street just below South Temple. Here, in hard circumstances, the young Heber was given \"the advantages of poverty\" and learned to appreciate his mother's independence of spirit as she uncomplainingly assumed the entire financial burden of her home. Thirty years later, speaking of these hard times in a letter to her son, Rachel had this to say: \"I never felt humiliated at having to work and support myself and you, and I thanked my Heavenly Father for giving me the strength and ability to do it. When talking to President Young I said if the Lord would give me health and strength, it was all I asked. And when thinking of many things I have passed through, hard and unpleasant, how happy it makes me now that I never complained, not even to my sister. I knew she would feel bad. I can talk about them now without caring.\" RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT Denying themselves all but the bare necessities of life, Rachel and Heber decided that they must save for one of the wonderful new sewing machines that were newly on the market. And when it was hers, the ambitious mother, after sewing all day in some other woman's house, would often return home, prepare supper, and when she and Heber had cleared away the meal and washed and wiped the dishes, she would go at her sewing again, working far into the night. The touching picture of her little boy sitting on the floor and, with his hands, working the treadles of the machine so that her tired limbs could rest, is one that has misted the eyes of many listeners of President Heber J. Grant's sermons as he eulogized his mother. \"Being Mother's -only child,\" he once said, \"we have been very dear to each other. I doubt if a mother and son were ever any nearer for she was both father and mother to me. Her tender love bound me to her with cords of steel.\" Rachel's was a very hospitable nature and she did not let her limited financial resources deter herself and her son from entertaining their friends. The little home saw frequent gatherings. \"Yes,\" she said later in speaking of those times, \"they loved to come and I loved to have them. Ofttimes Heber and I would live on very scanty fare that we might have the greater pleasure of sharing with our friends. 'Sister Grant,' the boys would say, 'we have such good times here.' \" N spite of her hardships, Rachel was happy in Utah, happier than she had been at an earlier date in 315 New Jersey, since physical hardships are always easier to bear than mental anxieties. So when her brother wrote from the East begging her to return and offering to settle upon her a substantial annuity for life, she declined to accept his offer; for there was a condition attachedshe must tenounce Mormonism for good and all and this she could not do. It was dearer to her than life itself. Rachel developed for herself, and taught her son, a philosophy of life that was simple and satisfying. She accepted her religion with childlike faith and left the mysteries for others to solve. She believed in the innate goodness of man springing from the actuality of God as his Father; that a Divine Providence makes and \"Shapes our lives and that no matter what happens, all will come right in the end. Her motto was, \"It is all for the best.\" Her son says of her: \"So near to the Lord would she get in her prayers that they were a wonderful source of inspiration to me from childhood to manhood. When success came she was thankful; when a child was born she thanked the Lord; and when a loved one died she always felt to acknowledge the hand of the Lord.\" While Rachel was still a young woman and Heber a lad, she had opportunity of putting her philosophy to the test. Could she say of the fresh trial that came, \"It is all for the best?\" Yes, she could and did. Following a severe attack of quinsy, she commenced losing her hearing and eventually was almost totally deaf. 'This tragic handicap she patiently bore to the close of her long life. Never again could she 316 hear or join in the congregational singing which she loved. Neither could she listen to the sermons of the brethren. Heber learned to throw his voice in a sharp staccato and could make her hear him when he was across the room, but all others had to place their mouths close against her ear to be understood. But though she could not hear what was going on, Rachel still attended her meetings to partake of the sacrament and enjoy the spirit of the occasion. And, in some inexplicable way, her thoughts were directed in the same channels as those of the speakers. 'This was especially true in the regular monthly fast meetings. She was a beautiful speaker and loved to bear her testimony. Often she would arise and speak right along the same line of thought which had been developed by the others. She continued the custom in her home of having family prayers night and morning. She would take her turn, even though she could not hear her own voice, and when it became Heber's turn he would kneel beside her and pray into her ear. With characteristic optimism Rachel discovered, among the many trying features of her deafness, some phases to be grateful for. She was spared much of the noise and confusion with which others were troubled, and it was so difficult for people to make her hear that they didn't bother to relay her gossip or anything of the kind. She expressed her attitude in these words: \"I grieve that I cannot hear, but while I cannot hear much of the good that is spoken, my peace is not marred by the evil that is spoken.\" Her son says of her: \"My mother was one of the most even-tempered and best dispositioned women that I have ever known.. I have often wished that I could have such a calm, peaceful temperament as she had. I do not recall ever seeing her angry or hearing her speak an unkind word.\" Rachel's natural friendliness, understanding, and sympathy, offset her handicap of deafness. People loved to be in her society and she loved people. She was made president of the Thirteenth Ward Relief Society and served in this charitable organization in this capacity for over thirty years. In season and out she visited the sick, went to the house of mourning, even caring for the dead, and, in every way, relieved suffering and distress. Her son says: \"Her absolute confidence in the hereafter was a great source of comfort and blessing in the hour of death to all with whom she came in contact.\" In early days there were no formal organizations centrally directing the several ward Relief Societies, the general board being a later development. 'There was, however, a group known as \"the leading women of the church\" and of this group Rachel formed a part. Here she was intimately associated with such outstanding characters as Eliza R. Snow, Bathsheba Smith, Emmeline B. Wells and others. As the widow of Jedediah M. Grant and an individual well-born in her own right, she retained the association and interest of the leaders of the Church, particularly President Brigham Young. As a boy, Heber had been playing on the floor at home when kindly RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT Bishop Woolley, father of the Thirteenth Ward, had called upon his mother and proffered the help of the ward to fix the leaky roof of her home.: He had heard her reply: \"I do not wish to be supported by the Church, I am too independent for that. 'The roof can wait until my son is older and can earn money enough to have it fixed.\" The young boy was greatly impressed by his mother's confidence in him. Then and there the financial aspect of life took on great importance as he resolved to repay her at the earliest possible time for her sacrifices in his behalf. This accounts for the fact that he left school at an early age and went into business for himself where he was signally successful. He lived to see the day when he was able to give his mother all the comforts of life. The religious teachings of his mother, however, and her fervent desire for him to emulate the example of his father and give his chief allegiance, not to business, but to his Church, were the determining factors in helping him to shape his life into what it has become. He learned that there are other things in life far more important than wealth. \"It is a glorious thing,\" he says, \"to be, like Nephi of old, 'born 317 of goodly parents,' it is of more worth than wealth or precious stones. No boy on earth could have had a better mother, and if I succeed in the battle of life, I will owe it all to her.\" Herein lay, not only Rachel's greatest joy, but a power above all unsought by her, which has perpetuated her name and made it shine out as one of the brightest among the women of the Church. When Rachel was eighty-one years old (seven years before her death), the following poem by Paul Shivell as being applicable to herself was sent her: \"Thou art the chosen mother of a son, Sent to thy care from heaven, as thou wert sent, To carry on the work by Christ begun, Who came from heaven to show us what God meant. As Mary was exalted by the event Which gave us Christ, so if thou give us one To do God's will, thou, too, shall rise content Above thy days, thy cup shall. Overrun With very joyance; and the grateful tears Of happy motherhood shall lift thy soul Like some fair cloud above the sea of _ years. Thou, by thy loving precepts, shalt control Men and affairs, and thyself glorify Our noble mothers were not born to die.\" Happy he, With such a mother! Faith in womankind Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high Comes easy to him...Tennyson."

            "content": "Concerning Antique Furniture Dear Helen: Your letter from New York reached me early this morning. If it is true that you have really become afflicted with \"antique fever,\" it is quite certain you will never fully recover. However, be cheered by the knowledge that in spite of your affliction you will experience delights that other people, not so affected, will never know. You say, \"What shall I do?\" \"How can I learn about antiques?\" \"Please tell me where to begin.\" You are wise to start to furnish your house gradually, and work to a plan, as it takes a long time to make a home. The true home depends upon the heart and the spint of those trying to make it. Some people can make a home with scarcely a stick of furniture in it. I'm glad you have that gift. You are also wise to do something as a rest from your strenuous war work. Did you know that in England Walt Disney was considered to have made one of the most valuable contributions during the last war by producing his funny cartoons and furnishing relief from war strain? That is interesting, isn't it? I'm afraid I can't help you much, but since you have requested it, I will tell you how we went about furnishing our home. Naturally, gathering our furniture was tied up with our travels, but one does not necessarily have to travel to find beautiful furniture. There is beauty everywhere, even in the remotest villages if we but have eyes to discover it. My notes will be hodgepodge, as we traveled to so many places at such irregular intervals. Page 318 It would be impossible to go into detail about all \"furniture periods,\" as there are more than fifty since prehistoric man. Egypt, Persia, China, Greece, Rome, Florence, Venice, and France all influenced later designs of furniture in other countries. A lotus design or any other particular pattern means that the makers of the original furniture on which it appeared were reproducing objects of nature about them. A wide seat in a chair usually indicates that the clothing of that particular period required more space than clothing of other times. 'The study of furniture will give you a most stimulating review of the history of the world with an intimate look at the home life of its people. When I began to furnish our home, I searched through magazines and books for suggestions. 'Then I visited all the big shops on the avenues in New York. The quantity of furniture I found there brought nothing but confusion to my mind. One day I was sure I liked Chippendale best; the next day I knew I preferred Sheraton; the next day it seemed as if the Queen Anne style was the only thing that would make our house right. Finally at John Wanamaker's, one of the most famous shops in the world, I found beautiful new furniture and lovely old pieces on the same floor, arranged with all the artistry of the great decorators. I looked at the shiny new pieces and then at the old. The new ones were spick and span; the old ones were more mellow with a lustre to the wood, aged and tried like an old friend. The more T looked at old pieces the more J CONCERNING ANTIQUE FURNITURE liked them, so I then tried to eliminate the styles I liked least. From that time my search for furniture was confined to places where old furniture was to be found. Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue had charming antique shops. Stepping into them I left the hustling, bustling atmosphere of New York behind and was transported to quiet salons filled with old-world commodes, tables, chairs, mirrors, and porcelains. From there I went to decorators' shops and auctioneers' sales, always trying to find what I really liked. During this time, I met Gertrude Gheen, an interior decorator, who was an artist with refined and discriminating taste. She was a great lover of homes, and thought all homes should be beautiful, as children were entitled to be brought up in beautiful surroundings. By this she did not mean expensive sutrroundings, but those which' conformed to the test of true beauty, simplicity, and a grace in line and form, which distinguishes it from the commonplace. Miss Gheen opened my eyes to the beauties of various styles of furniture. She also showed me pictures of lovely homes she had decorated. Looking at these pictures, I became aware that the rooms were not always done in matched sets, that the comfort and convenience of the people had been considered first, and the furniture suited to that purpose. Sometimes a lovely piece from one period was combined with other furniture of harmonizing styles. I realized that no one need be a slave of fashion. Gradually as I continued to observe and study the various periods, 319 The Sheraton clock has ticked for more than one hundred years. It now stands on a handmade Spanish rug, flanked by a walnut chair of a harmonizing period, and a walnut flower stand over which hangs an Italian mirror of the Renaissance influence. I found myself turning more and more to the period of Louis XVI, which held so much grace and charm without being pompous. My second choice was Sheraton because of the 'wonderful proportions used in his designs and the perfection of his structure. Sheraton, by the way, is credited with having made the first twin beds, and roll-top desk. He was also the first to make secret compartments in secretaries, desks, cabinets, and sideboards. My _ third choice was Colonial, as it is so homelike and refined. Fortunately, my husband liked the same styles, and told me to go ahead and choose the furniture for our apartment. Our living room was difficult to arrange. It was long and somewhat narrow, finishing off in a triangular end on Riverside Drive, overlooking the Hudson. The west wall was the long wall, so Miss Gheen suggested 320 The carved mahogany posts of the Sheraton bed are very effective against the chintz draperies. The side tables are also mahogany. 'The lamps are made from old bronze ums. The filet lace spread has been used on this bed for twenty-five years. For the center a long walnut Louis XVI sofa, which we found in a cabinetmaker's shop downtown. Then we found a pair of small mahogany two-shelf bookcases with white marble tops finished with a decorative brass gallery about one inch high. In addition a love seat, a kidney-shaped table, and a pair of carved bergere chairs, similar in feeling to the sofa, which we secured after considerable searching, made a good foundation for the room. Just at this time we were invited to take a motor trip with friends through New England. Such a trip is one of the most delightful in the world, up through Boston, visiting all the historic spots. The dignified New England houses reminded us of what the Puritans had done. The magnificent trees made us feel as if we had no need for houses. Maples, chestnuts, elms, and beeches arched over the highway in the villages andtowns, and covered the hills out in the country in the distance. And yet when night came, with its crisp autumn air, the sheltering roof of the inn was appreciated and the crackling logs in the fireplace drew our thoughts toward home. The inns were usually furnished with Early American or Colonial furniture. 'The walls were often of fine boards with little or no decoration. The windows were curtained with cretonnes and fish nets. Interesting old Bible boxes and pewter picces gave the atmosphere of olden days. The floors were made of wide pine boards often covered with hooked rugs. Sitting comfortably in these inns we could get the effect of the furniture and were able to make up our minds as to whether or not we liked it. As we drove to the various towns, we became very fond of it. We stopped to shop in the quaint stores. Our business soon took us to London. There we were introduced into many pleasant English homes. We shopped in Picadilly Circus where everything was so different from the skyscrapers of New York. Old things were on every side of us, offices, shops, and churches. The people were cheery and industrious, going about their business in fog and cold and acting as if it were a pleasant summer day. It was exciting to wander about in the streets, thinking of the history of the great city. We visited St. Paul's Cathedral which was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren after the great fire in London. He was a great lover of furniture as well as an architect and did much to make living conditions better for the CONCERNING ANTIQUE FURNITURE 321 A Louis XVI commode is the center of attraction in this group, although the painting, bergere chair (at right) and occasional chair (at left) all have appeal. People generally. By this time we had decided to use furniture in the Sheraton style for our bedroom and other English pieces in' the dining room. One day while shopping in a little side street, we found a shop which had a grandfather's clock which had been made by Thomas Fletcher of Leeds. The dealer also had a Sheraton four poster bed with a canopy which we liked very much. Both pieces were accepted by the custom officials as being over 100 years old so they could enter the United States duty free as works of art. We bought the pieces and asked to have them sent to New York. It was interesting to watch the dealer pack them. First, he took off the pendulum of the clock, then lifted off the old iron weights that worked the hands of the clock and the striker. Next his men wrapped the case in paper and heavy packing straw and crated it, with the weights and pendulum also carefully wrapped. Then the men unhooked the draperies from the bed, unscrewed the canopy, and laid them in a neat pile, lifted off the box springs and mattress (which we did not buy), unscrewed the beautiful mahogany front posts carved in a laurelleaf pattern, and unbolted the heavy back posts-and backboard. The carved posts were wrapped like the clock, then were crated with all the other -pieces. Both clock and bed went down without complaint, and undismayed by the long journey to a strange land seemed to say: \"Cheerio, old dears, we'll. See you in New York.\", We went to Paris in April. The 322 The inlaid walnut dressing table is lighted by old-fashioned china lamps made from a pair of vases. The mirrors on the wall are green Venetian glass with etched figures. Sycamores were just putting forth their pale green leaves; there was sunshine and rain; and the whole world seemed enchanted. Paris was a happy place in those days. The poilus were back from the war and nothing else mattered. The museums were open and afforded us endless delight. The shops too were among the most beautiful we had ever seen. Along the boulevards near the opera house was displayed furniture of nearly all French types; but we still preferred Louis XVI for its quiet grace. 'There were several pieces that suited us exactly, so we purchased them. One was a simple commode beautifully inlaid with various designs, completed by a marble top. Another was an attractive mirror mounted in a carved and painted wooden frame, which looked lovely with a pair of brass candelabra decorated with rock-crystal flowers. Another piece that we found was a little inlaid walnut dressing table, with folding leaves on each side of a small attached mirror. It had to be reconditioned. The dealer agreed to do this before we bought it. It was astonishing what a miracle he worked with a little glue, fine sandpaper, wood filler, stain, and furniture polish. This little table was shipped to New York with the rest of the things and has since traveled thousands of miles. It now reposes quietly in my room still doing its duty. Modern furniture makers say it's \"\"Goodbye, Mr. Chippendale,\" but I cannot agree. Somehow there grows up an irreplaceable affection and respect for an antique that has weathered the buffetings of family life for fifty years Or more. Before you begin your search for furniture, check over everything at your mother's, your grandmother's and your uncles' and aunts'. Often they have lovely old pieces that they have finished with. One of my most treasured possessions is a small rectangular mirror in a lustre plaster frame. It crossed the plains with my grandmother nearly a hundred years ago and although somewhat mottled still gives back our reflections today. I prize also the rag rugs made twentyfive years ago by the Relief Society of which my mother was president. Used and washed these many years, they have taken on the soft colorings of great paintings and are still giving remarkable service as did the loving hands that made them. Well, here's wishing you luck with your furniture and \"Happy Landing\" or shall I say \"Happy Finding?\" As ever yours, Adele Cannon Howells"

And it shall come, to pass, that inasmuch as they are faithful, and exercise faith in me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together. And it shall come to pass that they shall go forth into the regions round about, and preach repentance unto the people. THE 113th annual conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was held on April 4, 5, and 6, 1943. Once again, as at the two previous conferences because of the war, attendance was restricted to men holding certain callings in the Church, including some who formerly held them. Latter-day Saint soldiers holding the Melchizedek Priesthood who were free to attend were also invited to be present at the sessions, two of which were held on Sunday, three on Monday, and the final one on Tuesday morning. At the Sunday morning session, in addition to the usual Sunday morning Tabernacle Choir broadcast, the Church of the Air Address was delivered by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith of the Council of the Twelve on the subject, \"Blessed is the Nation Whose God is the Lord.\" The hearts of all those present in the tabernacle as well as the thousands of listeners over radio station KSL were touched and made to rejoice by the moving and beautiful statement of President Grant which was read by President David O. McKay at the opening of the conference sessions, Excerpts from this sermon Page 324 Doctrine and Covenants, Section 44. And those made by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. And President David O.- McKay are printed in this issue of the Magazine in the article by Elder Bryant S. Hinckley. 'The first and last sessions of the conference were broadcast over radio station KSL. Inspiring addresses were delivered and counsel given which will be heeded by all true Latter-day Saints. Church members were urged to obey the commandments of the Lord, to live lives of purity, to be loyal to Church leadership, and to render unselfish service to one another. As at the conference last October, saints residing in Salt Lake City opened their homes to house the conference brethren visitors. 'This condition was reminiscent of earlier days in the valley, when conference visitors were welcomed into Salt Lake homes and their visits were eagerly anticipated for many months. Such hospitality tends to strengthen the bond of fellowship in the Church. Conferences have ever been an integral part of Church procedure. On June 9, 1830, little more than two months after the Church was organized, the first conference as an organized Church was held at Fayette, New York. MAY 1943 No. 5 EDITORIAL The Prophet Joseph wrote of this conference: Our members were about thirty, besides whom many assembled with us who were either believers or anxious to learn.... Much exhortation and instruction was given, and the Holy Ghost was poured out upon us in a miraculous manner.... Such scenes as these were calculated to inspire our hearts with joy unspeakable, and fill us with awe and reverence for that Almighty Being, by whose grace we had been called to be instrumental in bringing about, for the children of men, the enjoyment of such glorious blessings that were now at this time poured out upon us. From that June day of 1830 until the present, conferences of the Church have been held, usually open to the general membership but at times restricted to the Priesthood. A review of the places where conferences have been held would recall 325 the scenes made memorable in Church history. As at the first,. So at the 113th conference, \"glorious blessings were now at this time poured out upon us.\" Present at the last conference were the most powerful men now living upon the earth. At the head sat the Prophet of the Lord who holds the keys to powers pertaining to this earth and the heavens. When all earthly powers and principalities will have passed away, the power of the Priesthood will remain throughout the eternities. Church' members have ever rejoiced at the privilege of attending general conferences and longingly look forward to the day when conditions will once more permit general gatherings of the saints at general conferences, there to be fed the bread of lifeM. C. S. = Memorial Semple to GYefferson GREAT marble shrine to Thomas Jefferson was dedicated by President Roosevelt on April 13, 1943, the 200th anniversary of the birth of Jefferson. The memorial is situated on the south bank of the Tidal Basin in Washington, D. C. It is fitting that at this time the freedom-loving patriot, Thomas Jefferson, should be honoredThomas Jefferson who wrote in 1800, \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" Jefferson was one of the great modern liberals; he was the first American statesman to make education by the State a fundamental article of democratic faith; he wrote the first statute of religious freedom; he refused to be elected as president for the third time although requested by the legislatures of five States to be a candidate, and thus helped to establish a precedent which he believed to be of great importance under a democratic government; and he was the writer of the immortal Declaration of Independence. Abraham Lincoln said, \"The principles of Jefferson are the axioms of a free Society.\" \"The range of his interestsin geography, geology, botany, zoology, ethnology, agriculture, plantation, medicine and surgery, mathematics, 326 aeronautics, invention, government, education [music], languages and literature, religionis astounding.\" He compiled from the New Testament a book of Jesus' teachings known as Jefferson's Bible. He never used tobacco, never gambled, never played cards, nor was party to a personal quarrel. He was only truly happy in the country and was buried on his country estateMonticello, in Virginia, where he lies under a plain stone monument for which he chose the epitaph: \"Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of the American Independ ence, of the statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and father of the University of Virginia.\" The memorial temple, 176 feet in height, is circular and built in a modified form of the Roman Pantheon, with twenty-six [onic columns topped by a white dome. A nineteenfoot plaster statue of Jefferson to be cast in bronze after the war, stands in the interior between two American flags. 'The memorial completes the fourth point of a cross formed by the Capitol, White House, and Lincoln Memorial, with the Washington Monument in the center and the axis formed by the Mall. <~f Agnes Mm Bolto Appointed to Relief Society General Board PPOINTMENT by the First Presidency of Agnes M. Bolto as a member of the Relief Society General Board was announced Wednesday, May 5, 1943, by President Amy Brown Lyman. At the time of her appointment to the General Board, Mrs. Bolto was president of the Granite Stake Relief Society. Her testimony of the Gospel, her long years of excellent service in Relief Society together with her native endowments and specialized training, will qualify her for her new position as a member of the General Board. Her many friends will be pleased to learn of this appointment, and her new associates on the General Board welcome her as a valued fellow Board member. A short biographical sketch of Mrs. Bolto will appear in the June issue of the Magazine."

VYlotesd 10 THE FIELD Ussiting Seaching HE month of May concludes the 1942-43 Relief Society educational season. During the four summer months, June through September, no regular classwork is conducted, but the monthly work-andbusiness meeting and monthly visits by the visiting teachers should be continued as usual. As was indicated at the Relief Society general conference in October 1940, and included in Blue Bulletin No. 26, June 24, 1942, arrangements may be made for each visiting teacher to have one month free during the summer, if desired, by using substitute teachers or by having teachers go singly one or two months, as necessary. During the summer, visiting teachers may visit without discussing a uniform topic, or may take into the homes any special messages provided by the stake or ward. Where the stake or ward has no special message to present, visiting teachers desiring subjects suitable for discussion in the home are referred to TheSuch articles as the following might appropriately be used: \"The Promise of the Gospel in Helping Us To Meet Present-Day Crises,\" President David O. McKay, March 1942, page 162; \"Family Prayer,\" Ray R. McKay, April 1942, page 254; \"Preserving Our Homes In Wartime,\" Mark K. Allen, July 1942, page 453; \"Mental Health Through Recreation,\" Mark K. Allen, November 1942, page 770; \"Brotherhood,\" Elder Harold B. Lee, February 1943, page 84; \"Radio Address,\" President Amy Brown Lyman, April 1943, page 236. Visits of visiting teachers should be friendly and short, and timed as opportunely for the women in the home as possible. Ifa woman is very busy, it is recommended that visiting teachers merely inquire as to the well-being of the family, extend an invitation to Relief Society meetings or other functions to be held during the month, deliver very briefly any necessary message, and then leave, stating that they will spend more time on their next visit when she may not be so busy. Visiting teachers are cautioned about repeating startling statements that cannot be verified, or discussing sensational subjects based on rumor. All topics discussed in the home should be based on authentic information, and should be helpful and encouraging. This not only makes the visit more profitable, but makes the visiting teachers more welcome in the home. The recommendations of the General Board regarding visiting teaching requiring automotive transportation, issued early in 1942 and effective during the period while there is limitation of automotive travel, are repeated here: 1. That visiting teaching be continued as usual where districts are within walking distance; 2. That where districts are scattered such districts be sub-divided, wherever practicable to do so, so that a smaller number of families may be visited by perhaps only one visiting teacher who lives in the neighborPage 327 328 hood and is within walking distance of the families in such smaller districts; 3. That where distances make it impracticable for visits to be made, the unvisited members take their contributions to the regular Relief Society meetings; 4. That those stakes which print leaflets for visiting teachers to distribute in the homes might send such leaflets by mail to unvisited families, or that such families might be called by telephone where this service is available, but that such communications should: not be counted as actual visits. Directions for keeping track of communications which are made in lieu of regular visits are given in the instructions in the back of the new visiting teachers' report books, under the heading '\"\"Communications in Lieu of Visits.\" One of the important duties of visiting teachers is to acquaint Latterday Saint women with the Relief Society program and to encourage participation in Relief Society activities. This is particularly important this year in areas where defense and war work have caused an influx of workers into the community, many of whom are Latter-day Saints and need to be brought actively into the work of the Society. Recent surveys have been made under the direction of ward bishops to identify new families living in their respective wards. 'The General Board recommends that Relief Society officers cooperate fully with their bishops in identifying and welcoming the Salvage VERY woman is anxious to do all in her power to help win the war and bring about peace. One effective way in which women may contribute to the war effort is to salvage materials that are so critically neededhousehold fats, tin cans and newcomers and in enlisting them as active members. Relief Society presidents are urged to procure from their bishops the names of new Latter-day Saint families to be added to the regular visiting-teacher list. When visiting these new families, special effort should be made to acquaint them with various Relief Society and other ward activities and to make them feel welcome. It is also suggested that visiting teachers notify the ward president, who in turn would notify the bishop, of any new Latter-day Saint families coming to their attention when making their regular visits. 'The opportunity Relief Society has for contacting the wives in the new households in every ward constitutes one of the most important points of beginning in the entire Church program in the interest of new families moving into various communities because of defense work.; Relief Society visiting teachers hold an important position in the Relief Society organization. The effectiveness of their work is dependent upon their understanding of their duties and responsibilities, and the spirit and diligence with which they meet these responsibilities. 'The General Board sincerely appreciates the splendid efforts of Relief Society visiting teachers. Program metals of any kind, silk and nylon hose, unusable clean cloth of all kinds, fur, and old and broken phonograph records. Depots have been arranged at stores for collection of fats, hosiery, and phonograph records. Local sal-"

It is suggested that some local Relief Societies may wish to handle collection of old or broken phonograph records from their members or others in the community, as a means of adding funds to their treasury while at the same time making available for use the valuable shellac for which the records are salvaged. ~ Information as to the collection of these various items may be _ obtained 329 from your local salvage committee. The demand for these materials is becoming greater each day the war goes on, and to meet the demand the aid of every individual on the home front is solicited. The Relief Society desires its members throughout the United States to cooperate fully with their respective salvage committees by announcing in Relief Society meetings the collections which are conducted from time to time by their local salvage committees, and by individually supporting the various salvage collections as they are conducted. Summer Program of Primary Association HE Relief Society General Board commends the Primary Association upon the splendid program it is conducting for children, particularly during the summer months when children are not in school and have time on their hands, and when they are working in fields and orchards and need the relaxation that comes from directed play or other activities. 'The program for the current summer quarter features profitable activities of many types, each ward being allowed to select the acPamphlet Available, tivies best suited to its needs. Children as well as adults are affected by war conditions. During war periods it is particularly important that they be given opportunity to participate in interesting, profitable, well-directed activities such as the Primary Association provides. The General Board. Recommends that Relief Society women wholeheartedly support the Primary program, and that they use their influence to have children attend regularly. 'How FRO) Vin on the Home Front ' HE General Board has on hand, T through arrangements made by the National Council of Women, a quantity of pamphlets entitled \"How to Win on the Home Front,\" issued in 1942 by the Public Affairs Committee, Incorporated. The pamphlet contains valuable information for the homemaker during wartime on such important subjects as: Scarcity, Higher Prices, Poorer Quality; The Rules of WarRationing, Quality and Standards, Credit Control, Taxes and War Bonds; Home Front StrategyA Plan of Action, Budgeting for Health, Stretching the 330 Food Dollar, Clothing and Miscellaneous Items, Housing Upkeep, and Going Places and Doing Things. Relief Societies desiring to do so may use this pamphlet as the basis for discussions in summer work-and-business meetings. The information contained in this pamphlet has been obtained largely from the publications of the Bureau of Home Economics of the Department of Agriculture, the Consumers' Guide, and Consumer Tips of the Consumers' Counsel of the Department of Agriculture, and official releases of the Office of Price Administration. Information on taxes and savings came from the United States Treasury. Due to the necessity of changes in rationing and the government price control program, some of the information on these subjects is not now current. Nevertheless, the pamphlet contains much valuable information. Although first made available at ten cents each, a limited supply of these pamphlets has been made available to Relief Society without charge. As long as the supply lasts, the General Board will meet requests for copies from Relief Society officers or members. Address requests to the General Board of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City, Utah. Potitions on Informative Labeling N Blue Bulletin No. 29, issued December 29, 1942, the General Board suggested that all Relief Societies in the United States cooperate with the National Council of Women in petitioning the Office of Price Administration to require that goods bear informative labels clearly stating what an article is, of what it is made, what service it will give, and how it should be cared for. Signed petitions were to be sent to the National Council. The Relief Society is highly commended for its efforts in this important matter in a letter recently received by the General Board from Charlotte Payne, Executive Secretary of the National Council. The following quotations are from Miss Payne's letter: You should have had a dozen letters in the past month because each mail has brought such enthusiastic response to the request for signatures on the petitions that we just beam at the very mention ofthe Relief Society! I think that a fair estimate of the number of signatures which we have had from your wards would be about 9,000 covering 33 states with almost 5,000 from Utah alone. We cannot tell you how proud and pleased we are with this evidence of your interest and cooperation. You know that we plan to present the petitions to Mr. Prentiss Brown. Meanwhile, our efforts along this line have already produced results. The recent stocking regulation is the first one in which informative labeling is a part of the requirement. Miss Payne further states that when a meeting is arranged with Mr. Brown, a Relief Society representative will accompany the group. \"This,\" she states, \"seems only fair since Relief Society has taken so active a part.\""

            "content": "Informative Labeling of Hosiery This article, obtained from Justin C. Stewart, is of special interest to Relief Society women since it deals with the regulation on stockingsthe first regulation of goods in which informative labeling is a part of the requirement. Relief Society women, in cooperation with the National Council of Women, recently petitioned the Office of Price Administration to require that goods bear informative labels. HE new OPA \"dollars and cents\" ceiling price regulation for rayon hose, effective April 15, reduces the amount American women wil] have to pay for their stockings from 5 to 40 cents per pair. The total amount women will save on their hosiery purchases during 1943 is about 15 per cent and will amount to an estimated 50 million dollars on their hosiery bill in a single year. A feature of the new regulation of particular interest to Relief Society members and others familiar with grades and standards for consumer goods is the provision which requires manufacturers to make their hose according to grade specifications and to label the hose accordingly if they wish to receive the maximum price. Grade \"A\" hosiery will contain features designed to lengthen the life and improve service, such as reinforcements in the foot and top and a minimum number of inches of stitches in the leg to prevent \"skimpy' construction. All stockings which fail to meet the OPA standards for Grade \"A\" will be classified and must be labeled as Grade \"B,\" irregulars, seconds, or thirds, and will be sold at proportionately lower prices. The ceiling prices vary from 12 cents for the cheapest construction of seamless \"thirds\" to as high as $1.43 for the most expensive continuous filament full-fashioned rayon. After the present stocks of hose in the hands of merchants are exhausted, stockings will appear on merchants' shelves with the grade labels marked on the hose at the factory. The new regulation recognizes that the methods of operation and wholesale costs vary between stores, and that, consequently, the operating costs are different. Accordingly, two ceiling prices are established for each hose, depending on the \"class\" of store in which the sale is made. Following are typical ceiling prices: 51 gauge full-fashioned ceiling price either 3 cents or $1.05 45 gauge full-fashioned ceiling price either 81 cents or 92 cents 42 gauge full-fashioned ceiling price either 75 cents or 84 cents 340 Needle Bare-leg ceiling price either 47 cents or 53 cents In announcing the price ceilings, OPA has emphasized that faullfashioned hosiery is still in its infancy and that rayon as material for fullfashioned hose was largely experimental as recently as 1941. Studies are continuing to determine if the standards of rayon hose can be further improved and prices will be adjusted either upward or downward whenever experience proves this to be necessary. In establishing the standards and prices, OPA held extensive meetings with representatives of the hosiery industry, labor, retailers, consumer groups, and technical experts of the OPA and War Production Board as well as other standardization agencies in order to secure the best advice available in the country.

            "content": "Care of Children In Wartime HE General Board, aware of the many problems confronting mothers today, particularly that of safeguarding children, publishes the following letter from Katharine F. Lenroot, Chief, Children's Bureau, U. S. Department of Labor. We, along with other churches, law-enforcement agencies, and public and private welfare agencies, are greatly concerned over the alarming increase of juvenile delinquency throughout the country. We are particularly concerned because many L. D. S. Youths are among the juvenile offenders. Church auxiliary organizations have announced special programs designed to interest our children and youth and profitably direct their activities. 'The Primary Association will conduct an excellent summer program, including both work and play activities. 'The Y. W. M. LA. Plans to conduct a summer program for 20,000 BeeHive girls, directed toward effective war service work. These programs Dear Mothers and Fathers: merit the full support of mothers or the Church. However, the task of properly caring for and directing children cannot be left to Church auxiliaries; it devolves primarily upon parents. 'The General Board urges mothers throughout the Church to place every possible safeguard about their children. An evil influence is abroad which threatens even the best homes. Social problems, greatly aggravated by the war, demand vigilance on the part of mothers. There is no substitute for mothers in the home, and they should not leave the home to earn money unless real necessity demands it and unless proper provision is made for children while the mother is away. Parents should also make sure that both boys and girls who leave home to take employment are satisfactorily located in homes with interested relatives or other responsible adults, where they may be properly supervised. May 1, 1943 Have you been wondering whether you are doing everything you can for your children during this war period?... If ever children needed mothering and fathering, they need it now.... Your Johnny and Jane know lots of things are different at home today. There will be more changes tomorrow. Both for you and for them many of these changes are hard to take. But with you there, throwing your confidence and pluck and affection around Johnny and Jane, they'll not be hurt. These are the foods your children grow on, just as much as the bread they eat. They need such food every A child's spirit can be undernourished as well as his body. Day of their growing lives. Your faith, and your courage, and your love are Grade A foods for your child's spirit. There are no others as good. Of course it takes time to give children that quality of care. Just as you willingly give the time it taks to provide the carrots, milk, and other Page 332 CHILDREN IN WARTIME 333 foods you give your child, you'll be glad later for the extra time you spend now in giving him affectionate guidance. Behind many a youngster in trouble is a parent overburdened with work, who thought he or she was too busy for children. Because the job you are doing is so tremendously vital to the Nation, a Children's Bureau Commission on Children in Wartime is helping our Bureau to help you in every way we can. Millions of you parents, during war, will have no choice but to yield to someone else some part of the place you have in your children's lives. Some fathers must go to war. Some mothers must leave home to work. To those of you who must, the doctors say: Keep the channels of affection and the lines of communication to your children as wide open as you can. If Dad must be away from home altogether, try to put your children in touch with some other male relative who will keep an affectionate eye on your charges. Group activities, directed by men in the neighborhood or in school or church, will help your young ones without changing their loyalty and affection for their fathers. And when Dad leaves be sure that, if possible, the letters keep coming back home. Fathers who are at home can help mightily, too, if they will take time to spread their companionship to neighbors' children who must wait until war is over to welcome home their own fathers. And you, Mother. If you are one of the millions of mothers who do your war job of caring for your children at home, maybe you can give some of yourself to the children of other mothers, too. Perhaps you can help at the baby clinic, or with school lunches, or on playgrounds.... If you are a mother who must earn money away from home, get the best possible substitutes you can for the care you would otherwise provide. If you can't find or can't afford someone to come into your home, use every help your community provides for children. If you don't know what they are, yout local defense council will be glad to give you suggestions. Last but not least, especially watch over your older boys and girls, who are having to grow up so fast. 'They may need to be guarded against overtaxing their strength. They may want your aid in finding ways of helping that will make them feel important in your grownup world. Above all, they deserve the kind of advice that understanding friends give to each other. You see how big a job you fathers and mothers have in your hands right now. It's a war job of the highest priority rating. There are no uniforms to wear to distinguish this public service. No medals will come to you if you do well. But the bearing and grace of your child as he lives his days bravely and with fine spirit will be the match of any medal. Sincerely yours, Katharine F. Lenroot, Chief, Children's Bureau, U. S. Department of Labor"

            "content": "Planned Strategy for the Garden Pests Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, The Deseret News FTER the spring planting has all been done and the garden has begun to put out fresh new growth, then trouble usually creeps in like the proverbial villain in the play, to try the heart and spirit of the home gardener. All during the hopeful spring planning and planting season the garden pests have lain in wait until some choice favorite plant would be spreading its beautiful green leaves, perhaps even showing a few promising buds. Only then do the exasperating insects attack like some vile thief in the night, and they often do great damage before the unsuspecting gardenmaker discovers their presence. Every home gardener must anticipate this annual invasion, for seldom do gardens escape being attacked by one or another of the common garden pests. 'There is no use. To wring one's hands and lament the matter, we must meet such a common emergency with a fighting spirit. We must be prepared with a planned program of defense by having modern spray equipment ready and waiting to drive the invaders out as soon as they appear. We must arm ourselves with the wherewithall for making a fighting stand, for preparedness and perseverance are two-thirds of the battle in fighting these troublemakers. Page 334 Most of these common garden pests come under one of three types: there are the chewing insects, the sucking kinds, and the fungous spores and other plant diseases. If you suddenly discover some plant is being eaten, either the foliage, buds, or tender stems, then you can be sure that you are entertaining one of the chewers (and these come in many fancy sizes, shapes, and forms). The cure for this type of pest is poison spread over the entire plant, foliage, buds, and stems, so that no matter where Mr. Bug next chooses to dine, he will find a dose sufficient to stop his career of crime. This can be applied by means of either a liquid spray or in powder form, spreading the powder with a dusting gun. Arsenate of lead is the chemical usually employed in most spray preparations for control of the chewers, although pyrethrum and Paris green are also used. The sucking insects present a different problem for they do not eat the foliage, but thrust a long proboscis or beak into the tender juicy new growth and suck out the very life blood of the plant, its sap, causing it to wither and often even die. The suckers are usually very small, the commonest being the plant aphis, stealthy creatures of great ingenuity who congregate on the underside of the leaves, the stems, and in the crevices. These mild-appearing but PLANNED STRATEGY FOR THE GARDEN PESTS murderous small insects increase at such an alarming rate that unless something is done to control them, they often completely ruin an entire year's crop. But the poison spray which is so effective against the chewing insects is useless in fighting this type. Instead of poisoning them, we must apply a product which will kill them by suffocating them with poison fumes. Nicotine is the usual cure, and it too is available in either liquid or powder form and under many different trade names. The fungous diseases require dusting with sulphur or copper to control bacteria or fungous growth such as mildew, the plant disease which so often attacks roses, and other plants, spreading its gray powdery mass over foliage and stems, causing disfigurement. Fortunately for the home gardener, there are now several preparations which contain all three of these different types of insecticides so that one can use one spray for the control of all garden pests. 'This is the most practical method for the amateur, and the one which gives best results. Reliable nurserymen can supply such all-purpose sprays that will do the trick if they are used early in the season, and even before the pests have made their appearance. It is the same old story of an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure. If a spraying or dusting program is carried out at regular intervals during the year, it is quite possible to keep any garden free from insect damage. But the gardener must apply the remedy thoroughly and early, followed by other applications, especially in the case of the sucking types. 335 The dusting gun is most popular with many gardeners because this is so easily used, and this should be equipped with a long extension rod so that the dust may be applied from the ground upward to reach the underside as well as the upper leaves. The dust spreads out in a cloud, reaching more surface than the liquid spray. Such a dusting gun can be purchased for the sum of one dollar. Here are a few rules to help the gardener to have a pest-free garden: 1. Keep the garden well raked and tidy; many pests live and hide underneath old trash, boards, or wood left lying about. 2. Purchase rust-proof and _ wilt-proof seeds of many annuals and vegetables as offered in catalogues. 3. Do not crowd the plantings, but allow plenty of air between plants. 4. Rotate the different crops each season; certain pests attack only certain crops, and by moving crops about the diseases. Or insects that live over in the soil will be avoided.. Do not water roses in late afternoon or night, this encourages mildew. 6. Keep out of the garden when plants are wet, for mildew and other fungi will cling to clothing and be spread when wet. 7. Cultivate the surface regularly, this destroys many pests. Wi HERE are a few other common \"plant and garden pests which require other methods, the commonest being the grasshopper which has been so troublesome of recent years. This pest is best handled by spreading a poisoned bait, a new product called Bug-Geta being easily used to fight not only grasshoppers, but cutworms, sowbugsthe small flat creeper which rolls itself up into a round ball when disturbedsnails, slugs, and weevils. 336 The lover of gladioli should also be well prepared with a spray to use in the control of thrips, the insect which causes such havoc in this beautiful flower. One can do much to fight this pest by soaking the bulbs for eight to ten hours in a solution of one quart warm water to one teaspoonful of lysol, just before planting. But in addition, one must spray with a solution made by mixing one heaping tablespoon of Paris green, two pounds of brown sugar or any sweet syrup, and three gallons of water. 'This spray should be used as soon as the leaves are about six inches high, and followed by two other sprayings a week apart. This will md any planting of this pest which so often ruins whole crops of flowers. Does all this seem a melancholy and distasteful business to one who starts out. To make beauty, and to grow pleasant and delicious vegetables? We admit that it is not the most enjoyable of the many garden jobs, but our complex modern life has brought pests from countries far and wide into our gardens, and only by taking a sensible attitude and by equipping ourselves to cope with them can we hope to escape pest troubles. Let us cheerfully include these few simple tasks as a regular part of successful gardening, just as weeding and watering are a necessary part of its upkeep. We can promise that the gardener will be well repaid for such efforts, especially if she will begin the program of dusting or spraying early before the pests have established themselves. We can well apply that old axioman ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and the rewards are great.

Paul was so elated at the prospect of the baby's coming that he could talk of little else. When they were packed and ready to leave the mesa, he said regretfully:\n\"I hate to get back to civilization!\"\nJanet smiled above his head as he fitted his own long stirrups to her feet. How would he feel if he knew they were going to Washington, D. C. Soon! But that revelation was something that could wait. The world was a wonderful place in spite of places you didn't like. It was brimming with loveliness today. And happiness, too. One needed only to dip one's cup and be filled.\nTomorrow she would have less to blind her to realities. Back at El Toro there'd be no firelight in caves to hold her under a spell. In the clear light of day, things would be seen as they were. Tomorrow would be soon enough.\n\"How's that?\" Paul patted her boot into the stirrup.\n\"Fine. But you have to ride bareback all the way.\"\n\"I'm one cowboy that can ride without a saddle. I'm so darned\nPage 348\nhappy I could ride a rail and not know it!\"\n\"How can I tell him?\" Janet thought remorsefully. \"What right have I to tell him where he ought to live?\"\n\"But you're not telling him,\" her brain argued. \"You're just saying where you're going to live.\"\n\"Which is one and the same thing!\" she reminded herself honestly.\n\"This week is something to remember, Janet. Something we may both wish for in the days to come.\"\nAll the lilt had gone from Paul's voice, and it seemed to Janet that her thoughts had betrayed her. There was so much she wanted to say, so much that had to be said between them, that she couldn't say any of it. And before she could think of a safe approach Paul began to sing.\nHe had a grand voice, Janet noted in surprise. She had heard him hum snatches of cowboy airs, but never really sing as he was doing now. For the first few miles he sang college and operatic songs, but as the mood deepened between them his voice softened to tender melodies she had not heard in years. When he sang \"Sweet and Low,\" the lump that was in Janet's throat tightened into tears.\nAfter that Paul talked or was silent as her mood changed; but nothing could dampen the ardor in his eyes when he looked at her. By the time they were in sight of El Toro, Janet was wearied by her own thoughts. Paul was as big and mysterious as his country. They'd\nTOMORROW'S CUP\nbeen married three years, and this week alone with him had shown her how little she had known of the real person he was. The man behind the westerner. She'd known so little of him; had taken the path her heart suggested, the path she'd known always in spirit. Only a week ago she had thought there'd be no Harvard, no football for her sononly cowboys and cows. And she'd tripped herself with her own thinking.\nPaul, with amazing foresight, had taken the reins.\n\"You know, Janet,\" he said, uncannily baring her thoughts, \"people are just people, fine and good, or coarse and bad, wherever they are, and very, very often a little of both. And here we are, just two people, home again.\"\n\"Paul\" There was apology in Janet's voice, \"I've been happy up there on the mesa, Paul. AndAnd now we're back to civilization.\"\n\"And where we started from?\"\n\"No. Not quite.\"\n\"You've gone a little way along my road, Jan. Let me tell you that, gratefully, will you?\"\nNow. Now was the time, Janet's mind urged. Not now, her heart pleaded. Not ever, please not ever. She knew that she had only to say to Paul that she could not go all the way along his road and her fight would be won. Triumphantly she knew that he was hers, against the country he loved as his life, against the world. She had only to say, \"I'm afraid here, Paul,\" and her cup would be full. Tomorrow's cup would brim with all the joys she'd dreamed the world could hold.\nInstead she said: \"Quite an elegant long blue\n349\ncar has taken possession in our absence, Paul.\"\nShe would have pointed toward El Toro but could not trust her hand; its shaking would betray her. Somehow, without hurting Paul, her fight must be won. She could not, would not give up.\n\"So I see,\" Paul said, and his eyes never left the car in question. \"It's parked almost in the front door! You'llYou'll be glad to have company.\"\n\"Something we may both wish for in the days to come.\" Paul's words ringing in her ears. Paul refusing to look at her.\n\"Maybe it's just cattle buyers,\" she said hopefully.\n\"It's too racy. It's company all right,\" Paul said, and there was a pained edge to his voice.\n\"Paul, couldcould we slip in the back way?\"\nA joyous bark from Taos turned their attention to the door. Janet took one look at the beautiful woman standing there and flew into her arms.\n\"Rhae! What a blessed surprise!\"\n\"Janet!\" There was barely time for the embrace before the woman continued, \"Janet, it's good to see you. But in such a place! I never dreamed it would be quite this bad!\"\nPaul took in her words and the elegant male that stood behind her on the porch, and disliked them both cordially. The man spoke:\n\"I say, summer comes down in one fell swoop in this country!\"\n\"Just as some people,\" Paul thought, but\"The women seem to know each other!\" is what he said.\n350\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, Paul,\" Janet cried. \"This is my sister, Rhae, and her husband, Warren Newsbaum. I'm so excited I forget you have never seen them. Get acquainted, you two, I can't see anyone except Rhae.\"\n\"She's decidedly worth looking at,\" Paul remarked gallantly; then belied his words by turning immediately to Warren Newsbaum. \"I begin to see, Janet.\"\nRhae Newsbaum sized Paul up frankly. \"If you can't have cake with icing, then, you just take cake.\"\nThere were sparks in Paul's eyes. Janet hurried the Newsbaums into the house.\n\"Welcome to El Toro,\" she cried, including everything in the sweep of her arms. \"I'll bet you're starved. Dinner, Juanee. I'll not even stop to dress.\"\n\"Do we ever?\" Paul's frankness sent a hot flush over Janet's face, and Paul was instantly sorry for his remark. He could see he was undoing all that the week had built up between them, but he didn't like airs, and the sooner these people found it out the better.\n\"This is a cattle country,\" he said in scant apology.\nHe couldn't believe that Janet had known her folks were coming, but the timing was too perfect to be comfortable. And long before dinner was finished he had formed a pretty clear idea of why they had come. First one Newsbaum and then the other made things very plain. It was, \"poor Janet this, and poor Janet that\" through three courses. The dessert was served to: \"This is so foreign to all you've been accustomed, Janet, dear. I wonder how you endure it. I'm sure I'd die of boredom!\" That was Rhae's contribution. Her\nRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEMAY 1943\nhusband added the indigestible: \"Whatever do you do for amusement?\" His remark was addressed to Janet but his eyes looked to Paul for reply. It was nothing short of a challenge.\n\"We poke fun at tenderfeet for amusement,\" Paul told him pleasantly. \"Their antics are a source of never-ending enjoyment.\"\nJanet covered Warren's confusion with questions of home. The real thunderbolt struck when Rhae pointedly remarked: \"Poor father is quite frail; it will prolong his life to know that you are coming home, Janet.\"\nPaul's heart skipped a beat. \"To stay indefinitely?\" his eyes inquired of Janet. Then he settled the question coolly. \"As I remember it, Janet, your father loved this country. When your visit is up will you send him back to us here, Rhae?\"\nCompletely baffled by Paul's innocently engaging smile, Rhae had no retort. \"And it serves her right,\" Janet thought. \"Announcing her plans as if they were fully considered and accepted by everyone.\"\nWarren Newsbaum took up the uncomfortable slack. \"I say,\" he said, \"you haven't a broncho horse I could ride have you?\"\n\"Plenty of them, and they're no trick at all to ride! You'd have the time of your life on Caesar.\"\nJanet looked at Paul in consternation. Caesar was the wickedest horse that ever came off a range. Tractable as a kitten in Paul's hands, but a devil at heart. Not a man on the desert would throw a leg across his back.\n\"But if you're not used to riding\" Paul began.\nTOMORROW'S CUP\n\"Oh, I ride frequently!\" Newsbaum assured him. Rhae looked at her husband in surprise; she started to speak and decided not to. Which in itself should have warned both of them.\n\"Shouldn't we decide on the entertainment of our guests after they've had a good night's sleep, Paul?\" Janet's eyes implored, but she managed to keep her voice light, even through a hint of tears.\nPaul looked at her anxiously. How could he have forgotten that Janet was tired and excited by the day's crowded events? He summoned Juanee.\n\"Are the guest rooms ready?\" he asked.\nJuanee nodded. Rhae and Warren rose from the table; the plurals had escaped neither of them.\n\"Well, upon my word, are we to have a suite, then? Not so rural after all, is it Warren?\"\nJanet knew Rhae was deliberately baiting Paul. \"You'll find us very comfortable here,\" she defended.\n\"Decidedly,\" Warren said. \"I shall not rest, however, till I've had a chance at your horse. Caesar you call him?\"\n\"Goodnight, Rhae and Warren,\" Janet interposed hurriedly. \"Sleep late. We're Mexicans enough to like drowsy hours. Here at El Toro it's an affront to stir out of bed before the sun is well up.\"\nThe sun had never found Paul Morgan in bed in twenty years. \"But,\" he thought, \"if it'll keep these strangers out of sight for a few hours I'll see what I can do.\"\n\"Caesar never bucks before eleven o'clock, Newsbaum,\" he said genially. \"How'd you like to ride him at ten?\"\n351\n\"He should be warmed up by twelve,\" Warren countered, \"I'll book him for twelve.\"\nAnd Paul began to like the fellow. \"I hope you'll be worth salvaging, Warren,\" Rhae said sweetly. She kissed Janet and without a glance in Paul's direction, took herself and her husband off to bed.\nBy eleven o'clock the pole fence around the corral was lined with boot heels and stetsons. Janet could not figure it out. Paul had not left the ranch, yet every cowboy for miles around knew there was a tenderfoot spree on. Warren, dressed to the minute in purple shirt, red silk kerchief, spurs and chaps, had gone nattily to the slaughter. Rhae sat reading in the west patio, pointedly oblivious to what was going on.\nJanet questioned Juanee. Had Joe spread the word? Had he been gone in the night? Juanee became all squaw and refused to talk.\nJanet wasn't really worried; Paul wouldn't let Warren get hurt. But she didn't see how Rhae could sit there as if nothing were going on. Curiosity, if nothing else, should be strong enough to pull her to the door. Paul ought to be ashamed, letting a member of his own family make horseplay for a bunch of crude punchers! Caesar was brutal and Warren would get thrown. He'd come limping to the house apologetically and Rhae would be superior. Well, whatever happened, she hoped it would soon be over.\nAnd it was. Almost before it had begun. From the first gleeful shout that announced the opening of the chute, there had been an ominous silence.\n352\nJanet went to the porch and saw them coming, a slow procession. Warren was hurt! Dead, perhaps. Nothing less could make desert men act like that.... No.... Warren was leading. The cowboys were carrying someone else. Someone almost as tall as Paul! Where was Paul? Of course! Paul had raced for a doctor. Caesar would take him to Mexican Hat in no time. Hosea Potsworth, the doctor was there.....\nThey were nearer now. She could see theThe man's nice... Long... Frame....\n\"Miss Janet, Juanee take you away!\"\n\"No! No!\" Janet threw off the Indian woman's protecting hands. \"It isn't Paul! Be quiet. Go to your twins, Juanee. I hear them crying.\"\n\"Paul.\" Janet said it softly as they carried him in. \"Paul,\" she said again. Warren Newsbaum came and stood beside her.\n\"They have gone for a doctor, Janet. He isn't dead.\"\nIt was the assurance Janet needed. \"Juanee! Juanee, come quickly.\"\nRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEMAY 1943\nIf Paul were not dead, then life could go on for her, too. \"We must keep him warm! Yes.... Thank you Warren.\"\nHours later Janet's body woke from a drugged sleep. Her mind had never left Paul; yet she was unable to get up and go to him. On the porch men were talking. She heard Paul's name.\n\"Just like Paul Morgan,\" a voice was saying. \"He had that black-hearted Caesar by the bit before the rest of us knew the tenderfoot was dragging. If I've ever seen a killer that stallion is one!\"\nYes. Janet had always known that. Caesar was one of the things she was afraid of. He had tried to stomp her once. Paul had almost killed him then. Paul wouldn't admit that Caesar was a killer because Paul was master. But she knew.... Others were talking:\n\"The tenderfoot's a right guy.... Feels to blame.... Mrs. Morgan ought to know....\"\nOught to know what? Janet sat up. She must go to Paul. But she must go quietly. There was the baby to think of, Paul's baby.\n(To be continued)\n\nPURPLE SAGE\nBy Lydia Hall\nRoses for the lovers, Star-bright skies o'erhead, Lilies, white and lovely, For someone who is dead.\nDaisies for the children, Happy in their play, And the sweet carnations For the mother gray.\nBut I love the sage brush More than all the rest: Rain-wet plumes of fragrance Purpling the west.\n\nAnnual Relief Society Magazine Subscription Report\nVera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer\nRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE representatives in stakes, wards, and missions have again achieved a notable record as indicated by the Magazine subscription report for the calendar year 1942. Largely through their efforts, the regular paid circulation of the Magazine was raised from 55,000 in 1941 to 57,000 in 1942.\nThe General Board of Relief Society is deeply grateful to the Relief Society Magazine representatives throughout the Church, to the local, stake, and mission Relief Society officers who have supported them in their efforts, and to the members of Relief Society who have recognized the worth of this periodical by subscribing for it.\nAgain this year the General Board is awarding a one-year free Magazine subscription to all local representatives who procured subscriptions equal to 75% of the ward or branch enrollment in Relief Society as of the end of 1942. A total of 382 Magazine representatives earned this award during 1942. This number of award winners is greater by 84 or 28 percent than the 298 winners in 1941. There were 52 more award winners in wards, and 32 more in mission branches.\nThe award winners are listed in the honor roll on the following pages together with the numerical and percentage record of their achievement. The list is arranged in alphabetical order according to stakes and missions. In those instances where the entire stake, mission district, or mission also achieved a record of 75% subscriptions in relation to Relief Society membership, the names of the supervisory Magazine representatives are also listed in the honor roll. Much credit is due these supervisory Magazine representatives for their work in directing and stimulating the local representatives and in collecting and compiling the annual Magazine subscription reports.\nFollowing are a few excerpts from letters received from stake and ward Magazine representatives expressing their pleasure in fulfilling this assignment:\nFrom a Stake \"Magazine\" Representative in Utah\nOur Magazine drive is now over and it would do you good to feel the fine spirit of the sisters who participated. They expressed themselves to me that they were very happy in meeting the women in their homes, as the women they had solicited had received them graciously and made them welcome. In checking up with them I think they have done a very good work especially considering war times.\nFrom a Ward \"Magazine\" Representative in Idaho\nIt has been an overwhelming joy and pleasure to me to place your wonderful Magazine in the homes of my friends and neighbors whom I love. I have taken the Magazine for a number of years and cannot even imagine what I could do without it. When I was asked to be your Magazine representative, I readily consented as I well knew what great value the subscribers would receive for only $1.00.... I am very much thrilled with my success as I desired to place a Magazine in every home in the ward and have done so with the exception of two and am still going to try and get them as they think they can take it later.... Some of these subscriptions are\nPage 353\n354\nfor young married women who will be unable to attend Relief Society meetings but are anxious to receive in their homes the wonderful messages the Magazine contains.\nFrom a Ward \"Magazine\" Representative in California\nAt present our enrollment is 83 and I have succeeded in getting 83 subscriptions, and hope to procure a few more. I have enjoyed the work immensely and the women have been so wonderful and cooperative that it has been a joy to do the work.\nRelief Society Magazine representatives and subscribers throughout the Church will be pleased to know that the General Board recently decided to maintain the yearly subscription price at $1.00 despite greatly increased costs of labor and materials due to the war. In order not to raise the subscription price, it will be necessary for the subscription lists to be maintained at the present new high circulation figure and increased if possible. The General Board feels\nRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEMAY 1943\nthat Relief Society members, officers, and Magazine representatives will give every possible support to the Magazine in order that its present high quality may be maintained without increasing the subscription price.\nThe General Board also acknowledges with great appreciation the extra service given by Magazine representatives during 1942 in securing advance orders for A Centenary of Relief Society issued during 1942 as a special feature of the centennial year of Relief Society. The thousands of advance paid orders obtained by Magazine representatives throughout the Church made it possible for this valuable, historical, and pictorial book to be issued at the low price of 50c per copy and to assure procurement of fine quality paper and other supplies for it prior to involvement of the United States in war and the resulting restrictions and advance in prices for materials and labor. \nHONOR ROLL\nStake or Mission\nWard or Branch\nEnrollment\nSubscriptions\n\nMagazine Representative\n\n\n\nNo.\nPct.\n\nAlberta\n| | Cardston Second | 85 | 69 | 81 | Garnet Bates | | | Hartley | 24 | 22 | 92 | Annie Orr | | | Pershing | 9 | 10 | 111 | Selma Sache |\nAlpine\n| | Highland | 42 | 57 | 136 | Louella Binns |\nAustralian\n| | Adelaide | 215 | 262 | 122 | Violet Cook | | | Brisbane | 11 | 17 | 155 | Gertrude Latter | | | Enmore | 36 | 40 | 111 | Paloona M.

            "content": "Messages from the Wives of the General Authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\nEIGHTY SIX years is a long time to live in this world, but I still have much to enjoy and much to profit by. I give my Heavenly Father all praise and all thanks for what He has given to me. When I sit and meditate and look into the future I know what I hope for will come from Him. My constant prayer is that my sisters, both in and out of the Church, may be sustained in these trying times and given the assurance that the schemes of men will never overcome the will of God. In His own due time all will come right.  Augusta Winters Grant (Mrs. Heber J. Grant)\nOUR Gospel offers such a wealth of blessings to its members, that to ask oneself the question which blessing has proved the most helpful would be a difficult one to answer. Looking back over my life, I feel I can sincerely say that the training I received in Relief Society work has proved the most useful to me. This embraces every phase of woman's life so necessary for the home and motherhood. The charity work gives spiritual uplift; each weekly lesson broadens her intellectually; the work day offers its members useful hints for the home. Thank God for this great organization.  Luacine Savage Clark (Mrs. J. Reuben Clark, Jr.)\nMY experience has taught me that a mother's control over a child is lost or gained during the first few years of its life. Many a young mother with a smattering of psychology, who thinks correction will ruin her children's will power, lets them follow their own desires whether wise or unwise. Proper guidance in youth will prevent undesirable tendencies and encourage confidences in later life. Wise direction is not arbitrary, but kind and firm. Children should follow their own desires so long as these desires do not prompt them to be destructive, do not impose upon others, or do not injure the children's characters.  Ray Riggs McKay (Mrs. David O. McKay)\nPage 365\n-JULY 1943\nSOME of the blessings for which I desire to be duly grateful are: good and faithful parents, a kind and affectionate husband, a comfortable and happy home, and a large family who are a credit to their forebears and to the Church. These I regard as some of the most choice fruits of the Gospel, more than compensation for a life of sacrifice and service to the Church and to mankind.  Alice Robinson Richards (Mrs. George F. Richards)\nAT the time of the organization of the Relief Society in March 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith said if the sisters would live up to their privileges, \"the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates.\" While the angels in heaven may not be seen, yet we may be sure they are associated with the sisters in the great work assigned to them by revelation, which is the work of angels of mercy to the afflicted and oppressed.  Jessie Evans Smith (Mrs. Joseph Fielding Smith)\n\"Let us do our work as well, Both the unseen and the seen: Make the house where Gods may dwell, Beautiful, entire, and clean.\"  \"The Builders,\" Longfellow  Irene Merrill Richards (Mrs. Stephen L Richards)\nFORTUNATE is the individual who has learned to seek the Lord in secret prayer, when hearts may be freely unburdened and solace and strength received. This is a precious privilege denied to no one. The Savior says: \"Enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\" (Matthew 6:6)  Amy Brown Lyman (Mrs. Richard R. Lyman)\nTHERE is one thought I am sure that gives joy to all who work actively in Relief Society: through this organization we are helping fulfill the righteous purposes of our Father regarding the welfare of His children on earth. It is not enough to love Him, for love may be passive; to make it real we must try to uplift our neighbors as well as ourselves. Relief Society gives us that opportunity.  Leah Dunford Widtsoe (Mrs. John A. Widtsoe)\n\"I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly.\" The Relief Society work adds a broad, deep understanding of these wonderful words of the Savior. This organization gives service which finds sweet expression in ministering to the sick, and providing means to clothe the poor, aid the sightless, and straighten the limbs of the crippled. Truly because of Christ's teachings life more abundantly has come to many souls.  Grace Pack Callis (Mrs. Charles A. Callis)\nI HAVE enjoyed my musical career as only one who really loves music could. But, if I were asked to exchange for fame my happy home life with my parents and later my beloved husband and our fine sons, I would not. There are only three worth-while things in life the Gospel and all it offers us here and hereafter, children, and our loved ones. To me, the so-called \"fine things of life\" are secondary.  Lucy Gates Bowen (Mrs. Albert E. Bowen)\nHOW glorious to be born a woman, although it is not an easy task to fill all the requirements of wife and mother! A woman must learn to take the bitter with the sweet and keep on smiling. To be blessed with children who are perfect in body and mind, to have them desirous of an education, to see them grow up to be good Latter-day Saints, and finally good American citizens is a direct answer to a mother's prayer.  Winnifred Saville Cannon (Mrs. Sylvester Q. Cannon)\nWIVES OF GENERAL AUTHORITIES 367\n-JULY 1943\nTO realize our greatest blessings as Church members, we must ever strive, with an eye single to the glory of God, for the goal of eternal life. The Master has shown us, by His example in overcoming all things, the way to this eternal goal. So likewise may we, if we are obedient to the laws of the Gospel, overcome all things and be granted a place in our Father's Kingdom.  Fern Tanner Lee (Mrs. Harold B. Lee)\nASSOCIATION with women in Relief Society strengthens and stimulates one to do and be her best. Perhaps this is because we all think of it as a unique society established by a prophet, and only our best thoughts and loftiest ideas are worthy of such a divinely inspired organization. I truly appreciate the opportunity of belonging to and working in the Relief Society.  Ida Jensen Romney (Mrs. Marion G. Romney)\nIN 1939, I saw the women of Europe accept war without enthusiasm, but with resolution and fortitude. Now American women face the same grim tragedy with equal courage. Women have always shared in war's heartache and sacrifice, but not in the great responsibility of keeping the peace. Surely we can contribute by educating our children to safeguard liberty and justice.  Fawn Brimhall McKay (Mrs. Thomas E. McKay)\nIN these perilous times it is a source of comfort to all Latter-day Saint women to feel the power of the Church, and to share in its blessings.  Edith Grant Young (Mrs. Clifford E. Young)\nMY life has been made full by the opportunities our Church has given me to serve my fellow man. I know that through obedience to the Gospel, happiness and success may be enjoyed by all. I am grateful for our Church and its leadership.  Florence Gay Smith (Mrs. Nicholas G. Smith)\nALL my life I have been greatly blessed. My parents were ever watchful to make sure I was safe and in good places. They provided me with opportunities for education and self-improvement. I have many dear friends who fill my life with joy. My husband and children make my life rich and full, far beyond what I deserve. I pray that I may live to be worthy of my blessings.  Ruth Pingree Smith (Wife of Patriarch Joseph F. Smith)\n\"Men pass away, but people abide. See that ye hold fast the heritage we leave you. Yea, and teach your children its value, that never in the coming centuries their hearts may fail them, or their hands grow weak. Hitherto, we have been too much afraid. Henceforth, we will fear only God.\" Sir Francis Drake.  Valeria Brinton Young (Mrs. Levi Edgar Young)\nRELIEF SOCIETY is a very necessary part of my life. My testimony is that it has made the lives of the Maoris, Hawaiian, Samoans, and Mexicans among whom I have lived, better. No woman can devote herself to Relief Society work without becoming more friendly, getting a better knowledge of the Gospel, learning how to be a better wife, mother, and citizen, and enriching her life in the world of literature.  Vilate Romney Ivins (Mrs. Antoine R. Ivins)\nWIVES OF GENERAL AUTHORITIES 369\n-JULY 1943\nI AM very happy to have this opportunity to express my appreciation of the Relief Society work as carried on by the women of our Church. My many years of intimate association with the good sisters of the Central States Mission has brought this organization close to my heart, and I say to all workers, \"God bless you in your endeavors to alleviate distress and to make happier and richer, the lives of women everywhere.\"  Charlotte Towles Bennion (Mrs. Samuel O. Bennion)\nMEMBERSHIP in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a precious privilege. In these days of fluctuating values, the way of life outlined by the principles and ordinances of the Gospel rises to new heights. When the weaknesses of man-made systems are so apparent, the strength and majesty of God's plan are more clearly revealed. To humbly and faithfully assist in forwarding that plan is the supreme desire of every true Latter-day Saint woman.  Rachel Grant Taylor (Mrs. John H. Taylor)\nIT is wonderful to be alive today! Truly there is much to harass the heart and mind of one, but the glory of God is evidenced everywhere. In my early childhood mother taught me the word of God. I still cherish the following from Deuteronomy: \"Be strong and of good courage, fear not nor be afraid; for the Lord thy God, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\"  Addie Eldredge Hardy (Mrs. Rufus K. Hardy)\nTHE women of this Church have always lived courageously in times of trouble. Their achievements, in face of unspeakable hardships, have become a symbol of heroic womanhood. Whether, in this present hour, we are mothers sorrowing in the absence of loved ones, or young mothers guiding our children in the early years of life, we must be, as were those before us, women of high character, abiding faith, and undeviating principle.  Alice Thornley Evans (Mrs. Richard L. Evans)\n\"The visions and blessings of old are returning And angels are coming to visit the earth.\"\nThe charter members of the Relief Society sang this hymn at their first meeting. Truly our sisters are angels of mercy, sharing, comforting, feeding the hungry, and caring for the sick and helpless. Their service has disseminated culture and made the world happier and better. It's a high privilege to be a member of the Relief Society. May the Lord continue to bless all members.  Ida Murdock Kirkham (Mrs. Oscar A. Kirkham)\nMY dear sisters: In your deep spirituality we see mirrored the beauty of Sarah, the strength of Hannah, and the purity of \"Mary of Old.\" \"Strength and honor are your clothing\" and your children \"rise up and call you blessed.\" You are finding peace and comfort in the promise of an angel, \"Nothing is impossible with the Lord\"; and you are replying in love and faith, \"My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in Jesus my Savior.\"  Ina Ashton Richards (Mrs. LeGrand Richards)\nMY Recipe for Happiness: Cupfuls of thoughtfulness, a good measure of humility, A sprinkling of sunshine, a pinch of good humor, Stir well with self-forgetfulness; season with intelligence and understanding; Warm thoroughly with the spirit of the Gospel; share with generous portions to all.  Rae Jeremy Ashton (Mrs. Marvin O. Ashton)\nOPPORTUNITIES that come from the privilege of being a member of this Church bring happiness and development. Everyone can work, regardless of time, ability, or inclinations. I always want to remember that our real objective in this life is to so progress and develop that we may win eternal life in the Celestial Kingdom of our Heavenly Father. Sincere activity in the Church will help us accomplish this to our blessing and satisfaction.  Madeline Bitner Wirthlin (Mrs. Joseph L. Wirthlin)\nWIVES OF GENERAL AUTHORITIES 371\nThe \"Mormon\" Woman\nElder John A. Widtsoe Member of the Council of the Twelve\n\"WITHOUT the wonderful work of the women, I realize that the Church would have been a failure.\" So President Heber J. Grant has declared. (Gospel Standards, p. 150.) And, Paul the Apostle, speaking in an earlier day said that \"neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.\" (I Corinthians 11:11.) This notable statement implies that woman has done her work well; that she bears joint responsibility with the man in establishing the Kingdom of God; and, that the work will fail unless both do their duty.\nIn conformity with this doctrine, full equality has been provided in the Church between man and woman. They are equal in opportunity, privilege, and rights. They have a common destiny, which as free agents they may attain or lose through their own actions. This makes individuals of man and woman persons with the right of free agency, with the power of individual decision, with individual opportunity of everlasting joy for whom all the ordinances of the Gospel are available alike, and whose own actions throughout the eternities, with the loving aid of the Father, will determine individual achievement.\nThere can be no question in the Church about man's rights versus woman's rights. They have the same rights. The restored Gospel has brushed\nPage 372\naside the age-old controversy over woman's rights. It has refused to fetter woman and make her, as in the past, little more than man's goods and chattels. It has given her full rights of suffrage and property ownership. It recognizes her equal mental powers with those of man; and her right to use her inborn talents to the full. It has placed her by the side of man, not behind him, nor in front of him, thus certifying to her complete emancipation, without limitation, from unlawful subjection. She has been made to understand that the Lord loves His daughters as completely as His sons, and the promised blessings are the same for both.\nThis equality does not ignore the natural differences between man and woman. Woman is the child bearer and child rearer. To this glorious function she gives a large part of her life. The man is the provider of the necessities and comforts of the family. This does not reduce woman to a dependent. Freed from family and household cares, she could as well probably earn the living for the family. It is rather a cooperative enterprise based upon a divinely ordained division of labor for forming, maintaining, and protecting the unit of society, known as the family. Husband and wife who conform to natural law and beget and rear children are performing labors of equal importance. Each gains both freedom and power from such family life. One\nTHE \"MORMON\" WOMAN\ncannot look down upon the other. Both have the right as time and strength permit to exercise their talents as they may desire. Whenever these natural functions are set aside, frustration and defeat in life follow.\nThe wise recognition of the functional differences between husband and wife appears in the use of the Priesthood. The family must have organization. The man with his larger freedom to move about, is by divine decree the head or presiding officer or spokesman of the family. To him is committed the Priesthood, of fundamental need in Gospel life. But the benefits and blessings of the Priesthood thus conferred are shared by the wife and, as needed, by every member of the family. Indeed, Priesthood is first for the family, then for others if the man be called into official service. There is no lack of equality there; it is a manner of organization. The possession of the Priesthood does not indicate in any sense that man is superior to woman, but that he has a specific calling in Church government of which woman is relieved.\nIn the ordinances of the Priesthood man and woman share alike. The temple doors are open to every faithful member of the Church. And, it is to be noted that the highest blessings therein available are only conferred upon a man and a woman, husband and wife, jointly. Neither can receive them alone. In the Church of Christ, woman is not an adjunct to, but an equal partner with man.\nThe men of the Church have understood and respected the appointed place of woman in the plan of human salvation. That is much to their credit. They who have been and\n373\nare blinded by ancient traditions are few in number. In the Mormon community woman is free and honored. If she accepts gladly the glorious gift of motherhood, she may use whatever time and strength remain in the exercise of her talents as she may desire. She is placed under no limitations. Instead she is encouraged to use her available time in useful pursuits comporting with her natural gifts, her native endowment. The privilege of self-expression belongs to her as to all. She may enter industry, education, the professions, every worth-while pursuit, with the good will of all. And, because of her responsibilities as a rearer of the coming race, she should be carefully, widely, and wisely trained for this important part of her mission in life.\nTHE women of Mormonism have shown themselves worthy of this equality. They have accepted the responsibilities as well as the joys of individual freedom. Side by side with their husbands they have built the Kingdom of God. It has been a joint, a cooperative effort. President Grant spoke truly in his praise of woman's work in behalf of the restored Gospel.\nIn the toilsome building of the Church, in the face of unspeakable persecution and hardship, woman did not flinch. She met the required sacrifices with a courage born of sublime faith. She looked heavenward when the husband was bowed down in apparent defeat. She brought heaven down to earth, and the family went on with renewed assurance of victory. This she did though confined with children and household\n374\ncares, without the exhilaration of man's battle in the open field.\nThe story of the sacrifices of the Church is yet to be told. Perhaps it beggars the pen. But one thing may be said: Woman faced the tribulations without hesitation; and perhaps she accepted the heavier part. She met with high-flung disdain the horrors of the Missouri persecutions. She crossed the frozen Missouri towards the unknown wilderness without looking back at her happy Nauvoo home from which she had been driven. On the westward trail, sheltered thinly in a wagon box from the raging blizzard, she bore her children. She toiled undismayed across the dreary desert to find a hoped-for safe haven in distant mountain valleys. With tearful eyes, but with an unquenchable faith in the unfolding of God's eternal plan, she saw her child or husband laid away in a soon-to-be obliterated grave by the desert trail. With uncomplaining fortitude she shouldered her part of the burden of conquering the wilderness, of making the desert blossom as the rose. It was she who planted flowers around the log or adobe hut, which as they blossomed, lifted the souls of a driven but unconquered people, to whom beauty was a part of their faith.\nNor was the pioneer woman the only one who sacrificed. Many a woman elsewhere recognized the sweet voice of the Gospel, and because of her faith was driven from homes and loved ones. With a longing akin to agony in her faraway mountain home to which she had gathered, she awaited the word of love, which never came, from father and mother, brother and sister, who-JULY 1943\ncould not, or would not see the truth. But, in the midst of tribulation there was a singing within her heart, for she had found the truth."

She has gone out by the thousands as a bearer of the good tidings. Or she has remained to care for home and family, often to provide the actual support, while her husband and sons were abroad, perhaps in foreign lands, as unpaid ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ. She toiled, she went without, she loved truth so well that she was not afraid. The heroic of the Mormon woman, when told, will be an epic of human devotion.\nSuch service has not ended. Men go on missions today, leaving their families for years. Nearly all the Priesthood bearers give liberally of their time in Church service. While they do so, their wives not only carry on the work of the households, but are deprived of the companionship of their husbands. The wives of the General Authorities, who are honored in this issue of the Magazine, are excellent examples of this type of sacrifice. Almost every week end, and often for weeks at a time, their husbands are away on Church service, while the wives maintain lonely vigil in their homes. The same may be said of the wives of stake presidencies, high councilors, bishoprics, in fact of all officials of the Church. And, let it not be forgotten that the Mormon woman, by the tens of thousands, while bearing children and caring for their households, help\nTHE \"MORMON\" WOMAN\ncarry forward the various auxiliary organizations of the Church.\nThe Mormon woman has not forgotten the dead. For them she does vicarious work in the temples. She has there set an example to the man. The available names of dead females are few, while hundreds of thousands of names of dead males are awaiting help from the bearers of the Priesthood. Such service is not forgotten on the other side; but appears in blessings among the living.\nThus, wherever we touch the life of the Mormon woman, she is found in service, giving unselfishly of herself for the establishment of the Kingdom of God. Above all, however, is her service in keeping alive the flame of faith in the souls of her\n375\nhousehold. Divinely commissioned, in her keeping are the choice spirits who have come to earth to win an earthly body. In her hands lies the future of the race.\nThe mother's teachings outlast the storms of life. Her testimony is never forgotten. The current of faith and devotion and readiness to serve flows from her loving, courageous, unfaltering soul. \"Motherhood is near to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind.\" (Message of the First Presidency, October 1942.)\nCertainly, woman shall walk by the side of the man, for they two together shall solve the problems of eternity; they shall carry forward, endlessly, the purposes of the Almighty Father."

Summer sun Poured down upon their empire-to-be-won  The parched and sage-cloaked valley land ahead.\nOn sunflower-hearts the droning wild bees fed. The redmen's cricket harvest had begun. As if to mock the Leader's benison, The salt lake laughed in its imprisoned bed.\nThey made their final camp, with prayer and song; Soon fragrant brush-smoke rose in spirals high Like signal-fires of faith, to call the strong.\nBefore that night's first stars shone in the sky, Their plows had challenged the reluctant loam, Their furrows marked this virgin land as \"home.\"\nRelationship of the Y. W. M. I. A. To the Relief Society\nLucy Grant Cannon President of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association\nTHE mention of the name Relief Society immediately calls up in the mind of the Mutual Improvement officer or girl a band of motherly, intelligent women women who think of their personal welfare and comfort as secondary to the call of their duty in caring for the poor, the sick, the lonely, the unfortunate, the sad, the discouraged. Unselfish service is the keynote to their success. Truly they exemplify in life those meaningful words spoken of our Lord and recorded in the New Testament, \"He went about doing good.\"\nIt is not possible to express adequately the admiration and love which is felt by us as members of the Y. W. M. I. A., we who are intimately acquainted with the marvelous accomplishments of the Relief Society throughout the world. We salute you, our mother organization, and wish in every way to help you in the spreading of the gospel of love and service.\nWhen the Prophet Joseph Smith organized the sisters in 1842, he opened the way for all women in this last dispensation to make rapid advancement educationally and spiritually. Your one hundred years of noble achievement testify of the inspiration of the Prophet and of the magnitude of your calling.\nThe Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association is approaching\nPage 376\nits 74th milestone, for it was on November 28, 1869, that President Brigham Young, in his home in the Lion House, called together his young daughters and told them of their great responsibility as daughters of Zion. They were to set the example among the young in correct dress, simplicity in speech, and proper conduct. He laid special stress on the necessity of the study of the Gospel, telling his daughters to obtain a testimony of the same, as had their parents, directing them to active participation in the work of the Church, giving them that memorable instruction that \"more testimonies of the Gospel are gained on the feet than on the knees.\"\nFrom this small and unique beginning Mutuals were organized in practically all wards and branches until now the membership is around 78,000. As the years have passed, many new features have been added to this great movement. In 1923, an additional assignment of the supervision of the leisure-time activities for the entire Church was made by the First Presidency to the Mutual. These new assignments, these new features have but strengthened the original purpose and opened avenues of expression that have more firmly convinced the young that this work. (Continued on page 457)\nThe Relationship of the Relief Society to the Primary\nBy the late May Green Hinckley President of the Primary Association\nTHE relationship of the two organizations, the Relief Society and the Primary, is an intimate and mutual one. Their objectives are almost identical, for each centers in the home. No other organization is so helpful to the Primary Association as the organization whose membership is made up of the mothers of the Church.\nThe Relief Society organization has a program for helping the home builders of the Church, those whose responsibility it is to create the atmosphere and surroundings which mold the characters and fashion the lives of the boys and girls, the men and women of tomorrow. The moral progress of the world rests in a large measure in their hands.\nTo assist the mothers in the transcendent task of training the children is the assignment of the Primary Association. The declared objective of this association is to \"teach the children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord.\" To establish faith in God in their hearts, to teach them respect for the laws of God and of the nation, to teach them obedience to parents and to teachers, to turn their faces to the light of Heaven, and establish their feet in the paths of righteousness are all objectives found in the great work of the Primary Association.\nThe program of this organization brightens the home, strengthens the hands of the parents, and makes a vital contribution to the Church by teaching the everlasting Gospel to the children during their most impressionable years.\nEvery Latter-day Saint mother may look to the Primary organization for specific help with the religious attitude of her children. The four and five-year-old children are taught how to pray, and are helped in their understanding of God. Those who are six years old are given opportunities to show thankfulness and appreciation for God's blessings. For the seven-year-old boys and girls, a course is planned to help them to receive worthily the greatest of all treasures membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As a natural sequence, the eight-year-old children are taught the importance of their membership in the Church and are given the precious lessons from the Master as guideposts for them to follow. The nine, ten, and eleven-year-old children are taught lessons based on the Articles of Faith and are given opportunities to evaluate the principles in their everyday lives.\nIn addition to the basic religious teachings, the girls are given specific training in home building, a religious character-forming, leisure-time activity program which ties directly with the principles for home life as taught in the Relief Society. The boys of the same ages are given a similar program in trail building. In each group a cooperative plan of training intro-\nPage 377\nduces the children to arts and crafts, music, drama, games and play, nature lore and woodcraft, and many other allied arts. Every child who is helped to finish his course in Primary is well equipped with the tools for home, state, and Church citizenship.\nThus, what Relief Society members work for in the adult program, the Primary works for in the child program. Most Primary teachers are members of the Relief Society. They understand and appreciate what the Primary is doing for children.\nWe have not words to express our gratitude to the Relief Society for its cooperation and support. The records of the Primary will show that where the mothers are active in the Relief Society their children are active in the Primary and faithful in their Church duties.\nThe Primary Association will return with compound interest all the support and encouragement the parents can give to it. The Primary Association, with its 20,000 devoted teachers and officers, stands ready to help parents to teach the children of the Church lessons that will serve them throughout their lives.\nEvery effort should be made to have the Primary program fortify the home and reinforce the lessons which Relief Society mothers are teaching in all Latter-day Saint homes. Every effort should be made to strengthen the ties that bind the Primary to the Relief Society."

I would pamper myself with books in bright bindings, with music in its richest splendor, and with paintings, architecture, and sculptures in their most exalted forms. I would marvel not only at the great works in nature, the brilliant sun and the mysterious stars in the firmament, creations of God, the Father of all, but I would wonder also, and feel humble, before the ennobling treasures of beauty which inspired sons of God, geniuses among men, have left for all mankind to enjoy. Through the eyes and ears of these rare composers of beauty, I would see and hear at this very moment some small inkling of the beauties of a heaven which is to come. I would have some real reason for feeling that the works of God are marvelous and beyond human understanding, because even the works of some of His earthly sons are of no small glory and magnificence.\nNo doubt many a great man has been at a loss to account for the source of inspiration which empowered him to accomplish wonderful things; and many, if they were God-fearing men, have fallen upon their knees in prayers of thanks to Divine Providence for their natural endowments enabling them to bring knowledge and beauty into the world through their scholarship, art, or other useful endeavors.\nPage 380\nAmong musicians, there were at least two men who expressed themselves in words as to the mysterious source of their creations. When Handel had finished writing his oratorio, The Messiah, in the feverish haste of twenty-four days, he thought that the angels of heaven must have whispered the music into his ears, because he felt he could not of himself alone have written music of such power and grandeur. Those of us whose souls vibrate with the strains of Handel's music can well sympathize with the feelings in the heart of this great composer.\nRichard Wagner also felt that he was a privileged soul to be able to write masterpieces of supreme dramatic power. He, too, felt that he must have some unknown access to the harmonies of the spheres, because his works seemed to be of a greater stature, and of more splendor than of a mere man.\nHowever, it is my personal feeling that men of genius have greater powers within themselves than they may realize. I believe that God largely allows His earth children to follow their own divinely inherited intelligence in the working out of their problems and the creation of the beauties of their environments. The fact that Handel and Wagner were able to produce heretofore unheard of beauties is merely evidence that mortal man is of the spiritual lineage of Divine royalty. In other words, a child of God inherits some of the great creative powers of the Creator\nON ENLARGING THE SOUL WITH MUSIC\nHimself. The amazing genius of a human mind thus explains itself.\nWhat a privilege it is to become acquainted with the creations of the masters. It strengthens the tie between man and God. The immortality of the fruits of great minds is one of the choicest blessings bestowed upon mankind.\nGoethe, who was literally a fountain of genius, buried himself with the works of great minds, not only book literature and music literature, but paintings as well.\n\"If I were rich I would surround myself with the works of great men.\" We are living in an era when this statement may be changed to read as follows: \"Though I am poor, I can surround myself with the works of great men.\" Present-day advertising has made material goods so attractive that there has been a tendency to crowd out the enjoyment of the creations of great souls, the cherished treasures of all time. At this moment we are facing new circumstances. With world war devouring economic wealth, it would seem wise for us to seek the acquisition of non-material riches and beauties which cannot be taken away from us.\nPOOR people today can own a larger library of books than did wealthy readers of a century or more ago. What about music? Here we come to an entirely new development in our civilization, something rather startling and wonderful to experience. The modern phonograph with its recorded treasures offers an acquaintanceship with the symphonies of the greatest music creators of every period, performed by the skilled music interpreters of our day, and\n381\nbrought into our homes by one of the miracles of modern science. The phonograph is a tri-combination of phenomenal magnitude. Two centuries ago the royalty of Europe entertained itself with an abundance of good music. Prominent musicians of that day were engaged to perform, to compose, and to direct court orchestras, because music was as much a part of the daily routine as was the evening repast that preceded it. Crowned heads were as proud of the music offered in their courts as they were of any of their tangible possessions. 'This demand for music was a great stimulus to the musicians of that day and resulted in a flowering of the art of composition. It fanned the creative genius of Bach and Handel, of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. 'These men brought the art of music to a climax under the lavish patronage of European court life. 'This splendid heritage is no longer the exclusive property of an aristocracy, for it ls now conveniently available to anyone who cares to. Accept it. With the whole world in a most trying condition, music is like the north star, something we can trust and have faith in, something which has dropped to us as out of the blue of heaven to console and delight our hearts. But the reader may object that he is not inclined toward music which is of the grand manner. I believe with Shakespeare that every good child of God really has music in him, though it may not have been awakened. Several years ago a friend of mine was persuaded to attend his first symphony concert. He was not greatly interested, but a spark in him 382 was aroused so that today he is one of the most ardent enthusiasts on music that I know. He has discovered that real music is not composed of trivial tunes, but is something of genuine grandeur. Music has opened a new avenue of joy in his life. The phrase \"get acquainted with music, you might like it\" is an experiment that is almost certain to have a happy ending. We enjoy things and people and places that we know. The more we expand our interests, the more fully we partake of the God-given treasures that are a part of the design of our personal destiny and fulfillment. The first step in the understanding of music is exposure to it. We must hear it, we must become acquainted with it, we must learn to recognize it, then we will admire it, appreciate it, love it. The phonograph offers a most convenient and sure method for carrying out this formula. It makes possible frequent repetitions that will lead to the same familiarity with the classics that exists with the folk songs and popular melodies of childhood. We all love the tunes that are sung in community gatherings, the lullabys, the Christmas-JULY 1943 carols, the negro melodies. When we become equally well acquainted with the works of the masters of music, our ceiling of appreciation will rise and expand to heights that bring undreamed of joy. The Apostle Paul said, \"When I was a child, I spake as a child.\" Adults who have neglected the beauties of music literature are as children musically. Aristotle uttered a wise recommendation when he said, \"Let the young pursue their studies. In music until they are able to feel delight in noble melodies and thythms, and not merely in that common part of music in which every slave or child and even some animals find pleasure.\" After more than two thousand years, Aristotle's advice is still pertinent. If we seek after the ways of strong men, we partake of their virtues and nobleness. May music, the universal language, open up a new chapter of joy in our lives. Families who in former years were avid collectors of sets of books are now collecting albums of recorded music. Great music has quite as much aesthetic significance as volumes of \"belles-lettres.\" Suggested List of Recordings for Beginners 1. Dvorak: New World Symphony 2.

Rimsky-Korsakoff: Scheherazade Suite Agnes McMillan Bolto Edna J. Gardiner HE recent appointment of Agnes McMillan Bolto to the General Board brings to this group a member well qualified to fill her new assignment. Many years of continuous activity and service in the Relief Society of the Church have broadened the scope of her endeavors and endeared her to the people among whom she has served. Her life and character reflect her Scotch-English parentage. Her father, William McMillan, was of Scotch extraction, although he was born in England of Latter-day Saint parentage. Faith in God and His people inspired the McMillans to come to Utah. They made their home in the Twenty-second Ward of Salt Lake City and when the Twenty-second Ward was divided and the Twentyeighth Ward created, Brother McMillan became the first bishop of the Twenty-eighth Ward, presiding over it for twenty-three years. His wise counsel endeared him to his people and was a source of inspiration and guidance to his children. He was politically active and served three terms in the state legislature, holding positions of importance and authority for many years. Sister Bolto's mother, the daughter of Benjamin Smith Newton, of Newcastle, England, was a homemaker, presiding with dignity and justice in the affairs of home life. She was a devoted wife and mother, sustaining her husband in his public duties. She gave diligent and faithful AGNES M. BOLTO service in the Relief Society, particularly in welfare work. She was known and loved for acts of kindness among the sick and needy, serving for days at a time during epidemics. Agnes McMillan Bolto, the fourth child, was born in Salt Lake City, September 27th, 1887. Her early training in a home influenced strongly by religious precept and example, has greatly augmented her naturally spiritual temperament. Her activity in the Church began at the age of fourteen, as secretary of the ward Primary. When only seventeen, she was set apart as an ordinance worker in the Salt Lake Temple, acting in this capacity for ten years. Page 383 384 She was a member of the Tabernacle choir, under both Evan Stephens and Anthony C. Lund, contributing freely of her musical talent in solo work as well as group singing. Professor Stephens accorded her the distinction of being the foremost contralto in Utah. She accompanied the choir on its northwest tour in 1909, and later, with her husband, George F'. Bolto, went with the choir to New York. Being called to sing in the Temple choir by Prof. J. C. Thomas, she was often selected to sing duets with President Heber J. Grant. Those were happy years, endowing her richly with spirituality and contributing to her training. She was united in marriage to George F. Bolto in 1910, and they made their home in the Third Ward in Salt Lake City, where Sister Bolto faithfully participated in ward activities. She presided over the Junior Sunday School, was president of the Primary Association for three years, and was assistant choir leader. During this time she also organized, under the presidency of Lotta Paul Baxter, the first Relief Society chorus in Liberty Stake. In 1917, the Boltos moved to Richards Ward, Granite Stake, in Salt Lake City, where she continued to participate actively in Church work, serving first as secretary of the Relief Society and later as stake chorister, under Sister Leonora T. Harrington. She attended the first course in family welfare work conducted by the General Board at the Brigham Young University in 1920 under the leadership of Amy Brown Lyman. Later she served for six months as a field worker of the social]-JULY 1943 welfare department of the Relief Society General Board. Sister Bolto was later called to the Granite Stake Relief Society Board, where she served as second and, subsequently, as first counselor to Sister Emmaretta G. Brown, giving untiring and valuable service for about eight years, when home duties claimed her entire attention. After a short respite she was again called to active service outside her home, being elected president of the Forest School Parent-Teacher Association. Her work here was of pronounced value to the school and the community. During this time she was also chorister of the ward Relief Society. Sister Bolto was appointed second counselor to Myrtle B. Latimer in the Ganite Stake Relief Society, and in 1938 succeeded her as president, which position she held at the time of her call to the General Board. The home life of Brother and Sister Bolto was ideal. Brother Bolto died January 25, 1943. Their two children, Milan and Frances, arenow married; Milan is in the military service of his country. Agnes Bolto's appointment to the Relief Society General Board, May 5, 1943, brings to this Board a woman of dignity and poise, endowed with spirituality, with a loyal trust in the Priesthood and its salutary influence on the lives of the women of the Church. Wise in the choice of friends and associates, she has presided with dignity, justice, and understanding, and approaches her new position with humility and trust in the Lord. Steps in the Development of Our Flag The first flag of the United States, known as the Cambridge flag, was raised by George Washington at Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 2, 1776. The union was the combined crosses of St. George and St. Andrew. In August 1777, this flag was raised by Captain Abraham Swarthwout at Fort Schuyler. President Washington approved, January 13, 1794, this flag consisting of fifteen stars and stripes, Vermont and Kentucky having been admitted to the Union. In 1818, Congress enacted that the thirteen stripes, denoting the thirteen original colonies, be restored, and a star added to the blue canton for each state after its admission to the Union. The present flag consists of thirteen stripes with a blue canton bearing fortyeight stars, one for each state in the Union. Page 385 The Story of Old Glory Mabel Harmer ECAUSE it is the symbol of home, country, liberty, and all else that we hold most dear, \"Old. Glory\" commands our sincerest reverence, claims our deepest love, and inspires our greatest acts of courage. Nations have unfurled their flags since the beginnings of recorded history, and legions have followed their ensigns to greater deeds of courage and valor. \"Terrible as an army with banners,\" said King Solomon over three thousand years ago. The Star-spangled Banner has a diversified and fascinating history and it is particularly fitting at this time, when the flag is so prominent in our national spotlight, that we learn more of its history. Many flags, both of this and other nations, flew over this land before the stars and stripes, as we know it today, was finally adopted. Columbus unfurled the colorful banner of Spain when he landed on the island of San Salvador in 1492. The orange, white, and blue flag of the Dutch Republic flew over the colony of New Netherland for fifty years, until an English fleet replaced it in 1664 with the cross of St. George and gave the colony the name of New York. In 1535, Jacques Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence and formally claimed its entire valley in the name of the King of France. When James of Scotland succeeded Queen Elizabeth on the English throne, he created the Union flag by - uniting the red cross of St. George on its field of white with the white cross of Scotland's St. Andrew on Page 386 its field of blue, and it was this flag that waved over the struggling colonies of Jamestown and Plymouth. Not only was it the first flag to fly over the homes of English-speaking people in America, but its colors of red, white, and blue lived on to become the permanent colors of the flag of the United States. It was the Union flag that led Washington's struggling army of Virginians to battle at Fort Necessity in 1754, it waved above the successful colonists in the defeat of Braddock, and it replaced the flag of France at Detroit in 1760. Although the Union flag was the chief standard of the American colonists for a great many years, they soon began to create individual flags expressive of their particular localities and interests. Among the best known of these was the pine tree flag of Massachusetts, which towards the close of the colonial period became known as the \"Liberty Tree\" and bore the legend \"An Appeal to Heaven.\" Another symbol which was employed in a variety of design in New England was the rattlesnake flag with the warning words, \"Don't Tread On Me.\" New York fashioned a flag with a black beaver on a white background, and Rhode Island's white flag had the word \"Hope\" above a blue anchor. There was no common standard furled over the heads of the fighting colonists when the fires of the Revolutionary War flared into full blaze. As one historian says, \"The only common flag the Colonists had was the one they were fighting against,\" THE STORY OF OLD GLORY but among the many banners that floated over the various companies were a number that could easily have been forerunners in design for our present stars and stripes. Among these was the flag of the Philadelphia Light Horse Troop which escorted General Washington to New York to assume command of the army and which bore in its center a knot tied with thirteen cords flanked by thirteen blue and silver stripes. The first flag to be generally adopted by the united colonists was known as the Grand Union flag and was flown from a seventy-six-foot flagstaff on Prospect Hill in Somerville, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1776. It is not known who designed the flag but, oddly enough, it contained the Union Jack of the mother country in the canton together with the thirteen red and white stripes still used in our national banner. It continued in use until nearly a year after the signing of the Declaration of Independence when it was superseded by the stars and stripes. ITH the signing of the Declaration of Independence, all allegiance to Britain was broken and the symbolic crosses of the Grand Union flag became obsolete. Nevertheless, Congress was painstakingly slow in proceeding to create a new flag. It was not until June 14, 1777 that Congress, convened at Philadelphia, in the midst of numerous items of petty business passed the simple resolution, \".... That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\". Thus without fanfare 387 or ostentation the stars and stripes was born. Just as the Great Union flag had been created by the simple procedure of adding six white stripes to the field of England's flag, the new national banner was made by substituting the thirteen white stars on a field of blue for the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew. In this manner the union of the thirteen colonies was doubly portrayed, both by the stars and the stripes. 'There was no definite design provided at this time, and the matter of what proportions the field should be, or how the stars should be arranged was left entirely up to the fancy of the seamstresses who fashioned the various flags. Dr. M. M. Quaife in his book The Flag of the United States says, \"We seek in vain for any recorded explanation of this cavalier procedure but it seems obvious that the reverence which all Americans today pay to their flag was foreign to the minds of the men of 1777. A flag was essential to the conduct of warfare between ships at sea, and the Congress met the need by prescribing in general terms the new design. It is obvious that their actions were animated by the practical need and but slightly, if at all, by sentiment for the new banner; nor need we wonder at this, for in the beginning it was not hallowed by the associations and the sacrifices of more than a century and a half which all present-day Americans instinctively associate with it.\" Congress in adopting the emblem had assumed that there would be only thirteen permanent states. Rapid expansion to the west and south soon brought about a national change 388 of mind in this regard, however, and in 1781 Congress adopted a resolution pledging that new states would be admitted to the Union enjoying equal privileges with the original ones. Vermont and Kentucky were already well settled and when they became the 14th and isth states of the Union, it was soon apparent that something had to be done about the flag. In 1793 a resolution was presented to Congress suggesting that the flag be changed to contain fifteen stars and fifteen stripes and the Senate nonchalantly passed the bill; but the House arose in indignant debate and one member \"thought it a trifling business which ought not to engross the attention of the House when it was their duty to discuss matters of infinitely greater importance.\" He said, \"If we are to alter the flag from thirteen to fifteen stripes with two additionel stars because Vermont and Kentucky have been added, we may go on add-. Ing and altering at this rate for one. Hundred years to come. It is likely that before fifteen years shall elapse we Shall consist of 20 states. The flag ought to be permanent.\" After considerable _ bickering wherein the members of the House freely expressed themselves that the bill was not worth all the trouble and waste of time it was causing, they passed the bill, in order to get rid of it; and thus the second flag of the United States became one of fifteen ted and white stripes. - It was our national banner for nearly a quarter of a century, led our soldiers through three wars, and flew over Fort McHenry on the night of September 13-14, 1814 when Francis Scott Key-JULY 1943 watched through the rockets' red glare to learn the fate of the Starspangled Banner. This lack of regard for or even interest in the flag can be understood when it is remembered that as yet we were not a strong nation bound by ties of loyalty and tradition. We were but a group of struggling and loosely-bound states far more concerned about individual governments than about the nation as a whole. In the same manner our national anthem attracted but little interest when it first appeared in print, and it was not until the time of the Civil War that it began to attain its present place in the affection of the American people. After the war of 1812 there was a considerable improvement in the unity of feeling existing between the states and a tremendous upsurge in our sense of national pride. By 1816 there were five additional states in the Union but no provisions had been made for displaying this increase in the commonwealth upon the flag. The matter was brought up in Congress by Peter H. Wendover and it was largely due to his persistent efforts, over a period of two years, that a permanent design for the flag was finally adopted. Members of Congress argued that it was impractical to add additional | stripes for each new state and that the number should be reverted back to the original thirteen stars and stripes. As everyone knows, a compromise was finally effected, in 1818, whereby the number of stripes was placed at thirteen for the original colonies while a new star was added for each new state until forty-eight (Continued on page 392) Short-story Writing Pearl Spencer Department of English, Logan Senior High School WHEN is a short story not a short story, but a sketch, a tale, or an incident? 'This is the question which many an aspiring author ruefully asks herself as her lovingly-wrought manuscript comes back with a kindly note praising the spirit, perhaps the style, but pointing out that it doesn't quite qualify as a short story. The question is particularly difficult to answer in view of the fact that many modern writers, inspired by Chekhov and moved by an increasing interest in social conditions rather than the individual, have written memorable stories which have certainly not followed the rules laid down by Poe, and which seem to some readers not to be short stories at all. But re-examination of the great pieces of short fiction in the modern manner will show that they possess the central purpose and discernment that provide the one essential feature of the short story  unity. Assuming unity to be the necessary element of the short story, it can be seen that the followers of the Russian writers are not so much at variance with Poe's standards as many readers have thought. The difference, after all, seems chiefly one of technique, not of intent. For Poe's great purpose, you will remember, was to create a single, strong, emotional expression on his readers. He laid down the rules by which, it seemed to him, such an impression might best be made. If other methods can do the same, he would probably be the last to object. He would also agree that too many of his followers had become mechanics rather than artists, and that new ways of writing might give new life to the craft. Just as these literary mechanics, turning out vast numbers of short stories with \"interchangeable parts,\" as one critic phrased it, discredited Poe's formula among some writers, so it is the second-rate writers, without genuine purpose or literary discipline, who have given the modern short story the reputation of being formless. As a result, many of us have the idea that we may describe our eccentric neighbor's vagaries or the desolate family camped beside the highway, and call the result a short story. The essential unity of the short story is achieved by the selection of _a struggle in which the characters of the story are engaged, and in picturing or predicting the outcome of this struggle. The struggle may be man (or woman) against the perils of intrigue, the elements, war, or enemies  and we have the adventure story; against his rivals the love story; against his material handicaps the success story; his weaknesses the moral story; the universe the religious story; his personality the psychological story; his environment  the story of social consciousness. This last, especially, has widely extended Page 389 390 the conception of what constitutes a dramatic struggle. Whatever the theme and method a writer chooses, it is his treatment of this struggle that determines the unity of his story. Its significance must be shown. It must be followed to an inevitable, clear-eyed conclusion. Accident and coincidence may hasten or precipitate the conclusion, we are told, but they must not determine it. That must be inherent in the characters and circumstances. And it is well to remember that it is not the unique situation or the dramatic denouement that brings a readerback to certain stories time and time again. It is the way in which the struggle unfolds that makes some stories immortal; that magic by which they still keep us tingling with suspense even after we know them almost by heart. This matter of resolving the conflict and getting everything ended neatly and satisfactorily is not so difficult if one chooses a struggle where the outcome is a matter of a lifetime of happiness or unhappiness, and the issues are clearly defined and capable of solution. Writing then becomes chiefly a matter of working tremendously hard to carry the reader along, in rapt attention, toward the end of the struggle, the solution of the plot. But what of the minor dramas that the sensitive participants in life see about them every day? What of those struggles whose very poignancy lies in their being unending? What of the heroism that is all the greater for being unheralded and unsung? What of those daily choices we make, no one of which is in itself of decisive importance, but which-JULY 1943 add up inevitably to our destinies? Are these not the stuff of literature also? They are indeed, and they are a rich source of material for the beginning writer, not only because we can interpret best the things we know and love, but for the very practical reason that there is a great interest in such material at the present time. If the interest is waning, as it may be, the only ones to blame are the writers who have surfeited us with formless uninterpreted, usually gloomy sketches in the name of the \"new\" short story. For, first of all, such material must be given form. If the nature of a man's life is to be revealed, and his never-ending, but brave struggle with poverty is to be shown, then certain incidents, complete in themselves, must be carefully chosen and highlighted. Second, the significance of these events must be made clear. It has been pointed out that the writer of a short story can't develop his characters as completely as a novelist does, but that he has to know them just as well in order to reveal them by lightning flashes, as it were. Too many writers of the \"slice of life' school don't know their characters any better than any casual observer might, and reveal no more of the significance of their lives. Somerset Maugham warns us that whenever a story has no more significance than a recital of facts, the danger point has been reached. Third, the occurrences which one chooses must illumine the past and predict the future inexorably. This requirement is imposed upon the writer of this kind of story even more sternly than upon the author who SHORT-STORY WRITING creates'a more formal plot within whose outline the story has its being. The choice of incident must, in a brief space, add up in effect to a lifetime. Read Dorothy Parker's \"Clothe the Naked\" as an example of this kind of story. The writer of the story which does not rely upon a decisive climax and outcome, usually imposes a fourth obligation upon himself. Very often such a story becomes compelling only as it is felt to be somehow typical of large numbers of the same sort of people. Much of the reader's pleasure comes from his sense of recognition. Every writer, as Miss Edith Ronald Mirrielees points out, needs the capacity for \"making the story's figures stand clear as individuals and yet cast shadows larger than the individual.\" 'This capacity is particularly essential in the story whose characters interest and appeal because they are typical rather than individual. PROBABLY nothing could do the cause of the pioneer story* more good than for numerous writers to turn with determination to strongly plotted stories with gripping situations, authentic personal struggles, and dramatic, triumphant climaxes. Such stories would be fit vehicles to reveal the noble, dignified, yet intensely human pioneer men and women (particularly the women), who so seldom have been adequately dealt with in the short story. Weare not obligated to show the epic significance of the entire pioneer 391 trek everytime we write of pioneer life as so many have seemed to feel. But we are obligated, whenever we write a short story of pioneer days, to produce a firm narrative with an honestly defined struggle. It should be a story that will stand on its own feet and create a response in the reader, rather than depending upon his already established responses to make it effective. 'This rather lazy dependence upon the sympathetic attitude of the reader has made too many of our pioneer stories lack appeal for \"outsiders\" or our own members to whom the sight of a handcart, for example, does not bring the strong emotional response that it does in most of us. No greater service could be done our young people than to provide them with stirring, genuinely moving fiction which would help create an understanding attitude toward the pioneers. Instead, much of our fiction assumes that such an admiring, understanding, and reverent attitude already exists, and the symbols of pioneer life the handcart, the _ trail-side grave will in themselves give a story emotional power. They are genuinely meaningful symbols, and our grandfathers' diaries are full of enough characters and situations, color and meaning, to provide grist for our mills for as long as Daniel Boone has done, but it's our task to give them new form, new life, and new meaning for a new generation. Because such a wealth of source material on pioneer days exists, many people have assumed that pioneer *Special instruction is given in this article on the writing of pioneer stories because a need is recognized for direction in this type of short-story writing. The General Board does not, in any way, desire to encourage the writing of pioneer stories more than other types of fiction. 392 stories should be easy to write. Writers know that they are not. A satisfactory, clearly defined struggle is hard to set up in a pioneer story, save in matters of hardships and privation; for the united struggle of the pioneers against their common protagonists always seems more characteristic than their individual struggles and problems. It is hard not to blur the unity with too much explanation. It is difficult not to intrude a moral instead of letting the characters convey their own message. We are not allowed the same range in satisfactory endings; therefore we must often work much harder to create suspense and charm in the way in which the story progresses to its conclusion. Because we are truly 'a peculiar people,\" we are even more false in our premises than most historical writers if we assume the plausible untruth that \"people have always been the same\" and interpret the pioneer sense of values accordingly. The premises upon which their sense of values were built are difficult to explain and difficult-JULY 1943 to take for granted as motivations. We have to be especially careful, as we try to appeal to the present generation, not to lose contact with the real spirit and real thinking of the pioneers. 'This requires constant, intimate, understanding contact with original source material. How impossible it is to interpret the pioneers without having imbibed deeply of their spirit and convictions is illustrated by the many scholarly and factually accurate studies which are still entirely false and valueless as interpretations of their lives. For any story of plot, Poe's formula is still the best in the world, and every writer, of course, knows his analysis by heart. Certainly no one can safely diverge from it until his sense of form is sure. Somerset Maugham sums Poe up thus: \"It [the short story] is a piece of fiction, dealing with a single incident, material or spiritual, that can be read at a sitting; it is original, it must sparkle, excite, or impress, and it must have unity of effect or impression. It should move in an even line from its exposition to its close.\" THE STORY OF OLD GLORY (Continued from page 388) in all blazed forth upon the blue field. In December 1942 by Act of Congress, a slight change was made in the manner of presenting the pledge to the flag. In place of extending the arm, as formerly, the hand now remains over the heart during the entire time that the pledge is repeated, and is not dropped until after the final word \"all.\" Bibliography Quaife, M.

FAT SALVAGE PROGRAM RESULTS to date of the Fat Salvage program to obtain glycerine for wartime purposes. Confirm that the methods originally set up were sound and that the plan has been functioning on an effective basis. The present problem is one of impressing a larger percentage of American housewives with the importance of saving and turning in their waste household fats and greases. A consumer study made by the Office of War Information in January 1943, shows that while 92 per cent of housewives are familiar with the program and 74 per cent understand the procedures, to be followed, only 59 per cent were saving kitchen fats and only 31 per cent had actually turned them into their meat dealers. Are you one of the 31 per cent? Save Waste Fats Rush them to your meat dealer. ANNUAL RELIEF SOCIETY SHORT-STORY CONTEST 395 Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon MOST of the world's inhabitants hate war. Man's cupidity causes it. Man's stupidity permits it. All suffer its tragic consequences. Fortunately, however, some good comes of war. Like a refiner's fire, frequently it burns out the dross of human selfishness, leaving gold ingots of devotion, nobility, heroism. A task worthy of every woman's consecration is to carry into the post-war world virtues learned through today's vicissitudes, such as: the joy of having children (last year's birthrate in America doubled that of 1941, and this year's will be higher); the value of marriage and a home (half the girls in one war production plant admit they are hoping and saving for a home); the steadying power of physical work; the experiences of budgeting; the gratifications of practicing thrift; and the immense economy of cooperation, in home, community, national, and international life. War teaches us the comfort of faith in God; the necessity of human brotherhood; the fact that suffering can make us a little more God-like in comprehension. These are lessons to remember.

EDITORIAL VOL. 30 JUNE-JULY 1943 NOS. 6 and 7 To Our \"Father! to God Himself we cannot give a holier name.\"  Wordsworth TWO of the most hallowed words in any language are \"father\" and \"mother,\" and around these names are associated memories among the most precious of this life. Of late years it has become customary to pay special honor to our mothers on the second Sunday in May, and to our fathers on the third Sunday in June. Happy the child, the youth, and the man or woman to whom the word \"father\" recalls a series of recollections brimming with the loving care and kindness bestowed upon him by his father. To such a person, memory reaches back to earliest years and treasured childhood experiences. These will vary, but how often, perchance, will one of these incidents be centered about the bedside of the sick, as the family kneels in prayer and the father, exercising one of his greatest prerogatives as the bearer of the Holy Priesthood, invokes the healing power upon the sick. Mingled with such important and sacred memories will be ones of a lighter nature, ones in which the father figures as a veritable mine crammed full of pennies and nickels, a haven of last resort in crucial times of need. A trip taken with a father always remains a bright and cherished mem-  W ordsworth. Ory. It may have been to a large city where it seemed that all the alluring and enchanting sights and sounds in the world were spread out before one's wondering gaze. One such trip to New York is recalled. Each morning one was awakened by father standing in the doorway of the hotel bedroom and quoting, \"The bird of time has but a little way to fly and lo, the bird is on the wing.\" This reminder of the fast fleeting magic days worked as a charm! Associated with that special trip are recollections of a visit to the lower east side in order that a wholesome home might the better be appreciated; the wonders of the Hippodrome where the horses disappeared under the water; the magic of the Automat where one put in a nickel and food appeared in as wonderful a manner as any fairy tale; luncheon at the Astor with Hazel Dawn; and two trips to the Metropolitan to watch with fascinated eyes the dancing of Nijinski and the Russian Ballet. Golden pages from the book of memory of a father's kindness and generosity! Another happy recollection of a holiday spent with father is of a mountain camping trip which remains a vivid picture for two reasons: first, for the discovery that father was a good cook; and second, a not-so-pleasant Poge 397 remembrance of flesh gained from eating his skillet-bread. As one grows older, one more and more becomes conscious of the watchful and constant care evidenced by a father as the guardian of his children. Pitfalls and dangers are pointed out and all one's friends and associates are closely scrutinized. One feels at times that his premonitions and insight are too acute to be comfortable, but gradually as one's outlook broadens, his wisdom is recognized and his advice is followed with a better grace. His justice and fairness stand out as prominent traits, and his encouragement and understanding are ever sources of strength. One comes to turn to him more and more for counsel and in following it, one's life takes on a righteous pattern. After marriage, when one's husband becomes the father of one's children, then the cycle is completed. In noting the tender, constant, and great love manifested by a young father toward his babies and young children, one's appreciation for fatherhood is increased, and thanksgiving to the Lord wells up in one's heart for fathers such as these fathers who will be our fathers not only here but throughout time and all eternity as well. M. C. S. Personal Letters Protest Picturizatoon of Smoking and Drinking THE following letter is an example of the excellent personal letters sent by Relief Society women to Mr. Will H. Hays of the nation's film industry, protesting the picturization of smoking and drinking. Such letters from individuals and Relief Societies were suggested by the General Board of Relief Society in The, page 45, as a follow up of the letter sent by the general presidencies and superintendencies of Church auxiliaries. Dear Mr. Hays: As a young mother and an American citizen interested in the welfare of our youth, I protest the great and unnecessary use of alcohol and tobacco in motion pictures. In addition to holding up before young people false standards and ideals, so much drinking and smoking by their heroes and heroines, I believe, represents the characters falsely. I refer specifically to such pictures as The Thin Man series wherein Nick Charles drinks incessantly, and continually puffs on a cigarette and yet always is up to solving the crime brilliantly. People I have known who drink and smoke to an extreme are not lovable individuals and are not worth two cents in an emergency. It is my sincere hope in writing you that action can be taken to eliminate an evil which has a far-reaching effect upon the lives of our young people. Yours very truly, (Signed) Mrs. Helen A. Perkes -JULY 1943 Tch! Tch! Grandma! Olive W. Burt O all outward appearances, this summer morning was just like all the others. The family sat crouched behind wide-spread newspapers, reaching out groping hands for buttered toast and orange slices. Grandma, alone in her little newspaper-walled world, found plenty to do, keeping food within reach of those bodiless hands. Yes, it did seem just like all other mornings. Breakfast over, the girls rose and stretched and moved into the living room. Judith turned on the radio and curled up in a big chair with a mystery story; Patty sat down and began to do her nails; their mother puttered about with the house plants, and their father dashed out of the house, in his usual rush to get to work. \"It's a lovely day, isn't it?\" Jessica asked without looking up from the _geranium from which she was plucking dried leaves. \"I think I'll try to get a few moments to knit on that afghan I've been doing for the Red Cross for the past six months.\" Grandma began to clear the table. In the wrinkled old face the blue eyes were alive and young with resentment. She had thought maybe today would be different. She had done what she could to change it, but apparently it was of no use to try. She scraped the dishes and piled them high in the sink. Dishes! Grandma's stomach contracted with distaste. How many millions of dishes had she done in her lifetime? She had begun wrong, she guessed, being born the youngest girl in a big family. Her first job had been to wash dishes while her older sisters did all the exciting things like making cakes and cookies and gingerbread, unrestrained in their efforts, because they knew Mary would have to do the dishes they stacked up. Then she had married, and there were dishes three times a day. Dishes and babies. There had been a half respite in the years after the children were grown and married, when Frank had been there to help her after every meal. Then he had gone on and she had come to live with Jessica, and do dishes. This was all they thought she was good for, all of them. Let her go for a visit to John's or to Joseph's or Agatha's, and the dishwasher took a vacation. The telephone rang. Book, nail polish, flowers scattered to the four winds as the family made a dash for the phone. Patty got there first. The inviting smile was wiped from her face as she dropped the receiver and said listlessly, \"It's for you, Grandma.\" Patty returned to her nails. Grandma came slowly to the telephone. She hoped the family wouldn't notice her eagerness. She picked her answers carefully, mostly monosyllables; \"Yes. Yes? Tomorrow? Yes. All right.\" She went back to the kitchen. The dishes were still distasteful, but Grandma wasn't thinking about them now. She turned on the water\nPage 399\n400\nand sprinkled the soap powder into it. It fluffed up. The phone rang again. \"It's for you again, Grandma!\" called Patty. The family wasn't curious yet, but if they had been they wouldn't have heard a great deal. The third time they had to call to her, though, they did listen, and when the fourth voice asked for Mrs. Sheldon there was frank impatience and curiosity in their faces. \"What is it, Mother?\" Jessica asked, but Grandma just said breezily, \"A little war work I'm trying to do.\" There was no use to try to pry further. If Grandma wanted to talk, nothing could stop her; but if she didn't want to talk, well, nothing could start her. Jessica was pretty sure it was some doubtful project, but she'd hear about it sooner or later. Grandma went into the kitchen, took off her apron and hung it up. Then, with pencil and notebook she sat down near the telephone. \"You aren't going to keep the phone all day, are you?\" asked Judith. \"I'm expecting a call.\" \"So am I!\" answered Grandma tartly. \"Your friends will have to take the same chance mine do.\" It must have been an hour later that Patty went into the kitchen for something. \"Why, Grandma!\" she cried, \"The dishes aren't done!\" \"Aren't they?\" asked Grandma sweetly. \"You know they're not!\" Patty was accusing.-JULY 1943\n\"I didn't know anything about it. I know I didn't do them,\" Grandma went out of the room and up the stairs. Jessica looked at her daughters. \"Something must be wrong with Grandma,\" she said. \"You girls better do the dishes this morning.\" It wasn't as simple as that, but the dishes were finally done. About that time Grandma came downstairs, hatted and coated, and stepping spryly along. \"Where are you going, Grandma?\" asked Jessica sharply. \"To work,\" said Grandma, and opened the door. Then she turned back. \"I am willing to pay for my board and room, Jessica, now that I've got a job that pays me,\" she said. \"Or I can go somewhere else to live if you'd rather. I've had two offers of a home this morning with pay! I didn't take them, but I can. I am going to work now, everyone else is working but you and the girls, and as your part of the war effort, you can do your own dishes!\" She shut the door sharply and walked briskly down the street. Jessica looked bewildered. \"Grandma, of all people!\" said Judith. \"And what kind of job can she get, an old woman like that!\" \"Oh,\" said Patty slowly, \"One of the women this morning said something \" she grabbed the morning paper and rifled the pages, stopping to study one intently. \"Yes, here it is!\" She read aloud: \"Elderly woman in excellent health and fond of children would like to care for babies of defense workers. Day work preferred. Dial 6-4220. Mrs. Sheldon,\"\nTomorrow's Cup\nAnna Prince Redd\nChapter IV\nSynopsis: Janet, protectingly reared in Washington, D. C., lives in constant dread of the San Juan country of Utah where her husband, Paul Morgan, has an Indian trading post on the mesa. She plans on their moving to Washington before the birth of her baby, but does not disclose this intention to her husband. Upon returning home with Paul after a happy week spent on the mesa, they find that Janet's sister, Rhae, and her husband Warren Newsbaum, have arrived for a short visit with the announced intention of taking Janet back to Washington with them. The next morning Paul is hurt when he saves Warren from being dragged by a broncho.\nExcept for Juanee, there wasn't a soul within fifteen miles of the trading post. Paul, Indian Joe, Juanee's husband, and the rest of the ranch outfit were out on the winter range getting ready for the spring roundup. An open winter and months of warm rains had kept the range in good shape; cattle were rolling fat; steers would be ready for the market weeks ahead of time. Paul had little time for anything else. But being alone had long since ceased being a terror to Janet. There was so much to be done before the coming of the baby that she had no time for worry or unpleasant thoughts. Even the country seemed less appalling. Since the day, months ago, when Caesar had almost killed Paul, she had known she could never leave El Toro unless Paul came, too. There would never again be any doubt of that, but she still clung to the thought that someday she would win him away. But now, after the long slow months of his recovery, Paul seemed more entrenched than ever. As soon as he was well enough to be out on the range again, he had plunged into an orgy of buying and selling that frightened her. If he became too involved, he would be less easily uprooted; less inclined to turn things over to an overseer as she meant him to do. Seeing him lying there with broken bones and helpless, idle hands, she had said over and over again that only his life mattered. Where she lived or what she did was unimportant. She smiled, now, at the thought of how Rhae and Warren even the nurse and the specialist that Warren had imported to care for Paul had conspired to get her to terminate what they called her self-inspired martyrdom, using her condition as the hatchet over her head. \"I'll go to a hospital if Paul is well enough to go with me,\" she had promised them, and nothing they could say had changed her mind. \"I could have a specialist come here, couldn't I? Just as you came to Paul, Dr. Meade.\" \"Having a baby out of a hospital is impossible!\" Rhae cried indignantly. \"Father would not hear of such a thing. Mother always had the best hospitals.\"\nPage 401\n402\n\"Yet mother died.\" Janet replied softly. \"And Juanee was confined right here in her hogan back of El Toro and nothing happened at all.\" Then brightly: \"Except that she presented the reservation with its first twins in fifty years!\" \"You make me sick!\" Rhae scorned. \"How can you talk like that? You'd think you were a common common \" \"Squaw? Or one of the dozens of fine women I know here in the desert?\" Janet was positively delighted at the strength of her own arguments. She had almost believed them herself! Thinking of it now it didn't seem so funny. She'd go to a hospital of course. Paul wouldn't hear of anything else, they'd planned that as soon as they were alone, and he was well enough to sit out in the patio and talk. But, though Paul was coming home to go to Washington with her, she didn't want to go at all. She sighed. El Toro was so lazy and comfortable. Facing the old life again after nearly four years of isolation, was a bit terrifying. She'd probably shy from a train as range horses did from an automobile! And she didn't even have fashionable clothes. But that, too, was easily remedied. With money to burn if she wanted it, she could buy to her heart's content. Juanee came in with a log for the fire. Janet held up the tiny dress she was embroidering. \"How does that look, Juanee? Isn't it adorable?\" \"It is too white. It is too small. My twin boys would spoil that in one minute. Mister Paul will be home tonight. He will say you should buy Levis for a boy!\"-JULY 1943\n\"Yes, he would. He has named the child already. It's to be Jerry. I call him Paul.\" \"You better start thinking up names in case a girl comes.\" \"Juanee, don't you go predicting a girl. Paul would be devastated.\" \"But you love what comes. Huh? Mister Paul, too.\" \"You're a great comfort, Juanee. You have better sense than most women.\" Juanee smiled broadly. \"Miss Janet nice woman, too!\" Janet laughed. \"Thanks Juanee. How are the twins? Do they like being at the school?\" \"Not now. Soon they will, just like their papa and mama did. Are we not warm and comfortable here with you because of the school? My begays will learn to like the school.\" \"It must be grand to have twins!\" \"Oh, yes! You like to have twins?\" Janet laughed in surprise. \"Oh, no, Juanee. One is all I could manage. I'd be scared to death of two!\" \"You have two big loves or one big love. You give me two dollars or one dollar, I take two dollars!\" Juanee brushed the last spark from the hearth and went back to her work.\nA car wheezed into the yard and Janet knew Dr. Potsworth had come to make his weekly call. He was a lovable, shrewd old man, and a valuable doctor. She knew he'd like to officiate at her child's birth, here at El Toro, just as he'd brought hundreds of other babies into other homes, without fuss or bother. She'd a notion to take him along to Washington with her when she went to the hospital.\nTOMORROW'S CUP\nThe thought conjured up such a picture of Rhae's horror at sight of the fat, bewhiskered little man, that Janet laughed aloud. \"Fine, Janet, fine!\" Dr. Potsworth exclaimed, coming in at the door. \"I wish I had a strong, healthy girl like you to be mother to the one that's coming in the trapper's hut down on the river. She's a puny little thing. No spirit. No spirit at all!\" When the doctor had gone, Janet sat thinking of what he had said. She knew that \"puny little thing down on the river.\" A slip of a girl who had never known hardship until she married a man of her family's choosing, a Frenchman of many promises and good looks. They had finally, after years and years of poverty and hardship, come to this. The trapper's wife was the one that should be going to the big hospital, the good food, and the white-clad nurses! This country had broken her spirit as it had her lovely little body. Just as it broke others, stronger than herself! Janet's peace was gone. The floodgates were raised, letting her emotions tumble pell-mell over each other. All the fears she had accumulated crowded in with renewed force, stronger for their enforced idleness. \"Spirit!\" Janet stood up angrily. \"Poor little trapper's wife. She hasn't a chance! Oh, if Paul only knew how I hate, how I \" Taos woke abruptly. Not, Janet could see, from anything she had done, but from uneasy intuition. He sniffed the air and went toward the door. Janet followed and opened it, letting him out. For a minute she could see nothing to be excited\n403\nabout, and was about to draw the dog inside and close the door, when a horseman came up over a ridge to the east. Janet hugged herself against the damp wind, debating whether to go in or wait. Long before she could see the rider clearly, she knew it was an Indian. Only lithe, bareback riders have that motionless grace. No flapping of arms or legs, no body motion except the rhythm of balanced posture. \"See, Taos, it's only an Indian begay a boy.\" Janet was as calm as if it had been one of Juanee's twins. Taos continued to growl. Juanee came to the door and stood by Janet. \"That's Mike's begay,\" she said. \"He's a no good boy!\" \"What does Mike's begay want?\" Janet demanded the minute the boy slid from his horse. \"I come here.\" He pointed to Juanee, and after that he talked rapidly in Navajo, ignoring Janet entirely. Janet was more piqued than she cared to admit. Why hadn't she taken the trouble to learn Navajo. Mike's begay had shifty eyes, and she didn't like the way he peered into the rooms behind her. She gave Taos a tug on his collar and drew him reluctantly, inside, closing the door after him. The minute they were left alone, Juanee's voice became suspicious, low-pitched; the Indian boy's more persuasive. Janet listened nervously. It was silly to imagine things every time anyone came on the place. Yet why was it that as soon as Paul went away, even for a day, every renegade on the reservation seemed to know it, and to take advantage of his absence. Nowhere was there a more crafty In-\n404\ndian than Mike, and his boy looked equal to his breed. Perhaps she had cause to feel nervous. Juanee came in. \"My mother is very sick,\" she said. \"Mike's begay says she will die. She wants me to come.\" Her voice was so filled with a mixture of doubt and anguish that she could hardly speak the words. \"But you just came home from your father's hogan, Juanee,\" Janet protested. \"Your mother was not sick then!\" \"That is what I cannot understand. But the begay brings this to make me know.\" Juanee held up an exquisite silver cross, set with turquoise. \"My mother say she keep this until she die, then it is for me. That is how I know that Mike's begay does not lie.\" \"You must go at once, Juanee,\" Janet said, sorry for even a moment's doubt of the Indian woman's faithfulness. \"But I cannot leave you, Miss Janet!\" \"Of course you can. I'm perfectly well, and Mr. Paul will be home tonight.\" Juanee shook her head mournfully, looking first at the Indian boy, waiting, astride his horse, then at her mistress. Janet noted her uneasiness and it increased her own. But there was no help for it. Juanee must go to her people. \"You must go, Juanee,\" she urged. \"Send your cousin Myrrup back to stay with me if it will make you feel easier. Now hurry!\" Juanee hesitated, clutching the silver cross. She went to a desk, took out a small pistol, held it up significantly, and placing it on the mantel above the glowing fire, said: \"Mr.-JULY 1943\nPaul taught you to use this, Miss Janet; he know someday you may need to shoot very straight!\" Janet laughed nervously. \"I'll scare the daylight out of anyone who bothers me,\" she boasted, \"so please hurry!\" Under her breath she added, \"Before I weaken.\" \"May the Father of my people remember to walk by this house,\" Juanee said, and, turning, went out. A few minutes later she rode around the corner of the house on her own horse, and was gone, one twin in her arms, the other blanketed to her back. The Indian boy rode after them across the flats. Taos strained at his collar, but Janet held him in. \"It's all right, Taos,\" she assured him. \"Come and lie down by the fire.\"\nShe sewed for an hour, watching Taos between times. \"Why don't you go to sleep?\" she said finally. \"You make me nervous with your watching.\" Taos thumped his tail but remained attentively awake. In the warm silence Janet dozed, only to be suddenly awake again. Why, she didn't know. Taos had not even raised his head, but his hair bristled and his eyes searched her face. She reached over and patted his head, thinking she'd be better off alone, he was such an old fuss-budget. The clock ticked. The fire crackled. A log fell apart and rolled out on the hearth. Janet took the tongs and put the log back on the fire. Taos whined to get out and she opened the door for him, leaving it ajar so he could come in again. Five minutes passed. Ten. \"Taos!\" she called sharply. \"Come in!\" \"He no come in. He dead.\" Janet whirled toward the guttural\nTOMORROW'S CUP\nvoice behind her. \"Mike!\" she gasped. \"How did you get in this room? What are you doing here?\" The Indian smiled insolently. \"White squaw very nice,\" he said. \"Me want whiskey! You come store.\" Janet was trying desperately to hide her fear. \"You know there is no whiskey in the store. Paul Morgan knows whiskey is bad medicine. He will whip you if he finds you here.\" \"You come store,\" the Indian said savagely. \"Me no key,\" Janet said. Her first panic was over. She'd show this filthy savage she wasn't afraid of him or his country either. \"You heap key. Me no fool. White squaw get key or me shoot!\" \"You haven't a gun, Mike, or you'd have used it before this. Now get out!\" She whirled to the mantel. \"I have a gun, see?\" Mike backed away from the gun she whipped into his face, but his eyes lost none of their insolent assurance. \"Me knife!\" he said, and drew a long hunting knife from inside his shirt. \"Me kill dog. Me kill you.\" A dozen guns could not have held the terror for Janet of that long sharp knife. \"I'll I'll get the key,\" she gasped. She backed toward the kitchen door, barely managing to keep the pistol leveled at Mike's head. If only she could get through the door and bolt it there might be time for Paul to come. She turned the knob behind her with her free hand and stepped backward through the door. A shrill laugh stopped her and a small, incredibly strong hand twisted the gun from her fingers. Mike's begay shoved her tri-\n405\numphantly aside and took the gun to his father. Janet staggered, threw her desperate weight against the door, bolting it with the strong oak latch. \"Taos! Where are you?\" She shuddered. Taos was dead or he'd be tearing Mike to shreds. She could hear Mike swearing, searching for the store key. She backed along the wall. \"Paul! Oh, please come now, Paul!\" She prayed. \"Father in Heaven, what shall I do?\" Suddenly the answer came. In her backing along the wall she had bumped into the big cupboard that hid the trap door to the Devil's Corridor. She remembered her husband's laughing words as they had climbed up the corridor, that never-to-be-forgotten day, and out onto the mesa: \"If any Indians ever try to get funny with you, Janet, just you remember this crack. You can get to it from the kitchen... Trap door under the big cupboard....\" She dropped to her knees, shoved a stack of magazines aside from the floor of the cupboard, and crawled in, closing the door carefully behind her. To breathe in such a cramped position was nearly impossible. She tugged at the back panel; it slid to one side, revealing a flight of steep steps that led to a small cave at the mouth of the corridor. Once down these steps and into the corridor she'd be safe. Mike would never find her there. She descended the steps and stood listening. A splintering sound over her head told her that the door she had bolted between herself and Mike had given way. Now, he'd know she was gone. There was a puzzled silence. Then: \"Chinde Clish!\" in Mike's surprised\n406\nvoice. \"Chinde Clish!\" his boy repeated, and banged his boots against the cupboard door. Janet's heart stopped. She had not taken time to close the back panel of the cupboard. If the front door came open they would find the corridor. Mike grunted and overturned the table in his disgust. That told Janet she was still safe. She ran along the floor of the rear cave, to where the real corridor began. There the air was better. She'd climb part way up and wait for Paul to come. Sounds from the house grew fainter, going toward the store. A shot echoed along the corridor as if it had been fired into. Shouts from the direction of the store told Janet that Mike was headed that way, that for the time at least, he had forgotten about her. If he hadn't found the store key he would probably shoot out the windows. When he failed to find whiskey, he would set fire to the store and ride sullenly away. He might even set fire to the house. A sob shook her. They couldn't burn her home. Not El Toro! Paul loved El Toro. He must not come home and find it gone. She ran back along the corridor, stumbling blindly, tears drenching her face. Those renegades would find what she could do if they dared touch El Toro! The passage narrowed until she was crouching again, fighting for breath with every step. A sharp pain made her cry out. She had forgotten her condition. The baby was more important than life. She must not go back until Paul came. And she prayed it might be soon. \"That was a labor pain!\" her mind-JULY 1943\nstated, waiting for a second pain as one strains to catch a faint disturbing noise in the night. It came and Janet sat down heavily. \"I'm going to have a baby!\" she said, \"here alone!\" Her words echoed hollowly along the corridor. Restraint snapped. \"That's what's happening to me,\" she cried. \"That's what your country is doing to me, Paul Morgan. And I just sit here babbling like an idiot!\" A longer pain choked her voice. When it was over, she became suddenly calm. She was being utterly foolish; she had to stop this nonsense. It might be hours before her husband came. Squaws often had their babies alone, and and so could she! She found a sand-covered ledge and curled up on it, determined to relax. Mike must be gone for she hadn't heard a sound for ages. And she couldn't smell smoke. Maybe he wouldn't burn El Toro. A drowsy numbness enveloped her. \"It must be sleep,\" she thought. But her relief was short lived. Pains came in quick succession. \"Paul!\" His name brought no answer. If only she could get back to the fire; it was cold and damp in the corridor. Paul would never find her here. She slid from the bank, dragging her feet painfully, walking was so hard. If she sat down just for a minute then she could get to the trap door. It was hot and close in the corridor now. What she needed was air fresh air! \"Paul \" The word died away in the empty distance. Janet sighed and sank quietly in the dark.\n(To be continued)\nNOTES FROM THE FIELD\nVera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer\nRegulations governing the submittal of material for \"Notes from the Field\" appear in the Magazine for June 1942, page 420."

            "content": "MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS\nNew Zealand Mission\nELVA T. COWLEY, president of Relief Societies in the New Zealand Mission, wrote as follows in a letter dated March 28, 1943:\n\"Since we started the welfare and beautification program in this mission, the response and results have been most gratifying. Many homes have been beautified and gardens planted. Nearly every home has its welfare cupboard and some of the Relief Societies have their Society cupboards.\n\"Non-members of the Church comment on the great improvement in the homes and yards of the Maoris and ask what has been the incentive behind such improvement. When told about our Church-wide plan they are very interested.\n\"Since this country became engaged in the war, many of our sisters have devoted their time and energy to doing patriotic work. This has weakened some of our branch organizations, especially in localities where families have moved into town to be near essential industries. However, large sums of money and materials have been turned over to the government through the efforts of our women.\n\"Letters of appreciation from the Red Cross have been received by some of our Societies for their generous contributions of knitted articles and made-over clothing. Also some of the sisters have contributed to and served in patriotic stores in the towns.\n\"Last March, throughout the mission, the various branches observed the centennial of the Relief Society. Every program was a credit to the sisters and the Church. Several of the banquets, with the many varieties of delicious food and beautifully decorated cakes, could not have been excelled by any organization.\n\"Memorial trees were planted throughout the mission with special ceremonies conducted. One touching incident was related to me by a sister whose branch postponed its tree planting for more favorable climatic conditions. She said she couldn't let the eventful day pass without planting a tree so she went to the bush and dug up a young tree and planted it in her own garden, and conducted a simple ceremony by herself.\"\nTahitian Mission\nVENUS R. ROSSITER, president of Relief Societies in the Tahitian Mission, wrote the following interesting letter February 6, 1943:\n\"Our sisters are enjoying the lessons on the Articles of Faith very much, frequently expressing themselves to that effect.\nPage 407\n408\n\"The handwork of the societies in the Tuamuto (or low coral reef) islands is chiefly shell work, while the societies in Tubuai weave very fine Panama hats and mats. At Papeete we have been crocheting, also weaving baskets and various types of hats and hat braids. We do not realize a great deal for our work, however, since the rate of exchange is so low (44 francs to the dollar). The sisters in all of the branches clean the meeting houses and care for the grounds surrounding them.\n\"It might be interesting to you to know a little about their shell work and hat weaving, both of which are long tedious procedures. First of all, many days are spent hunting for the shells on the sandy beaches or prying them loose from the rocks of the reefs. Then follow days of washing, cooking, and drying in the sun to clean and cure them, after which the shells are sorted as to type, size, and color. Then they are finally made up into portieres, handbags, collars, hatbands, belts, necklaces, bracelets, and simple strands, and brought to Papeete to sell to the exporters. Making hats, too, means a great deal more work than the weaving. First the leaves, barks, or palm fronds must be cut and carefully selected, then cooked until they are soft and pliable, bleached for days in the sun, and finally scraped and cut to the proper width and thickness before finally starting the weaving. When dyes can be procured, the lustrous bamboo barks are dyed in different colors. The hats are then finished by starching and blocking. When we were here twenty-five years ago practically all hats were the same style for young and old, but-JULY 1943\nnow the native women copy hats from most any picture they see.\n\"We have been very much isolated during the past year, having received mail from home only twice. But notwithstanding the isolation and the fact that President Rossiter and I are here alone in the mission, we are very happy and enjoying our work to the fullest.\"\nCanadian Mission\nEMILY J. SMITH, Relief Society president of the Canadian Mission reports:\n\"Every month one of the Relief Societies of the mission makes up a twenty-pound box of clothing, quilts, and many other useful and needed articles. This is then sent to the British Mission under a special license to import which has been granted them by the British Government. There the articles are distributed to members of the Church who are in need.\n\"The sisters in the Canadian Mission are giving splendid cooperation, and we all feel that the gratitude of our brethren and sisters in England is more than sufficient reward for our efforts.\"\nNew England Mission\nBERTHA S. REEDER, Relief Society president of the New England Mission, and Elder Kenneth W. Porter, mission auxiliary supervisor, submitted the following report March 24, 1943:\n\"You may be interested to learn of some of the activities of the Relief Society of the New England Mission. Although nothing spectacular has been achieved, we feel that steady progress is being made in this very important line of work.\nRelief Society Conference of the Zurich District, Switzerland\nHeld in 1942, with a number of visitors from Basel including (1) Anna Stoecklin, the acting Relief Society mission president; (2) Anna Baumann, first counselor from Zurich; Sister Schellenberg of Bern, the second counselor, was unable to be present on account of transportation problems. The gathering is known as the \"Herbst Tagung\" (Fall Conference). The photograph was recently received in Salt Lake City by Karl and Matilde Scheuermann Senhauser from their daughter, Hilde Senhauser Ringger of Zurich, Switzerland. For this picture Theis indebted to Elder Thomas E. McKay, one of the assistants to the Council of the Twelve and President of the European Missions.\n\"On March 14, throughout the mission, programs commemorating Anniversary Day were held in almost all branches. From St. John, Canada, to Bridgeport, Connecticut, our members, investigators, and friends met together to pay tribute to the Society that has done so much. The program suggestions printed in the January issue of the Magazine were quite generally followed, and those attending the various meetings had an enjoyable and profitable time. The following report is from one of our elders at St. John:\n\"'Last Sunday, March 14, the sisters presented a very fine program in sacrament meeting. They presented the entire program including the singing except for the sacramental hymn. It was outlined and supervised by Sister Cora Truswell. Each of the seven members of the Relief Society participated in one capacity or another. They were all dressed in white blouses and black skirts which added to the effectiveness.\n\"'A March 17th social was also prepared by the Relief Society, under the direction of Sister Mildred Lowe. The evening's entertainment consisted of an excellent program of several individual numbers, a short play followed by very good refreshments, and a group of games. Forty-four people, half of them non-members, were present on this occasion. The members of this Relief Society deserve a great deal of praise for the work they are doing and the fine\nNOTES FROM THE FIELD\n409\n410\nprogress they are making in their many lines of work under the direction of President Jessie Frye.'\n\"Other programs worthy of special mention were held at Portland, Maine; Burlington, Vermont; Providence, Rhode Island; and other cities.\n\"The organization of new societies is being undertaken as soon as can wisely be done. Yesterday, March 24, a few ladies at Hyde Park, Massachusetts, were officially organized and grouped into a home Relief Society. Within a very short time, another home Relief Society will be effected, this one at Newport, Rhode Island. With the help of the missionaries (they are gradually becoming Relief Society conscious), we are attempting to see that as many women as possible are given the privilege of seeing and having the benefits of this work.\"\nSpanish-American Mission\nTHE following excerpts are from a letter dated December 30, 1942, from Emma G. Haymore, former president of Relief Societies of the Spanish-American Mission who was succeeded in March 1943, by Ivie H. Jones:\n\"I marvel at the power of Relief Society in the mission field. While I admit I have reared my nine boys and girls on Relief Society, I had not realized how much women need this organization, and how much women need women to lead them. At Fresno, we put the Relief Society on a firmer foundation by calling and setting apart officers from among the local sisters. We wish to get our capable sisters working that they may be able to help themselves should our missionary force be reduced too much to reach them all.-JULY 1943\nThen, too, they grow faster as they carry responsibility. You will enjoy reading the accomplishments of our Phoenix Relief Society in the following letter from Elders Christiansen and Mann:\n\"'This past Friday evening we held our \"Cena Mexicana\" which was considered quite a success in the true meaning of the word. Our Relief Society sisters donated the food and prepared a Mexican dinner for 215 which was considered one of the best the public had ever enjoyed. We had a most extraordinary program of Spanish dances, songs, religious songs in Spanish, and other special numbers. The people, including some of our best investigators, were really gratified with the fine evening's entertainment. The net proceeds of our program proved to be $100. We have been asked to give a similar program every two or three months. This plan has proved so successful that our Relief Society sisters have decided that they would like to use it as a project for raising money for the purpose of building a Spanish chapel in Phoenix after the war.'\"\nHawaiian Mission\nTHE following excerpts are from letters of December 10, 1942 and March 25, 1943, from Inez Waldron, president of Relief Societies of the Hawaiian Mission:\n\"Enclosed are voluntary donations from the Hoolehua, Molokai Branch Relief Society toward the Relief Society centennial campanile. It was sent to me with the report that the members of that branch felt that they couldn't let the one-hundredth birthday year close without sending in a birthday gift to the General Board.\nNOTES FROM THE FIELD\n411\nOjai Branch Relief Society, California Mission, Organized May 28, 1943\nThe President, Marguerette Harris, is fourth from the left, first row standing. Fourth from left on the second row standing is Mignon Snyder, assistant district aid. In front are Elders Ward F. Jarman, and A. Woodrow Peterson, who submitted this picture.\n\"If you could only know these people you would understand why they felt this way. They are among the poorest people in the Church as far as temporal and worldly possessions are concerned, and yet they are among the richest, spiritually. They make very little money from their homestead lands, and that they give to the Church. They gather as one family in their chapel every week and worship in love and harmony. Twenty Relief Society women and ten Priesthood members came over to Honolulu by airplane, which is the only inter-island transportation now, for their annual excursion to the Temple. This is the tenth consecutive year that they have made this excursion during the Thanksgiving week, but the first time they have ever come by air. This was a great added expense, but they were able to make it because of their determination and the cooperation of the Saints who remained behind.\n\"This kind of spirit exists throughout the Hawaiian Mission. Several of the Relief Societies have discontinued, perhaps for the duration of the war, for all of the women are engaged seven days a week in various phases of the war effort. On the whole, however, the Societies of the mission are progressing very nicely. The sisters and missionaries report that they are thoroughly enjoying the project work that we have outlined for them this year. These include the canning and storing of fruits and vegetables in season, storing of blankets, making and storing of quilts, baby layettes, and other things which may become scarce here in case shipping is cut off. They are also reconditioning and storing all old clothing. There have been welfare committees organized in each branch and district to have charge of this work. The Relief Society is cooperating with the Priesthood also in helping on the welfare farms and in the Victory Gardens. They have learned the art of canning and storing fruits and vegetables from the women in the University of Hawaii Extension Service in each district.\n\"Every Society that was large enough, completed, by December 31, its quota of three quilts and the purchasing of five blankets, all of which were to be stored in the various district storehouses. By March 31, they will have completed three baby layettes in each branch. The remaining spring months are to be spent in reconditioning the clothing that has been gathered by the welfare committees in each district. Also, the sisters are going to make and outfit first-aid kits to be kept in the Relief Society rooms, and smaller individual ones for their automobiles. Throughout the summer months during lesson vacation they will can and preserve mangoes, pineapples, and papaias that are in such abundance during those months. Fortunately, the islands at present are well stocked with canning supplies and equipment.\n\"Many of our Relief Society sisters are giving fine service to the country at this time in holding responsible positions in the Red Cross and other war units in their communities. I'm sure that one of the contributing factors to their success and interest in these things is the splendid training along so many lines that they have received in the Relief Society and other organizations in our Church.\"\nERRATA\nCost of Leather Binding forATTENTION is called to an error made in the May 1943, issue of the Magazine, page 336, in quoting the price of leather binding for the 1942 volume of TheThe price of leather binding, including index, where Magazines are furnished with the order is $2.50 per volume, instead of $2 as therein stated.\nMagazine Honor Roll\nInadvertently omitted from the Magazine subscription honor roll for 1942, as published in the May issue, 1943, was the following: Oklahoma City Branch Relief Society of the Central States Mission, Pearl Anderson, Magazine representative; Relief Society membership 19, subscriptions 15, percentage 78.\n-JULY 1943"

            "content": "Annual Report 1942\nVera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer\nOBSERVANCE of the Relief Society centennial and increased participation in war services in addition to regular activities, characterized the work of the Relief Society during the year 1942. Adding new interest to the report and further means of more fully gauging the extent of Relief Society services are several new items of data collected for the first time in 1942, such as number of quilts made and number of funerals at which comfort and assistance was given, services which have characterized the work of the Society from its beginning, but which have never before been counted on a Church-wide basis. Unfortunately, complete records were not kept in all local Relief Societies of the newly required data, resulting in what is believed to be a considerable understatement of Relief Society services. Furthermore, because of limitations in shipping facilities incident to the war, current reports were not received from some of the distant missions in time for inclusion in the 1942 compilations. Therefore, figures in the annual report with respect to some of the long-time services and to all of the more recently instituted services relating to the Church Welfare Plan and to the war do not represent the full measure of the accomplishments. Nevertheless, the following statistical data give impressive evidence of the magnitude of the work accomplished. These facts are presented with full realization that they do not attempt to measure all the varied services of the Society to others, or the inestimable and intangible values to the members themselves which come from participation in Relief Society's two-fold program of education and service.\nRELIEF SOCIETY CENTENNIAL\nConstituting a part of this annual report is the comprehensive summary of the Church-wide celebration of the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Society which was published in Thefor April 1942. This was followed by detailed reports of many of the local observances held in wards, stakes, branches, and missions which have since appeared in the Magazine as \"Notes From the Field\" in the issues of July, October, November, and December of 1942, and January, February, and March of 1943. The \"Notes\" in the issues for June 1942, and May 1943, relating to Relief Society choruses of Singing Mothers, should also be considered as a part of this series of centennial reports, as these choruses were extensively featured in centennial programs, concerts, pageants, tree plantings, and other services. The concluding memento of the centennial year was the publication in the fall of 1942 of \"A Centenary of Relief Society,\" commemorating in picture and story the history and achievements of the Society during its first\nPage 413\n414\none hundred years. In the brief period between its publication and the end of the year, 10,298 copies of this handsome book had been purchased. Other personal centennial souvenirs, all of lasting value, had been bought in the following quantities: Relief Society membership pin, 6,677; plate depicting organization meeting, 1,452; and \"A Legacy Relief Society Centennial Anthology of Verse,\" 972. In addition, the official centennial insignia in the form of seals or stickers had been ordered in the amount of 172,800 for attaching to programs of centennial observances, place cards, invitations, correspondence, et cetera. The annual reports showed a total of 874 centennial trees planted, of which 779 were permanently designated by means of a uniform bronze tree marker made available by the General Board.\nWAR SERVICES\nRelief Society organizations in the United States, constituting the majority of the 2,273 local Societies, undertook various activities related to the war effort during 1942, immediately after the United States became involved in war near the end of the preceding year. Most of the other countries where Relief Societies are located were already engaged in war, and the local Societies in those countries continued their efforts for the relief of war sufferers which were started as soon as their countries became involved.\nCurtailment of Travel\nThe first important change in Relief Society work in the United States due to the war was made with respect to curtailment of travel and reduction of attendant personal expenses, in conformity with recommendations of the First Presidency issued January 17, 1942, months prior to the rationing of gasoline and the restriction of automobile tires for civilian use. In applying the recommendations of the First Presidency to the Relief Society, the General Board on February 19, 1942, announced curtailment of supervisory functions involving travel as follows: 1. Discontinued regular monthly stake and ward officers' union meetings; 2. Discontinued the annual stake Relief Society conferences to which representatives of the General Board are sent; 3. Curtailed to instances of special need visits by General Board members to stakes, and by stake board members to local Relief Societies; 4. Cancelled the semi-annual general\nconferences of Relief Society in Salt Lake City, attended by delegates from all stakes of the organization. In addition, it also postponed the elaborate central celebration planned for the observance of the centennial of Relief Society into which many months of planning and preparation had gone. In order to help compensate for the curtailment of these supervisory activities, various suggestions and recommendations were made to help maintain and improve the standard of work despite these restrictions. The effect of these changes is reflected in the annual report by a ANNUAL REPORT decrease of 70 per cent or nearly 1,000 stake and ward officers' union meetings, from 1,397 In 1941 to 419 in 1942, and by a reduction in visits to wards by stake board members of 1,196 or 16 per cent, from 7,454 in 1941 to 6,258 in 1942. The spirit in which these restrictions were accepted and the adjustments made by stakes to help maintain efficiency in the local Relief Societies with these two principal mediums curtailed are demonstrated in the following excerpts, typical of many, from narrative statements which accompanied the annual reports: From Cottonwood Stake in Utah aAlthough we have held only one union meeting during 1942, we feel that the Relief Society work in our stake has grown and that we have had a successful year. We have missed our union meetings but find that the ward officers and class leaders have developed more initiative and are better able to shoulder responsibility. From Long Beach Stake in California  Our stake board members contact the ward board members in their departments by mail every month. Outlines are sent by class leaders and general instructions by officers. A copy of these letters are submitted to our president and we discuss them in our regular monthly board meeting. The ward members likewise take their letters to their respective ward preparation meetings and in this way we try to have a unity of our work. From Highland Stake in Salt Lake City  We greatly appreciate the splendid cooperation of our board members in contacting the wards since the discontinuance of union meetings. Both the board members and the ward class leaders and officers feel the loss of the contact made possible by those meetings, but all have cooperated in a very commendabl  manner in working out plans for their departments. We fee] that our lessons this year have been most successful. Our board members have contacted the wards by telephone, by personal visits both to homes of class leaders and to the wards, and by sending through 415 the mail written outlines and aids. We are very well pleased with the result of their efforts. From Snowflake Stake in Arizona Our annual fall visit to each ward was discouraging to undertake in 1942 as there were no private cars available due to war conditions. It looked like they must be discontinued. However, because of the reorganization of many wards, the stake board saw the need of the visits and met the emergency, though not in so comfortable a style as theretofore. The board members traveled on school busses, milk trucks, commercial busses, poultry trucks and whatnot, to reach the small Societies, sometimes staying overnight until transportation home could be found. But with the inconvenience they likely received more spirituality from the women than ever before, besides enjoying their home life and hospitality. It was a new experience and the sacrifice did good to all concerned. SURVEY OF REGISTERED AND PRACTICAL NuRSES In February 1942, the General Board of Relief Society instituted a survey of registered and practical nurses in all local units in the United States and Canada, which ascertained not only the number of nurses but the number employed and unemployed, and the number available for additional service. Lists of these nurses are maintained in all local units and kept continually up-to-date, and copies are in the files of the stake officers. 'Tabulation of the returns for the Society as a whole revealed, among other interesting data, that several hundred women, in addition to those already employed, could give some nursing service, either fulltime or part-time. It was found that the number of trained nurses, then unemployed, who could give fulltime service could be increased but slightly, possibly due to age, health, or family responsibilities, that the 416 number of trained nurses who could give part-time service could be more than doubled, that the number of practical nurses who could give fulltime service could be doubled, and that practical nurses who could give part-time service could be trebled. Relief Society Nurse Loan Funds Because of the greatly increased demand for trained nurses due to the war, the General Board of Relief Society during 1942 again directed attention to its two nurse loan funds  one for students at standard threeyear hospital nurse training courses, and one to assist graduate nurses to take university public health nursing courses. These loan funds have been in constant use for twenty years. Furthermore, the General Board increased the maximum amount which could be borrowed for hospital nurse training from $75.00 to $300.00 per student in order to more nearly meet present costs of training. Revrer Societies SERVING AS RED Cross Sewing Units In February 1942, the General Board of Relief Society released a plan specifying steps to be taken by local Relief Societies desiring to function as Red Cross units for sewing and knitting, and recommended that Red Cross sewing be done in the regular monthly work meeting of the Relief Society in addition to the sewing ordinarily done for charitable purposes of the Society. Annual reports for 1942 indicate that this recommendation was followed generally throughout the Relief Society, but data as to amount of sewing and knitting accomplished in Relief Society meetings appear to be greatly-JULY 1943 understated because many local Societies failed to keep a full account of the work which was done. Nevertheless, the reports indicate that an average of nearly 8,000 women did Red Cross sewing or knitting in each of the monthly Relief Society work meetings, giving more than 100,000 hours to this volunteer service and completing for the Red Cross 38,- 381 articles. These figures relate only to Red Cross service in connection with Relief Society meetings. They do not include the service of thousands of Relief Society women who have also assisted at Red Cross sewing and surgical dressings centers, nor those who have assisted as Red Cross nurse aids, canteen workers, et cetera. In addition, the Relief Society continued its own sewing program and gave other extra sewing services incident to the war as mentioned below under \"Sewing Service.\" Rep Cross Courses SPONSORED Also in February 1942, the Relief Society recommended to its members everywhere other Red Cross classes and services, such as home nursing, first aid, nutrition, nurse aids, canteen service, et cetera. Supplementing this recommendation, the Relief Society has circularized local units in certain areas, as for example, in Salt Lake City, announcing and highly recommending specific Red Cross classes with the result that these classes have been immediately filled. In a bulletin released at the end of 1942, the General 'Board gave new emphasis to this recommendation, urging that as many women as possible take Red Cross first-aid and home-nursing classes so that they would be better ANNUAL REPORT prepared to care for their families and others in ordinary instances of illness and also in case of disaster or epidemic. This recommendation recognized the increasing curtailment of hospital and nursing service for civilians, and the necessity of depending to greater extent on home nursing. Local Relief Societies were advised, wherever feasible, to provide themselves with the necessary beds and other equipment for demonstration at such home-nursing classes in order to make classes available in immediate vicinities thus reaching a larger number of Relief Society members. It was also recommended that in war risk areas one woman in each stake be called to become a first-aid instructor in order to help make possible an increased number of local classes in Red Cross first-aid training. The 1942 reports show that at least 10,222 Relief Society women completed Red Cross courses during the year, 4,062 in first aid, 3,839 in home nursing, 1,701 in nutrition, and 620 in other subjects. Because of the recommendations issued at the end of 1942, the year 1943 should show that an even greater number of women have completed Red Cross courses, particularly in first aid and home nursing. Other Provisions for First AID AND Home Nursing Continuing the century-long interest and activity of the Relief Society in health and nursing, the General Board, at the end of 1942, issued printed circulars for distribution to every family in the Church, urging that every possible precaution be taken to preserve health through such means as proper nutrition, adequate clothing and bedding, and gen- 417 eral care, and recommended that all families provide themselves with a family first-aid kit for use in case of disaster, accident, or household emergencies. At the same time all ward Relief Societies were asked to establish home-nursing supply chests, containing articles ordinarily needed for home nursing in case of sickness or disability, such articles to be either rented or loaned according to circumstances of families using the supplies. In this connection it is interesting to note from narrative reports from the stakes that the stake board and wards of at least one stake (Rexburg) had jointly purchased a secondhand hospital bed for home nursing purposes. The plan for home-nursing supply chests was an extension of the recommendations issued twenty years earlier that Relief Societies maintain maternity bundles for renting or loaning for home deliveries, a service which is still in effect in some communities without hospital facilities. In addition, all Relief Societies considering themselves to be in war risk areas were asked to provide themselves with a ward first-aid kit, including quilts and blankets, and to make a house-to-house survey among Church families to list articles which could be made available upon call to the ward Relief Society president in case of an emergency entailing temporary housing other than in homes. OrHer War SERVICES During 1942, stake and ward Relief Society funds were invested in war bonds to the extent of $22,451.71. Representatives of the General Board of Relief Society and of stake and local Societies are serving 418 on various state and local committees related to the war effort, including various Red Cross committees, Civilian Defense committees, state and local women's salvage committees, U. S. O. Committees, state and local nutrition and food conservation committees, state and community health organizations, committees on war relief, and committees relating to day care for children of working mothers. In some areas direly needed assistance has been given in recruiting workers for harvesting and processing agricultural products. Early in 1942, the Relief Societies in Salt Lake City conducted a houseto-house survey among members of the Society leaving registration cards for those able to make accommodations available for women and girls coming into the area for defense work. Hundreds of suitable homes were registered by this means; the service of personally inspecting the quarters offered and of making placements has been conducted by the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. The Relief Society has also cooperated with the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association in other activities for the welfare of girls who leave home to take employment. In this connection, in December 1942, Relief Society visiting teachers left in every home with girls of M. I. A. Age a printed \"Message of Friendliness-JULY 1943 and Solicitation to the Mothers of the Church\" containing timely advice, and encouraging girls away from home to affiliate with the M. I. A. In their new places of residence. Themonthly publication of Relief Society with a circulation of 57,000, carries frequent announcements relating to the salvage program, to the need for nurses, and articles interpreting the government's price control and rationing program. In addition, Thehas carried a series of special articles by psychologists, social workers, and other specialists relating to wartime problems of both youths and adults. Two lesson courses in the 1942-43 series for Relief Societies throughout the United States were pertinent to the present situation one course, presented on the fourth Tuesday of each month and entitled \"What 'America' Means\" related the history, development, and values of American democracy, using The American Citizens Handbook as a reference; another course for monthly consideration on the second Tuesday of the month was entitled \"New Fashioned Thrift\" and related to current up-tothe-minute news and suggestions for homemakers, particularly from the standpoint of conservation and consumer buying under present conditions, with special reference to articles curtailed by war needs. RELIEF SOCIETY SERVICE UNDER CHURCH WELFARE PLAN As part of their routine organization 'work, Relief Society women have, during the past five years, supported the Church Welfare Plan in extensive conservation and production work with respect to both food and clothing. 'They have cooperated wholeheartedly in the collection and conditioning of great quantities of used clothing, in the making of hundreds of quilts and other articles of bedding, the weaving of rugs, the production of thousands of pieces of new clothing for men, women and. Chil- ANNUAL REPORT dren, the canning and drying of a tremendous amount of fruits and vegetables, and have helped to raise funds to meet Church welfare assignments in the form of cash. This service is being continued and is now recognized as a direct aid to the war effort. In addition to the sewing service given in Relief Society meetings where 19,446 pieces of clothing were reported to have been made during 1942 for distribution through bishops' storehouses under the Church USUAL RELIEF SOCIETY SEWING SERVICE In addition to sewing done in Relief Society meetings for the Red Cross as already mentioned, the Relief Society continued its own sewing service, making quilts and articles of clothing for distribution to the needy, both direct and through the bishops' storehouses, making quilts to order as an accommodation to families desiring this service and as a means of building up Relief Society funds. Many Relief Societies extended their usual sewing service during 1942 in order to encourage families to provide themselves with adequate bedding, and carried forward plans for assisting families to da so. These plans included quilting by the Society without charge of one or more quilts for each member, and assistance with materials for those families who could not provide their own. In addition, many local Relief Societies arranged to relieve conditions incident to labor shortages at nearby hospitals by making paper bedside bags, hospital gowns, and other supplies. Some Relief Societies also made thousands of drapes for soldiers' club rooms and gave some 419 Welfare Plan, Relief Society women gave a total of 210,346 hours on other projects operated under the Church Welfare Plan, principally on production projects, either locally or at stake or regional sewing and canning centers. Of this total, 38,945 hours were reported as given by women whose families were receiving aid from the storehouses and 171,401 hours were given in volunteer service by women not receiving this aid. SERVICES CONTINUED sewing service for other community purposes. Altogether, an average of 21,000 women gave sewing service at the monthly work meetings for these various purposes, not including the work for the Red Cross, giving a total of nearly 282,000 hours to these activities. When combined with figures relating to Red Cross sewing service, it is found that an average. Of nearly 29,000 women gave sewing service at each monthly work meeting to the total extent of approximately 382,000 hours, during which 116,882 articles were completed. Of this total number of articles, the greatest number (38,381 or approximately one-third of the total) was made for the Red Cross, with 29,048 being made for Relief Society, 19,446 for bishops' storehouses, and 30,007 for hospitals and all other agencies. As to kind of articles made, clothing for children constituted the largest single group, numbering 25,323 atticles. Next in importance were quilts numbering 13,034, followed by 10,141 pieces of women's clothing, 7,908 pieces of men's clothing, 4,610 pieces of other bedding, and 55,866 pieces of other articles including 420 hospital supplies, drapes for soldiers' club rooms, and other miscellaneous articles. COMPASSIONATE SERVICES It is not possible to measure fully the extent of compassionate service given by Relief Society women in their communities. Only a few of the many ways in which they minister to those in sorrow and distress can be satisfactorily counted, but these few items serve to give some idea of the kind and extent of these services. Special visits made to the sick and homebound by women representing the Relief Society were reported to be 116,006 in 1942. This count represented a decline of 74,000 visits or 39 per cent from the year 1941 which may be attributed to several factors including the possibility of less sickness. However, it is quite likely that the major part of this decline was due to renewed emphasis on counting only visits made in the name of Relief Society, with strict exclusion of visits made by Relief Society women to relatives or personal friends. In addition to these visits to the sick, the Relief Society provided 15,083 full days' care of the sick. This item also declined from the previous year by 17,000 days or 54 per cent, reflecting either less sickness or greater unavailability of women to give this service because of increased employment and new war work. In 1942, for the first time, the count of days' care of the sick was segregated between volunteer and paid service. It was found that by far the greater proportion of days' care of the sick was volunteer service by Relief Society women, which accounted for-JULY 1943 95 per cent or more than 14,000 of the 15,000 days' care given, whereas only 687 days or 5 per cent represented days' care of the sick by nurses or others to whom the Relief Society made payment for the service. The total number of bodies prepared for burial by Relief Society women was 882, a decrease of 311 or 26 per cent from the count of 1,193 in 1941. In 1942, for the first time, the count of this service was segregated between bodies completely prepared for burial where services of morticians were unavailable, and bodies to which Relief Society women gave only the service of dressing. Complete preparation for burial was made by Relief Society women with respect to more than onefourth of the bodies (252) whereas the service of clothing the body was provided in 630 instances. 'The 1942 count of number of funerals at which Relief Society women assisted was the first count of a service which Relief Society women have given from the beginning of the organization. This assistance was reported in connection with 4,315 funerals and consisted of service such as decorating the chapel, arranging floral offerings, and giving any needed service to bereav d families. VISITING 'TEACHING The number of monthly visits to families by Relief Society visiting teachers during 1942 totaled 1,1096,168, a decrease of 75,235 or 6 per cent from the previous year. 'This decline is attributed principally to war transportation conditions. Early in 1942, the General Board released plans for dividing visiting teachers' districts into smaller sub-districts so that more homes would b  within ANNUAL REPORT walking distance in those areas where homes are scattered and transportation is ordinarily required for visiting. Even so, lack of transportation facilities has made it impossible for many visits to be made. Realizing that this would be the case, provisions were made for recording and counting communications in lieu of visits, such as messages sent by mail and telephone calls. 'These communications in lieu of visits amounted to 17,518 offsetting only partially the decline in actual visits made. In 1942, for the first time, the count of visits was segregated between families found to be at home when visited, and those not home. According to these data, Relief Society teachers found families at home in 69 per cent of the visits made, and in 31 per cent of the visits no one was   home. Lacking comparative data for previous years, it is assumed that the proportion of families not home when visited was high in 1942 due to war conditions such as increased industrial employment of women and greater absence from home occasioned by volunteer service in war work. Although careful account has always been kept in the wards of the individuals making voluntary contributions to the Society through the visiting teachers, some idea of the total number of families contributing was compiled for the first time in 1942. These data show that the average number of families making contributions each month was approximately 38,879, 22 per cent of the reported total of 177,000 Latterday Saint families. It is realized however, that the total number of different families making contributions doubtless exceeded this num- 421 ber considerably, as some families may have contributed one month and not another. The annual reports indicate that contributions received by the visiting teachers aggregated $117,706.72 for the year, of which $66,909.68 went into the Relief Society charity fund, and $50,- 797.04 into the general fund. Relief Society Meetings HELP The General Board, and stake, ward, and mission Relief Societies conducted a total of 74,657 meetings during 1942, a decrease of 1,613 or 2 per cent from 1941, despite the organization during the year of 5 new stakes and 2 new missions, 14 more ward Relief Societies and 57 more branch Relief Societies in missions. Local Relief Society meetings of all types held declined but slightly, whereas stake meetings were fewer by 1,321, or 34 per cent, dropping from 3,889 in 1941 to 2,568 in 1942. The decrease in stake meetings was due principally to the curtailments required incident to the war discontinuance of union meetings except as especially authorized, and limitation of stake board meetings to not more than one a month. Stake and ward officers' union meetings declined 70 per cent from 1,397 to 419, but this loss was partly offset by 393 modified stake meetings, held in connection with other gatherings, or as opportunity afforded. Stake board meetings dropped 35 per cent, from 2,492 to 1,621. A decline of 85 or 5 per cent was recorded in the number of annual ward Relief Society conferences held, which numbered 1,611 in 1942 as compared with 1,696 in 1941. Preliminary officers' meetings were held in connection 422 with 1,172 of the 1,611 ward conferences, in accordance with a new recommendation to this effect by the General Board. In i942, the General Board recommended the holding of regular monthly officers' preparation meetings in wards. Altogether, these ward preparation meetings totaled 7,024 during the year. Monthly training meetings for visiting teachers totaled 8,005. Opportunity for the Relief Society to participate in the program of one session of the stake quarterly conference once during the year was provided in 89 of the 143 stakes. The regular ward Relief Society meetings for members (weekly during eight-month period October through May, and monthly during four-month period May through September), totaled 54,244. Each of these meetings was attended by an average of 31,270 members representing 29 per cent of the total member-JULY 1943 ship. This was a decline in average attendance of approximately 10,000 members per meeting from 1941, when the average attendance represented nearly 36 per cent of the total membership. This drop in attendance of 24 per cent from the previous year is attributed largely to increased employment of women during this war period. The count in 1942 by types of meetings makes it possible to analyze for the first time the attendance in relation to the different lesson courses presented in rotation at the four weekly meetings during the educational season, October through May. The first meeting of the month, devoted to theology and testimony-bearing, is the best attended in both the stakes and missions, with each succeeding meeting. Of the month declining slightly in popularity at about the same rate in both stakes and missions, as shown in the following summary table: Average Attendance at Local Relief Society Meetings Wards in Stakes 29,100 27,297 26,447 26,034 27,219 Branches in Missions 3,943 3,897 3,827 3,706 4,051\" All Relief Societies 33,043 31,194 30,274 29,740 31,270 *Total average attendance high in relation to attendance by type of meeting because type of meeting not reported by all mission branches. A topic in homemaking is provided by the General Board for optional use for discussion in the monthly work-and-business meeting, which is devoted principally to sewing. The 1942 report indicates for the first time the extent of the use of this optional topic. This home topic was discussed at 9,062 or 53 per cent of the total of 17,157 work-and-business meetings held. These topics were more widely used in the stakes than in the missions, being discussed in 7,746 or 60 per cent of the 12,824 work meetings held in the wards, and in 1,316 or 30 per cent of the 4,333 work meetings held in the missions. These topics are not provided for the\nTheology and Work-and-Literature Testimony Business Social All Meetings Science\nANNUAL REPORT\nfour summer work meetings, reducing to 67 per cent the maximum percentage attainable if the topics were used in all work meetings. Tuesday is the traditional Relief Society meeting day, but because of transportation problems incident to the war, many local Societies have found it expedient to meet prior to or in connection with Sunday School. The 1942 annual report indicates that approximately half of the local Societies still meet on Tuesdays, and that the rest meet on other days. Some stakes have reported an increased attendance at the Sunday meetings but the need of careful planning in order to make the most of the more limited time available for Relief Society business and class work. Relief Society work meetings are of course held on a week day.\nRELIEF SOCIETY MEMBERSHIP\nThe number of Relief Society members declined during 1942 from 115,015 to 107,282, a loss of 7,733 or nearly 7 per cent. Two principal factors contributed to this decrease: First, in the preceding four-year campaign for 100,000 members, some women joined the organization who were not genuinely interested. Many of these have since become deeply interested and ardent workers but others have withdrawn their membership. The major factor in the membership decrease, however, is doubtless the changed conditions incident to the war. Thousands of families have moved from their home communities to areas adjacent to war industries. In many instances the women in these families have failed to identify themselves with the Relief Society in their new location, many\n423\nof them because they themselves have taken full-time employment. In view of these conditions, the number of members on record as of the end of 1942 is considered to be a wholesome indication of the genuine and continued interest of the women of the Church in their organization. Although a great many of them are unable to participate fully in the work of the Society under present conditions, they value and retain their membership.\nAn analysis of the total members according to assignments in the Society indicates that as of the end of 1942, 10,851 or 10 per cent were in executive and supervisory positions in wards, stakes, missions, and on the General Board. Class leaders in local Relief Societies numbered 7,732; visiting teachers totaled 29,371, a slight decline of 581 or 2 per cent from the number of visiting teachers in the previous year. Because of its size, this group of visiting teachers is one which would be expected to reflect to greatest extent the effect of increased employment of women, and it is encouraging to find that it has been possible to maintain this large corps of workers with so small a decline. Other workers with special assignments were reported at 4,514, leaving a total of 55,814 other members (52 per cent) without special assignment as of the end of the year.\nAmong those with special assignments are the stake and localrepresentatives who during 1942 increased the paid subscription list to a new high circulation of 56,500 as compared with 55,000 in the previous year. A total of 383 of these Magazine representatives earned a free award subscription\n424\nby procuring subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of the Relief Society membership in their respective local Relief Societies. Even so, only slightly more than half (53 per cent) of Relief Society members subscribe for the Magazine. However, 17,207 or 74.5 per cent of the 23,097 officers and class leaders are subscribers.\nFUNDS EXPENDED\nTotal disbursements of local, stake, and mission Relief Societies and the General Board during 1942 aggregated $462,342.11. Of this amount, $87,882.32 or 19 per cent was spent for charitable purposes, and $374,459.79 for general operating expenses and the Society's educational work. Included in charitable disbursements were amounts issued as direct relief to needy families, payments for health work, and other Relief Society welfare projects. In addition, com--JULY 1943\nmodities with an estimated value of $5,930.89 contributed to the Relief Society, including donations in kind received by visiting teachers were distributed to the needy bringing total charity disbursements to $93,813.21 and total expenditures to $468,273.00.\nIn health work, the Cottonwood Stake Relief Society continued operation of its modern maternity hospital in Salt Lake County and this and several other stakes continued to cooperate with local public health workers in the conduct of clinics for pre-school children, immunization programs, special health education work, and health work of other types.\nTotal net assets of the Society, including cash on hand, wheat trust funds, other invested funds, value of real estate and buildings, furniture and other properties were reported to be $1,348,603.41.\nWAR WORK AND RELIEF SOCIETY\nIn Oakland Stake, California\nWith war conditions changing the habits and ways of living for so many of us, we of the Relief Society are attempting to tie much of our time in with this vital work, thus not only doing some of the necessary volunteer tasks of today, but also keeping women who wish to do war work happy at Relief Society.\nFor instance, we gave forty-eight woolen patchwork quilts to the Red Cross just recently. These quilts were made after our welfare assignment for 1942 had been completed and before we received our 1943 budget. We produced these quilts from scrap pieces left from our reconditioned articles at the stake welfare plant. The batts are of repossessed wool obtained from moth-eaten scraps and hopelessly worn sweaters and swim suits. The scraps were carded for us by a local factory until it was forced into war work. Now we send them to Logan, Utah, to be made into batts.\nWe were able to give the Red Cross six huge boxes of fur scraps to be fashioned into seamen's vests. These scraps were a by-product of our reconditioned clothing project.\nWe urge blood donors and surgical dressing workers to go in groups as Relief Society women rather than as individuals. This procedure actually gets more war work accomplished and at the same time stimulates Relief Society attendance and work.\nIn connection with the drive to put a family first-aid kit in every home, we are advising that each kit contain one or more units of homemade heat. Each unit is about one cubic inch in volume and will produce twenty to thirty minutes of heat equal to five candlepower, giving ample opportunity to boil instruments for sterilization or any other emergency activity. They cost only a fraction of a cent, each being made of old newspaper and paraffin. We have demonstrated the making and use of this heat in our various wards. Ruth S.

Talmage will be completed during the Relief Society educational year 1943-44. There will be eight lessons, the first to be presented the first Tuesday of October 1943, and the final lesson to be presented the first Tuesday of May 1944. The lessons follow the chapters in the book in consecutive order beginning with Chapter 17. The first five lessons deal with the Tenth Article of Faith, the sixth lesson with Article Eleven, the seventh with Article Twelve, and the eighth with Article Thirteen. The subjects by months are as follows:\n* October The Dispersion of Israel\n* November The Gathering of Israel\n* December Zion\n* January Christ's Reign on Earth\n* February Regeneration and Resurrection\n* March Religious Liberty and Toleration\n* April Submission to Secular Authority\n* May Practical Religion\nThe material to be printed each month in the Magazine will consist of three divisions: first, a condensation of each chapter; second, suggested class procedure for the teacher's use; and third, supplementary material quoted from statements of our latter-day prophets, the Presidents of the Church.\nWhile it is believed that most Latter-day Saint families own copies of the Articles of Faith by Talmage, still in order that every class member may familiarize herself with the lesson, a condensation of each chapter with scriptural references will be printed in the Magazine each month as was done for the year 1942-43.\nReports frequently come to the General Board of the enjoyable theological lessons which are presented in the wards. It is the desire of the General Board, however, that not only should the lessons be enjoyable, but also that class members should actively participate in the lessons. One of the best ways to grow is by activity, and through class members participating in a lesson they will grow in knowledge. In order to suggest to the teacher various ways of procuring more active participation in her lesson, the second division of the Magazine material is provided. Under \"Suggestions for Class Procedure,\" each\nPage 429\n430\nmonth a different method will be suggested which is suited to the subject matter under discussion. These suggestions will be simple and any teacher who carefully chooses the class members to participate, with a view to their individual qualifications and needs, will find the suggestions helpful.\nWhen class members are given assignments, it is desirable to allot them a definite length of time in which to present these assignments, impressing upon them the importance of staying within the time limit. Anyone who goes over her allotted time not only takes time away from someone else, but may interfere with the complete development of the lesson as planned by the class leader.\nClass leaders are requested to urge class members to bring with them each theology day the standard works of the Church, and opportunity should be given class members to use these books. This will better familiarize them with the Scriptures, and will encourage home study and class participation. If desired, the class leader might check on the number of Church books brought to class each month by a show of hands, a checking list, or some other simple device.\nThe third division of the Maga--JULY 1943\nzine material, the \"Supplementary Material,\" containing quotations from the writings and statements of the Presidents of our Church, will enrich the lessons. No supplementary material is presented for the first lesson in October on \"The Dispersion of Israel.\"\nClass leaders are advised against controversial discussions on matters which have not been revealed; for example, the whereabouts of The Lost Tribes of Israel. Such discussions waste time and are fruitless.\nThis three-year study of what the Church believes our Thirteen Articles of Faith should be of great benefit to the women of the Church. It should increase their knowledge of the Gospel, enrich their lives, and strengthen their testimonies. We are thankful for the theological teachers in the Relief Society who realize that they can teach nothing except they live what they teach; who appreciate the great responsibility which is theirs to lead their sisters along the path of life and salvation; and who by prayer, by study, and the inspiration of the Lord teach their sisters and encourage them, by participation, to grow in the knowledge of the Gospel. May the Lord bless such teachers in their work, and may they magnify their callings.\nLesson 17 The Dispersion of Israel\n(Tuesday, October 5, 1943)\n(This is the first of five chapters which deal with Article 10)\nArticle 10 \"We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; * * *\"\n431\nLesson Aim: To show how Israel lost its identity as a nation and its freedom as a people for rejecting God, and how the Lord overruled its great losses for the good of the whole world.\nCONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 17, ARTICLES OF FAITH\n(This condensation is placed in the Magazine in the hope that it will result in more class members familiarizing themselves with the lesson.)\nIsrael\nThe combined name and title, Israel, in the original sense of the word, expressed the thought of one who had succeeded in his supplication before the Lord: \"soldier of God,\" \"one who contends with God,\" \"a prince of God,\" are among the common English equivalents. The name first appears in sacred writ as a title conferred upon Jacob, when he prevailed in his determination to secure a blessing from his heavenly visitor in the wilderness, receiving the promise; \"Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\" (Gen. 32:28) But the name of the individual patriarch grew into the designation of a people, including the twelve tribes, who delighted in the title Israelites, or children of Israel.\nAt the death of Solomon, probably about 975 B. C., the kingdom was divided. The tribe of Judah and part of the tribe of Benjamin accepted Rehoboam, son and successor of Solomon, as their king; while the rest of the people, usually spoken of as the Ten Tribes, revolted against Rehoboam, choosing Jeroboam as their king. The Ten Tribes under Jeroboam retained the title Kingdom of Israel, while Rehoboam and his subjects were known as the Kingdom of Judah.\nFor about 250 years the two kingdoms maintained a separate existence; after which, about 721 B. C., the independent status of the kingdom of Israel was destroyed, and the people were brought into captivity by the Assyrians. The Kingdom of Judah was recognized for over a century longer, and then was brought to an end by the Babylonian captivity. For seventy years the people remained in subjection in accordance with the prophecy of Jeremiah. (Jer. 25:11-12; 29:10) Then the Lord softened the hearts of the ruling kings, and Cyrus, the Persian, permitted the Hebrew people to return to Judea and rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The people then commonly known as Hebrews or Jews, retained as the name of their nation the appellation \"Israel,\" though they scarcely comprised two complete tribes out of the twelve. Used in a figurative manner to designate the covenant people who constituted the Church of Christ, (Rom. 9:6; Gal. 6:16) it is still employed in that sense. The Israelites, as first we meet them in history, were a united people.\nThe Dispersion of Israel Foretold\nThe dispersion of Israel was brought about by many stages, and\n432\nextended through millenniums. It was foreseen by the early prophets and the spiritual leaders of every generation.\nBiblical Prophecies\nBiblical prophecies predict blessings beyond the power of the unaided mind of man to conceive, conditioned only upon obedience to the laws of righteousness; and terrible, soul-harrowing, abject misfortune, including the scattering of the people among those who knew not God, if they departed from the path of rectitude. (Lev. 26:14-33; Deut. 28:25-64; I Kings 14:15; Isa. 5:1-7, 13; 10:3; 42:24-25; Jer. 7:12, 15; 9:11; 10:22; 34:17; Ezek. 20:23; 22:15; 34:6; 36:19; Amos 7:17; 9:9; Micah 3:12; Amos 9:9; Zech. 10:9)\nBook of Mormon Predictions\nThe Book of Mormon contains many references to the dispersions that had already taken place, and to the continuation of the scattering. (I Nephi 10:11-13; 13:11-14; 14:14; 15:12-13; 19:12-14; 22:1-4, 7; II Nephi 6:8; 25:14-15; Jacob 5; 6; and many more.) Jesus Himself, after His resurrection, while ministering to the division of His flock on the western hemisphere, refers solemnly to the remnant who were to be \"scattered forth upon the face of the earth because of their unbelief.\" (III Nephi 16:4)\nThe Fulfillment of These Prophecies\nThe sacred scriptures, as well as other writings for which the claim of direct inspiration is not asserted, record the literal fulfillment of proph--JULY 1943\necy in the desolation of the house of Israel. The dividing of the nation into separate kingdoms of Judah and Israel led to the downfall of both. As the people grew in their disregard for the laws of their fathers, their enemies were permitted to triumph over them. The sad fate of the kingdom of Israel had some effect in partially awakening among the people of Judah a sense of their own impending doom.\nSince the destruction of Jerusalem and the final disruption of the Jewish autonomy, the Jews have been wanderers upon the face of the earth, a people without a country, a nation without a home.\nThe Lost Tribes\nThe resurrected Christ, while ministering among the Nephites on this hemisphere, specifically mentioned \"the other tribes of the house of Israel, whom the Father hath led away out of the land\" (III Nephi 15:15); and again He referred to them as \"other sheep which are not of this land, neither of the land of Jerusalem; neither in any parts of that land round about whither I have been to minister\" (III Nephi 16:1). Christ announced a commandment of the Father that He should reveal Himself to them. The present location of the Lost Tribes has not been revealed.\nNote: Since the present location of the Lost Tribes has not been revealed, and since there is a wealth of knowledge that has been revealed, it is advisable that no discussions nor speculations be entered into concerning the present location of the Lost Tribes.\n433\nSUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE\nSuggested Songs\nNote: The class leader might confer with the ward president and the ward chorister and suggest that the following songs be used:\n\"Israel, Israel, God is Calling,\" Latter-day Saint Hymns, page 213.\n\"God Moves in a Mysterious Way,\" Relief Society Songs, page 21, Deseret Sunday School Songs, page 292, Latter-day Saint Hymns, No. 49.\n\"Scripture-finding\" Committee\nSelect a few women to sit around a table in the front of the room, with Bibles, Books of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. Let them find scriptural passages that may be called for in the development of the lesson and have them read these to the class as needed. Of course, every class member should be encouraged to bring her Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants and as the passages of scripture are read, she might turn to her own books and follow the reading. Time allotted for the lesson will not allow for too much scriptural reading; therefore, passages must be carefully selected.\nGeography Report\nAppoint one member to give a very short report of the geography embraced in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and of Assyria, Babylonia, and adjacent countries, to illustrate the captivities of Judah and Israel.\nNote: Many Bibles have small maps. Some of the Seminaries, Sunday Schools, etc., have larger maps of the kingdoms referred to. A large map might be made of wrapping paper and colored crayons.\nHistory Report\nAppoint one member to give a 10-minute historical report covering the period from the division of the kingdom at the death of Solomon to the final dispersion of the children of Israel. (For this information see any good Bible dictionary.)\nChronological Table\nCharts and tables are short cuts, and if used effectively they readily clarify facts, events, or historical happenings covering long periods of time. The chronological table of the Kings of Judah and Israel taken from A Concise Biblical Encyclopedia based on the Cambridge Companion to the Bible, will be helpful in the preparation of this lesson and is found in the back of the Bible used by most Latter-day Saint missionaries.\nPronunciation Guide\nAhijah a-hi'ja Cyrus si'rus Ephraim e'fra-im Euphrates u-fra'tez Hezekiah hez'e-ki'ah Israel is'ra-el Jeroboam jer-o-bo'am Josephus jo-se'fus Josiah jo-si'a Messianic mes'i-an'ik Nebuchadnezzar neb'u-kad-nez'ar Rehoboam re-ho-bo'am Sargon sar'gon, sar'go Sennacherib se-nak'er-ib Shalmanezer shal'man-e'zer Titus ti'tus Vespasian ves-pa'zhi-an Zedekiah zed-e-ki'a Zenos ze'nos\n-JULY 1943\nVisiting Teachers\nMessages to the Home\nSources of Strength\nPreview of Lessons for 1943-44\nONE phase of the Relief Society teaching program is the individual teaching done in the homes by the visiting teachers. This type of teaching can be one of the most effective and impressive ways of teaching, and when properly done, brings excellent results. It follows the pattern of the Master Teacher of all. Jesus talked with individuals; \"he sat with little groups of people engaged in quiet conversation, listening to their remarks, answering their questions, putting them perfectly at their ease, but at the right moment crystalizing the whole discussion into some great guiding truth.\"\nThe visiting teacher has the opportunity of reaching some individuals who do not come under the influence of the class leader who presents a formal lesson in a Relief Society meeting. Her teaching is very informal: she establishes a friendly relationship, finds a common meeting ground by telling a little story, relating an interesting incident, asking a pertinent question or even by requesting a favor that one would be pleased to grant. After this friendly relationship is established, she launches into a discussion of her message through a friendly exchange of ideas or opinions. The hostess is encouraged to talk, and due consideration is given to her ideas. If, for some reason, the hostess is not receptive to a discussion of the subject, a concise and well-formed statement of the message is more effective than a longer presentation. However, the needs of each home differ, and if the visiting teacher offers something that meets a need in the life of an individual, that person will usually listen. The fact that the visiting teacher recognizes the need in a home should not be obvious. If the visiting teacher is sincere, earnest, and prayerful in planning the delivery of the message, she will influence for good the lives of those she visits.\nAt the regular monthly teacher-training meeting the class leader should keep in mind the great objective of the message; and applying her knowledge of the underlying principles of good teaching, she should aid the visiting teachers in their presentation of these spiritual truths in the homes they will visit by a well-prepared discussion of the subject, and by suggestions on how to present this material when making their visits.\n\"Sources of Strength\" has been chosen as the title for the messages to the home during the two years, 1943-44 and 1944-45. There is almost a universal call during this time of disillusionment, sacrifice, and loss of loved ones, for faith and fortitude to carry on valiantly. There is a constant seeking for sources of courage and strength. This course has been planned to supply this need and should be very acceptable in all Latter-day Saint homes.\nFor the ensuing Relief Society educational year 1943-44 the following topics are planned:\n1. A Firm Belief in God As a Source of Strength. Nothing can give the feeling of peace and security and belief in the ultimate triumph of good as does implicit trust in our Heavenly Father. A firm belief in God gives one the courage to live a normal and happy life.\n2. Ordered Living as a Source of Strength. A well-planned life avoids waste of time, inefficiency, and worry. It insures doing the essential things and aids one in maintaining high standards. It is a source of strength.\n3. Freedom of Choice as a Source of Strength. Free agency is a basic principle in man's development. One grows strong by making right decisions for oneself.\n4. The Development of Strength Through Work. Work contributes to health, wealth, and happiness. It is a panacea for many of the ills of life, a release from mental or emotional strain. There is joy in work well done and in the creations of one's own hands and brain.\n435\n5. Cooperation as a Source of Strength. An individual may accomplish very little by himself, but by combining his efforts with others he may become powerful and effective. He must learn to get along with others, to be unselfish, loyal, and considerate, and willing to work for the common good rather than for personal interest alone.\n6. Companionship as a Source of Strength. Everyone needs companions who call forth the best in him, who impart hope, courage, and confidence. Good books may also be inspiring and strength-giving companions.\n7. Loyalty as a Source of Strength. Loyalty is being true to one's best self, to one's ideals, to friends, to country, and to God. It is a primary element in every great and noble character.\n8. Love as a Source of Strength. Love is a divine quality. It enriches and ennobles the individual. Love has great power. The Master asked that man love his enemies and do good to those who despitefully use him.\nLesson 1 A Firm Belief in God\n(Tuesday, October 5, 1943)\nINDIVIDUALS are made strong to endure and to overcome through a firm belief in God. This belief is an unfailing source of comfort and encouragement, a quality much needed in these times. This torn and troubled world needs the assurance that God lives and reigns On High, that He holds in His hands the destiny of men and nations, and in His own time and in His own way He will see that justice is meted out and that righteousness is rewarded. The world needs the assurance that He can hear and answer the appeals of His children; it needs that simple and beautiful faith which enables people to walk with perfect confidence through the mist and shadows of doubt and despair, trusting in the wisdom and goodness of God to lead where the light of reason does not\n436\nalways penetrate; the faith which sees a divine purpose running through the stern and often bitter experiences of life; that sublime faith which sustained Job in the hour of his great affliction and enabled him to say: \"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.\"\nThis faith fortifies and strengthens one in the hour of need. It fills the heart with hope and the will with resolution. Through this faith people have achieved almost superhuman things. The Scriptures abound with examples of it, and history is full of proofs of its powers.\nA Latter-day Saint boy in the United States Navy was asked a question of this import: \"Isn't the Navy the most dangerous field of service?\" He replied that he did not know, and said: \"I've been taught by my mother that the Lord could hear my prayers as well on the water as He could on the land. If I lose my life, it will be in a good cause; and I've always been taught that the next world is a better one than this. So why should I worry?\"\nHow to build up this confidence in the Creator is an important question which has a clear and definite answer. The Lord has declared through His prophets that \"Those-JULY 1943\nwho do the will of the Father shall know of the doctrines.\" This applies to the humblest as well as the mightiest. The only way one can have a perfect knowledge that God lives is through keeping His commandments. The good and great men of the past, the men who have achieved nobly for mankind, have been men with a firm faith in God. Such men were Washington, Lincoln, Joseph Smith and others, leaders of the Latter-day Saints.\nQuestions and Suggestions for Discussion\nIt is suggested that consideration be given to the best ways of presenting this message in the various homes.\n1. How does a firm belief in God give strength to the individual?\n2. Name activities that build faith.\n3. Give examples from the Scriptures of the power of faith; from present-day experiences.\nReferences\nSmith, President Joseph F., Gospel Doctrine, p. 636-643\nTeachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, edition 1938, pp. 56, 148\nRomans 5:1-2; John 14:12, 15, 21; James 1:22-24; 2:14-26; Hebrews 11:6\nHome Topics\nFor optional use on Work-and-Business Day\nModern Housekeeping Methods\nPreview of Lessons for 1943-44\nTHE home topics for optional use on work-and-business day during 1943-44 have been prepared under the general heading \"Modern Housekeeping Methods.\" The objective of the course is to\nbring to the attention of homemakers new and approved methods of housekeeping which will enable them to perform the tasks of housekeeping efficiently with minimum effort, thereby releasing as much time as possible for other activities demanded of homemakers in these abnormal times.\nWomen have been housekeepers since the days of the most primitive homes, but with the changes in the types of homes and improvements in their fittings and furnishings, housekeeping methods have changed and are changing. With homemakers, as with everyone else, it is a healthful attitude to keep an open mind and to appreciate the fact that even though one has followed a certain method of procedure for a long period of time, this does not necessarily indicate it is the best or the only successful method. It is true that there are some fundamentals in every line of endeavor that stand the test of time, but newer and better ways of housekeeping, which conform to changing conditions, are being devised. One should weigh the values of new and different methods, and if they are better than old methods, it is wise to adopt them.\nThe course \"Modern Housekeeping Methods\" is designed as a one-year course. Lessons prepared for the eight months, October 1943, through May 1944, will appear under the following titles:\n1. Budgeting Time Objective: To gain a greater appreciation of the fact that system and order in the home will bring about efficiency with a minimum expenditure of time and energy.\n437\n2. Tools for Housekeeping Tasks Objective: To show the relationship of good tools, conveniently placed for use, and properly used, to efficiency in performing household tasks.\n3. Floors and Floor Coverings Objective: To show that it is a mark of good housekeeping to preserve the appearance and prolong the usefulness of floors and floor coverings by giving each type the special care best suited to it.\n4. Walls, Ceilings, and Woodwork Objective: To show that materials and finishes for walls, ceilings, and woodwork should be selected with an eye to ease of cleaning as well as to beauty, and to suggest special methods for cleaning various types of each.\n5. Seasonal Housecleaning Objective: To show through a discussion of modern methods of housecleaning how this important task can be accomplished efficiently with a minimum of confusion and upset to normal living conditions in the home.\n6. Windows and Window Fittings Objective: To determine the best methods of keeping windows and their fittings, blinds, curtains, screens, and awnings, clean and attractive.\n7. Care of Furniture Finished Wood and Upholstered Objective: To learn the best methods of preserving the beauty and usefulness of furniture, since furniture \"strikes the keynote of the home.\"\n8. Dishwashing Objective: To discuss methods of washing dishes with a view to discovering how this monotonous household task can be done in a sanitary way with rapidity and thoroughness.\nA perusal of the titles and objectives of these eight lessons will indicate the great interest which they\n438\nhold for women. They are all subjects dealing with the everyday experiences of a homemaker and will readily provoke worth-while discussion in the class. The formal presentation of the lesson should be short, followed by the discussion. The recommendations of the General Board stated in blue bulletin No. 21, issued November 11, 1941, is restated herewith: \"It is suggested that the time for formal presentation of the topic not exceed 15 minutes, during which time sewing be suspended, and that presentation be followed by informal discussion and demonstration where desirable, simultaneously with the sewing or other handwork.\"\nOne of the best available sources of reference material is America's Housekeeping Book, compiled by New York Herald Tribune Home In--JULY 1943\nstitute, 1941. This book was recommended for use in connection with Home Topics for 1942-43. Copies are still available at the Deseret Book Store, 44 East South Temple, Salt Lake City; regular price $2.50; price to Relief Society workers $2 postpaid.\nHelpful bulletins and pamphlets may be obtained by writing to state agricultural colleges, county home demonstration agents, or to the Supt. of Documents, Washington, D. C. For example, the Utah State Agricultural College Extension Service has a bulletin entitled \"Practical and Speedy Cleaning Methods\" by Effie S. Barrows, which is very helpful. Theother periodicals, and the daily press frequently have worth-while suggestions. Advertisements in national magazines sometimes contain good suggestions.\nLesson 1 Home Management\nFor optional use on Tuesday, October 12, 1943\nTHESE lessons are written for homemakers. If some suggestions can be made which will increase the interest of homemakers in the management of their homes, helping them to understand their housekeeping problems more clearly and meet them more effectively, the lessons will have served their purpose.\nIt has often been stated that the greatness of America lies not in the granaries filled with corn and wheat, nor in the railroads stretching across the continent, nor in the mighty armies now growing stronger every day. The greatness of America lies in the American home and the family.\nPresident Roosevelt said when we entered the war that we would have to work harder and longer than we had ever done before. This has certainly proved true. Today we have before us such serious problems as a war to win, an army to feed, and a peace to plan. In view of these problems each one of us wants to do the best possible job in adjusting her work to meet wartime conditions.\nCan women plan for more efficiency in their homework in order to make time for added duties? Through better management and cooperation this is possible. If we use the head more and the feet less that is, if we better organize our work and time we will make the time for other things.\nLet's use the Army as an example. Every member of a company has his own housekeeping responsibilities. A schedule is made and followed precisely. The time element is important in each job: making beds on time, cleaning up the rooms, putting away clothing, everything in ship-shape order and on time. No time nor motion is wasted in performing these everyday routine duties. If we would follow this example, our homes would be more efficient and restful, and we would have more time for activities outside the home and more leisure time. In planning our housework we should arrange for each member of the family to have a job and some definite responsibility in the home, whether it be planning the meals or washing the dishes. We should also make a work schedule and assign each household task to a particular day and even the hour of the day when it could be done most quickly and conveniently. The benefits of such a schedule are many: 1. It relieves the uncertainty and nervous strain of never knowing when you'll get things done. 2. It allows more things to be done in a given length of time. 3. It allows planning for leisure pleasures with the comfortable feeling that your housework need not be neglected. 4. It allows planning the work of a parttime helper so that endless repetition of orders is avoided and better help for the money spent is obtained. When a schedule has been followed 439 until it becomes second nature, you run your house it does not run you. How shall we go about making a schedule? _ First write down the jobs that need to be done every day. Next write down the tasks that need to be done on a particular day of the week. Then make a simple weekly chart and assign each job to the day and hour when it can be done most conveniently. (See America's Housekeeping Book, pp. 10, 12.) No two homes are exactly alike, and different conditions affect the work schedule. If there is a small baby, the household schedule must be built around the baby's schedule. Very often little time is left for the countless household tasks, especially if no help is employed; but after all, baby's well-being is of far more importance than any phase of housekeeping, and if some housework has to be neglected or done less thoroughly, this state of affairs should be accepted philosophically. Young children, children of school age, also make it necessary for special adjustments in work schedules. After trying to follow a schedule for a week or more, it is time to check up. Ifa day seems crowded so that it is difficult to do all the work scheduled for that day, there may be a remedy. Here are a few questions that may get to the root of the trouble: 1. Have you tried to do too much in one day? If so, move one or two tasks to less crowded days. 2. Do you know the one best way to accomplish a given task? 3. Do you collect all the material, ingredients, or pieces of equipment that you need for a specific job before you begin? (Example: baking bread, 440 making a cake.) time and steps. 4. Are your housekeeping tools and materials efficient, easy to use, and in good condition? Poor tools slow down work. For example: (a) Is your sink too high or too low for comfort? (b) Is your cleaning equipment right for the jobs to be done? (c) Is your vacuum cleaner or carpet sweeper kept emptied and ready for use? (d) Are your knives sharp? Very important. ) (e) Is the place where the job is to be done, arranged conveniently? (f) Is your kitchen equipment stored at the place where it is used? (g) Is the lighting adequate for the work? (This is very important. ) Are beds set away from the wall so you can make them easily? (i) Is your cleaning closet orderly and well arranged? Can you get things in and out easily? (j) Do you take too long to do a specific job? (Keep a record of the time it takes to do ordinary jobs like dishwashing and making beds.) (k) Are your standards of housekeeping too high? This always saves (This is-JULY 1943 Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Enumerate the values accruing to the housewife from following a work schedule. 2. Relate ways of performing some specific everyday household task that will save time and energy. (Perhaps a demonstration might be arranged.) 3. When would you consider housekeeping standards too high? 4. How may kitchen equipment, such as tables, stoves, sink, refrigerator, etc., be best grouped to save the time and energy of the housewife? (See, \"Highlights In Kitchen Planning,\" Lalene H. Hart, p. 676.) 5. What devices may be employed to adjust working surfaces that are too high? Too low? (See, \"Highlights In Kitchen Planning,\" Lalene H. Hart, p. 679.) 6. Suggest different ways of procuring family cooperation in doing household tasks.

Most folk look upon this Book of Books and rightly so as a sacred volume. \"So far as it is translated correctly,\" it is the word of God. It presents His word, however, in varied impressive forms. Sometimes the divine message is given through straight historical record; at times it comes with directness through commandments; again its spirit is radiated through a beautiful lyric, an ode, a rhapsody; often it is portrayed through an intriguing story LESSON DEPARTMENT or drama or ballad; at other times sublime truths are presented through essays and philosophical discussion; or they may flame forth in divine prophecy. All these forms of literature are to be found in the Bible. First, we shall discover them deftly inwoven in the historical books that portray the story of the chosen people. Literature here is used to illuminate and humanize history. Second, included in the great Book of Books are various books, each devoted to a distinctive type of literature. Thus we have wise sayings in the Proverbs; the songs of Israel in the Psalms; a challenging drama of righteousness in Job; the vision of Zion redeemed in Isaiah. Yet with all this variety of expression, the widely different books and selections that make our Bible are each and all in consonance and harmony with the spirit of the whole. This remarkable unity that magnetizes the varied parts is due to the source of its inspiration. 'Through all the centuries that this sacred volume was being assembled, taught, and finally translated into the tongues of the common folk for their guidance and uplift, one thought was dominant   scribes, rabbis, early Christian fathers and _ translators alike were intent on preserving the word of God. And preserve it they did with remarkable fidelity. 'That was their master service for mankind. In this devotion to a great central ideal, they would seem to have given little heed to literary forms in which the sacred writ was expressed. God's word and will Gospel truth with these inspired leaders was of first concern. Evidence of this truth comes in the form of the Bible as 441 given to us by the translators. Our King James Translation, for example, is cast into a series of chapters, which in turn are broken up into socalled verses. These bits of the sacred writ were intended, we are told, as \"texts for comment\" or for sermons. Not until years after these first translations were made did students of the Bible become concerned with the literary forms of the rare poems, stories, dramas, orations, etc., in the succession of chapters. More recently, under the inspirational leadership of such leaders as the great English scholar, Dr. Richard Green Moulton, who gave us the Modern Reader's Bible, this Biblical literature has been lifted into the clear by being recast into forms that reveal its artistry and enhance its living messages of truth. Studied in the light of the Gospel, this literature will clarify and enrich our knowledge of the Scriptures. It will bring us closer to the inner spirit and true meaning of the Bible. Such is the intent of the lessons of this course. Plainly, it is not possible in a threeyear course of study of Bible literature, such as is being taught in Relief Society, to do much more than open up this rich field of literature. Our purpose, however, will be well served, if those who participate in this work are lured into reading the Bible with new interest and appreciation, valuing it more fully as a literary masterpiece and as the sacred record of the word of God to mankind. An even richer result will come if our mothers respond to the course by sharing its gems of literature through reading them aloud to their children. Herein is a means of sweet companionship with things divine. 'The outline of the eight study units planned for the educational year 1943-44 follows: 1. The Bible Story Concrete study of typical stories from the Bible from a literary viewpoint; their artistry as revealed in plot, characters, local color, language, music and other qualities that mark great literature. Application through story-reading and _ story-telling activities. 2. The Bible Epic Bible stories may be studied individually or in sequence. Frequently, several of these stories, taken together, portray some period of history, such as the stories of the Creation, the Deluge, the Patriarchs, the Exodus. A central purpose of this study is to present such an epic that centering in David the Warrior, King of Israel. Individual stories woven into this epic will be given added interest in light of the whole. 3. The Bible Lyric Study of Bible songs in their storysettings. An inlook into the characteristics of Biblical lyric verse. Its use in expressing heart-throbs of history and rare spiritual emotion. Application through finding and reciting or singing Biblical lyrics. 4. The Bible Ballad Comparative study of prose narrative and poetic story-telling as illustrated in Judges, Chapters IV and V depicting the story and the song of Deborah and her leadership against the enemies of Israel. Application through reading of other Bible narratives enhanced with poetic expression. 5. Bible Wisdom Study of wise sayings to be found in Proverbs and other bits of Biblical wisdom. Some of the brief Biblical essays may be added here as well as excerpts from Ecclesiastes. Application to be made through the choosing and reciting of favorite proverbs and other quotations. 6. A Bible Drama Story of the Book of Job briefly sketched. Its basic message examined. Study of the struggle of Job through testing to the divinely approved outcome. Application through finding some of the literary gems of wisdom voiced by Job in the drama. 7. Bible Oratory Study of the Farewell of Moses as depicted in Deuteronomy, with special attention to the master oration on The Blessing and the Curse its historical and spiritual implications. Application through finding the choice expressions of literature portraying the spirit and message of a great leader to a people delivered from bondage. 8. Bible Prophecy Study of some of the choice parts of Isaiah, with especial attention to the Messianic Hope, and his Rhapsody of Zion Redeemed. Application through reading selections from this \"sunburst of literature,\" and through finding echoes of the Master Book in our own songs and anthems inspired by Isaiah.

            "content": "Relationship of the Relief Society to the Primary\nBy the late May Green Hinckley President of the Primary Association\nTHE relationship of the two organizations, the Relief Society and the Primary, is an intimate and mutual one. Their objectives are almost identical, for each centers in the home. No other organization is so helpful to the Primary Association as the organization whose membership is made up of the mothers of the Church.\nThe Relief Society organization has a program for helping the home builders of the Church, those whose responsibility it is to create the atmosphere and surroundings which mold the characters and fashion the lives of the boys and girls, the men and women of tomorrow. The moral progress of the world rests in a large measure in their hands.\nTo assist the mothers in the transcendent task of training the children is the assignment of the Primary Association. The declared objective of this association is to \"teach the children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord.\" To establish faith in God in their hearts, to teach them respect for the laws of God and of the nation, to teach them obedience to parents and to teachers, to turn their faces to the light of Heaven, and establish their feet in the paths of righteousness are all objectives found in the great work of the Primary Association.\nThe program of this organization brightens the home, strengthens the hands of the parents, and makes a vital contribution to the Church by teaching the everlasting Gospel to the children during their most impressionable years.\nEvery Latter-day Saint mother may look to the Primary organization for specific help with the religious attitude of her children. The four and five-year-old children are taught how to pray, and are helped in their understanding of God. Those who are six years old are given opportunities to show thankfulness and appreciation for God's blessings. For the seven-year-old boys and girls, a course is planned to help them to receive worthily the greatest of all treasures membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As a natural sequence, the eight-year-old children are taught the importance of their membership in the Church and are given the precious lessons from the Master as guideposts for them to follow. The nine, ten, and eleven-year-old children are taught lessons based on the Articles of Faith and are given opportunities to evaluate the principles in their everyday lives.\nIn addition to the basic religious teachings, the girls are given specific training in home building, a religious character-forming, leisure-time activity program which ties directly with the principles for home life as taught in the Relief Society. The boys of the same ages are given a similar program in trail building. In each group a cooperative plan of training intro-\nPage 377\nduces the children to arts and crafts, music, drama, games and play, nature lore and woodcraft, and many other allied arts. Every child who is helped to finish his course in Primary is well equipped with the tools for home, state, and Church citizenship.\nThus, what Relief Society members work for in the adult program, the Primary works for in the child program. Most Primary teachers are members of the Relief Society. They understand and appreciate what the Primary is doing for children.\nWe have not words to express our gratitude to the Relief Society for its cooperation and support. The records of the Primary will show that where the mothers are active in the Relief Society their children are active in the Primary and faithful in their Church duties.\nThe Primary Association will return with compound interest all the support and encouragement the parents can give to it. The Primary Association, with its 20,000 devoted teachers and officers, stands ready to help parents to teach the children of the Church lessons that will serve them throughout their lives.\nEvery effort should be made to have the Primary program fortify the home and reinforce the lessons which Relief Society mothers are teaching in all Latter-day Saint homes. Every effort should be made to strengthen the ties that bind the Primary to the Relief Society."

Glory\" commands our sincerest reverence, claims our deepest love, and inspires our greatest acts of courage. Nations have unfurled their flags since the beginnings of recorded history, and legions have followed their ensigns to greater deeds of courage and valor. \"Terrible as an army with banners,\" said King Solomon over three thousand years ago. The Star-spangled Banner has a diversified and fascinating history and it is particularly fitting at this time, when the flag is so prominent in our national spotlight, that we learn more of its history. Many flags, both of this and other nations, flew over this land before the stars and stripes, as we know it today, was finally adopted. Columbus unfurled the colorful banner of Spain when he landed on the island of San Salvador in 1492. The orange, white, and blue flag of the Dutch Republic flew over the colony of New Netherland for fifty years, until an English fleet replaced it in 1664 with the cross of St. George and gave the colony the name of New York. In 1535, Jacques Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence and formally claimed its entire valley in the name of the King of France. When James of Scotland succeeded Queen Elizabeth on the English throne, he created the Union flag by - uniting the red cross of St. George on its field of white with the white cross of Scotland's St. Andrew on Page 386 its field of blue, and it was this flag that waved over the struggling colonies of Jamestown and Plymouth. Not only was it the first flag to fly over the homes of English-speaking people in America, but its colors of red, white, and blue lived on to become the permanent colors of the flag of the United States. It was the Union flag that led Washington's struggling army of Virginians to battle at Fort Necessity in 1754, it waved above the successful colonists in the defeat of Braddock, and it replaced the flag of France at Detroit in 1760. Although the Union flag was the chief standard of the American colonists for a great many years, they soon began to create individual flags expressive of their particular localities and interests. Among the best known of these was the pine tree flag of Massachusetts, which towards the close of the colonial period became known as the \"Liberty Tree\" and bore the legend \"An Appeal to Heaven.\" Another symbol which was employed in a variety of design in New England was the rattlesnake flag with the warning words, \"Don't Tread On Me.\" New York fashioned a flag with a black beaver on a white background, and Rhode Island's white flag had the word \"Hope\" above a blue anchor. There was no common standard furled over the heads of the fighting colonists when the fires of the Revolutionary War flared into full blaze. As one historian says, \"The only common flag the Colonists had was the one they were fighting against,\" THE STORY OF OLD GLORY but among the many banners that floated over the various companies were a number that could easily have been forerunners in design for our present stars and stripes. Among these was the flag of the Philadelphia Light Horse Troop which escorted General Washington to New York to assume command of the army and which bore in its center a knot tied with thirteen cords flanked by thirteen blue and silver stripes. The first flag to be generally adopted by the united colonists was known as the Grand Union flag and was flown from a seventy-six-foot flagstaff on Prospect Hill in Somerville, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1776. It is not known who designed the flag but, oddly enough, it contained the Union Jack of the mother country in the canton together with the thirteen red and white stripes still used in our national banner. It continued in use until nearly a year after the signing of the Declaration of Independence when it was superseded by the stars and stripes. ITH the signing of the Declaration of Independence, all allegiance to Britain was broken and the symbolic crosses of the Grand Union flag became obsolete. Nevertheless, Congress was painstakingly slow in proceeding to create a new flag. It was not until June 14, 1777 that Congress, convened at Philadelphia, in the midst of numerous items of petty business passed the simple resolution, \".... That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\". Thus without fanfare 387 or ostentation the stars and stripes was born. Just as the Great Union flag had been created by the simple procedure of adding six white stripes to the field of England's flag, the new national banner was made by substituting the thirteen white stars on a field of blue for the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew. In this manner the union of the thirteen colonies was doubly portrayed, both by the stars and the stripes. 'There was no definite design provided at this time, and the matter of what proportions the field should be, or how the stars should be arranged was left entirely up to the fancy of the seamstresses who fashioned the various flags. Dr. M. M. Quaife in his book The Flag of the United States says, \"We seek in vain for any recorded explanation of this cavalier procedure but it seems obvious that the reverence which all Americans today pay to their flag was foreign to the minds of the men of 1777. A flag was essential to the conduct of warfare between ships at sea, and the Congress met the need by prescribing in general terms the new design. It is obvious that their actions were animated by the practical need and but slightly, if at all, by sentiment for the new banner; nor need we wonder at this, for in the beginning it was not hallowed by the associations and the sacrifices of more than a century and a half which all present-day Americans instinctively associate with it.\" Congress in adopting the emblem had assumed that there would be only thirteen permanent states. Rapid expansion to the west and south soon brought about a national change 388 of mind in this regard, however, and in 1781 Congress adopted a resolution pledging that new states would be admitted to the Union enjoying equal privileges with the original ones. Vermont and Kentucky were already well settled and when they became the 14th and isth states of the Union, it was soon apparent that something had to be done about the flag. In 1793 a resolution was presented to Congress suggesting that the flag be changed to contain fifteen stars and fifteen stripes and the Senate nonchalantly passed the bill; but the House arose in indignant debate and one member \"thought it a trifling business which ought not to engross the attention of the House when it was their duty to discuss matters of infinitely greater importance.\" He said, \"If we are to alter the flag from thirteen to fifteen stripes with two additionel stars because Vermont and Kentucky have been added, we may go on add-. Ing and altering at this rate for one. Hundred years to come. It is likely that before fifteen years shall elapse we Shall consist of 20 states. The flag ought to be permanent.\" After considerable _ bickering wherein the members of the House freely expressed themselves that the bill was not worth all the trouble and waste of time it was causing, they passed the bill, in order to get rid of it; and thus the second flag of the United States became one of fifteen ted and white stripes. - It was our national banner for nearly a quarter of a century, led our soldiers through three wars, and flew over Fort McHenry on the night of September 13-14, 1814 when Francis Scott Key-JULY 1943 watched through the rockets' red glare to learn the fate of the Starspangled Banner. This lack of regard for or even interest in the flag can be understood when it is remembered that as yet we were not a strong nation bound by ties of loyalty and tradition. We were but a group of struggling and loosely-bound states far more concerned about individual governments than about the nation as a whole. In the same manner our national anthem attracted but little interest when it first appeared in print, and it was not until the time of the Civil War that it began to attain its present place in the affection of the American people. After the war of 1812 there was a considerable improvement in the unity of feeling existing between the states and a tremendous upsurge in our sense of national pride. By 1816 there were five additional states in the Union but no provisions had been made for displaying this increase in the commonwealth upon the flag. The matter was brought up in Congress by Peter H. Wendover and it was largely due to his persistent efforts, over a period of two years, that a permanent design for the flag was finally adopted. Members of Congress argued that it was impractical to add additional | stripes for each new state and that the number should be reverted back to the original thirteen stars and stripes. As everyone knows, a compromise was finally effected, in 1818, whereby the number of stripes was placed at thirteen for the original colonies while a new star was added for each new state until forty-eight (Continued on page 392)"

            "content": "Short-story Writing Pearl Spencer Department of English, Logan Senior High School WHEN is a short story not a short story, but a sketch, a tale, or an incident? 'This is the question which many an aspiring author ruefully asks herself as her lovingly-wrought manuscript comes back with a kindly note praising the spirit, perhaps the style, but pointing out that it doesn't quite qualify as a short story. The question is particularly difficult to answer in view of the fact that many modern writers, inspired by Chekhov and moved by an increasing interest in social conditions rather than the individual, have written memorable stories which have certainly not followed the rules laid down by Poe, and which seem to some readers not to be short stories at all. But re-examination of the great pieces of short fiction in the modern manner will show that they possess the central purpose and discernment that provide the one essential feature of the short story  unity. Assuming unity to be the necessary element of the short story, it can be seen that the followers of the Russian writers are not so much at variance with Poe's standards as many readers have thought. The difference, after all, seems chiefly one of technique, not of intent. For Poe's great purpose, you will remember, was to create a single, strong, emotional expression on his readers. He laid down the rules by which, it seemed to him, such an impression might best be made. If other methods can do the same, he would probably be the last to object. He would also agree that too many of his followers had become mechanics rather than artists, and that new ways of writing might give new life to the craft. Just as these literary mechanics, turning out vast numbers of short stories with \"interchangeable parts,\" as one critic phrased it, discredited Poe's formula among some writers, so it is the second-rate writers, without genuine purpose or literary discipline, who have given the modern short story the reputation of being formless. As a result, many of us have the idea that we may describe our eccentric neighbor's vagaries or the desolate family camped beside the highway, and call the result a short story. The essential unity of the short story is achieved by the selection of _a struggle in which the characters of the story are engaged, and in picturing or predicting the outcome of this struggle. The struggle may be man (or woman) against the perils of intrigue, the elements, war, or enemies  and we have the adventure story; against his rivals the love story; against his material handicaps the success story; his weaknesses the moral story; the universe the religious story; his personality the psychological story; his environment  the story of social consciousness. This last, especially, has widely extended Page 389 390 the conception of what constitutes a dramatic struggle. Whatever the theme and method a writer chooses, it is his treatment of this struggle that determines the unity of his story. Its significance must be shown. It must be followed to an inevitable, clear-eyed conclusion. Accident and coincidence may hasten or precipitate the conclusion, we are told, but they must not determine it. That must be inherent in the characters and circumstances. And it is well to remember that it is not the unique situation or the dramatic denouement that brings a readerback to certain stories time and time again. It is the way in which the struggle unfolds that makes some stories immortal; that magic by which they still keep us tingling with suspense even after we know them almost by heart. This matter of resolving the conflict and getting everything ended neatly and satisfactorily is not so difficult if one chooses a struggle where the outcome is a matter of a lifetime of happiness or unhappiness, and the issues are clearly defined and capable of solution. Writing then becomes chiefly a matter of working tremendously hard to carry the reader along, in rapt attention, toward the end of the struggle, the solution of the plot. But what of the minor dramas that the sensitive participants in life see about them every day? What of those struggles whose very poignancy lies in their being unending? What of the heroism that is all the greater for being unheralded and unsung? What of those daily choices we make, no one of which is in itself of decisive importance, but which-JULY 1943 add up inevitably to our destinies? Are these not the stuff of literature also? They are indeed, and they are a rich source of material for the beginning writer, not only because we can interpret best the things we know and love, but for the very practical reason that there is a great interest in such material at the present time. If the interest is waning, as it may be, the only ones to blame are the writers who have surfeited us with formless uninterpreted, usually gloomy sketches in the name of the \"new\" short story. For, first of all, such material must be given form. If the nature of a man's life is to be revealed, and his never-ending, but brave struggle with poverty is to be shown, then certain incidents, complete in themselves, must be carefully chosen and highlighted. Second, the significance of these events must be made clear. It has been pointed out that the writer of a short story can't develop his characters as completely as a novelist does, but that he has to know them just as well in order to reveal them by lightning flashes, as it were. Too many writers of the \"slice of life' school don't know their characters any better than any casual observer might, and reveal no more of the significance of their lives. Somerset Maugham warns us that whenever a story has no more significance than a recital of facts, the danger point has been reached. Third, the occurrences which one chooses must illumine the past and predict the future inexorably. This requirement is imposed upon the writer of this kind of story even more sternly than upon the author who SHORT-STORY WRITING creates'a more formal plot within whose outline the story has its being. The choice of incident must, in a brief space, add up in effect to a lifetime. Read Dorothy Parker's \"Clothe the Naked\" as an example of this kind of story. The writer of the story which does not rely upon a decisive climax and outcome, usually imposes a fourth obligation upon himself. Very often such a story becomes compelling only as it is felt to be somehow typical of large numbers of the same sort of people. Much of the reader's pleasure comes from his sense of recognition. Every writer, as Miss Edith Ronald Mirrielees points out, needs the capacity for \"making the story's figures stand clear as individuals and yet cast shadows larger than the individual.\" 'This capacity is particularly essential in the story whose characters interest and appeal because they are typical rather than individual. PROBABLY nothing could do the cause of the pioneer story* more good than for numerous writers to turn with determination to strongly plotted stories with gripping situations, authentic personal struggles, and dramatic, triumphant climaxes. Such stories would be fit vehicles to reveal the noble, dignified, yet intensely human pioneer men and women (particularly the women), who so seldom have been adequately dealt with in the short story. Weare not obligated to show the epic significance of the entire pioneer 391 trek everytime we write of pioneer life as so many have seemed to feel. But we are obligated, whenever we write a short story of pioneer days, to produce a firm narrative with an honestly defined struggle. It should be a story that will stand on its own feet and create a response in the reader, rather than depending upon his already established responses to make it effective. 'This rather lazy dependence upon the sympathetic attitude of the reader has made too many of our pioneer stories lack appeal for \"outsiders\" or our own members to whom the sight of a handcart, for example, does not bring the strong emotional response that it does in most of us. No greater service could be done our young people than to provide them with stirring, genuinely moving fiction which would help create an understanding attitude toward the pioneers. Instead, much of our fiction assumes that such an admiring, understanding, and reverent attitude already exists, and the symbols of pioneer life the handcart, the _ trail-side grave will in themselves give a story emotional power. They are genuinely meaningful symbols, and our grandfathers' diaries are full of enough characters and situations, color and meaning, to provide grist for our mills for as long as Daniel Boone has done, but it's our task to give them new form, new life, and new meaning for a new generation. Because such a wealth of source material on pioneer days exists, many people have assumed that pioneer *Special instruction is given in this article on the writing of pioneer stories because a need is recognized for direction in this type of short-story writing. The General Board does not, in any way, desire to encourage the writing of pioneer stories more than other types of fiction. 392 stories should be easy to write. Writers know that they are not. A satisfactory, clearly defined struggle is hard to set up in a pioneer story, save in matters of hardships and privation; for the united struggle of the pioneers against their common protagonists always seems more characteristic than their individual struggles and problems. It is hard not to blur the unity with too much explanation. It is difficult not to intrude a moral instead of letting the characters convey their own message. We are not allowed the same range in satisfactory endings; therefore we must often work much harder to create suspense and charm in the way in which the story progresses to its conclusion. Because we are truly 'a peculiar people,\" we are even more false in our premises than most historical writers if we assume the plausible untruth that \"people have always been the same\" and interpret the pioneer sense of values accordingly. The premises upon which their sense of values were built are difficult to explain and difficult-JULY 1943 to take for granted as motivations. We have to be especially careful, as we try to appeal to the present generation, not to lose contact with the real spirit and real thinking of the pioneers. 'This requires constant, intimate, understanding contact with original source material. How impossible it is to interpret the pioneers without having imbibed deeply of their spirit and convictions is illustrated by the many scholarly and factually accurate studies which are still entirely false and valueless as interpretations of their lives. For any story of plot, Poe's formula is still the best in the world, and every writer, of course, knows his analysis by heart. Certainly no one can safely diverge from it until his sense of form is sure. Somerset Maugham sums Poe up thus: \"It [the short story] is a piece of fiction, dealing with a single incident, material or spiritual, that can be read at a sitting; it is original, it must sparkle, excite, or impress, and it must have unity of effect or impression. It should move in an even line from its exposition to its close.\" THE STORY OF OLD GLORY (Continued from page 388) in all blazed forth upon the blue field. In December 1942 by Act of Congress, a slight change was made in the manner of presenting the pledge to the flag. In place of extending the arm, as formerly, the hand now remains over the heart during the entire time that the pledge is repeated, and is not dropped until after the final word \"all.\" Bibliography Quaife, M.

The present problem is one of impressing a larger percentage of American housewives with the importance of saving and turning in their waste household fats and greases. A consumer study made by the Office of War Information in January 1943, shows that while 92 per cent of housewives are familiar with the program and 74 per cent understand the procedures, to be followed, only 59 per cent were saving kitchen fats and only 31 per cent had actually turned them into their meat dealers.

Fortunately, however, some good comes of war. Like a refiner's fire, frequently it burns out the dross of human selfishness, leaving gold ingots of devotion, nobility, heroism. A task worthy of every woman's consecration is to carry into the post-war world virtues learned through today's vicissitudes, such as: the joy of having children (last year's birthrate in America doubled that of 1941, and this year's will be higher); the value of marriage and a home (half the girls in one war production plant admit they are hoping and saving for a home); the steadying power of physical work; the experiences of budgeting; the gratifications of practicing thrift; and the immense economy of cooperation, in home, community, national, and international life. War teaches us the comfort of faith in God; the necessity of human brotherhood; the fact that suffering can make us a little more God-like in comprehension. These are lessons to remember.

Happy the child, the youth, and the man or woman to whom the word \"father\" recalls a series of recollections brimming with the loving care and kindness bestowed upon him by his father. To such a person, memory reaches back to earliest years and treasured childhood experiences. These will vary, but how often, perchance, will one of these incidents be centered about the bedside of the sick, as the family kneels in prayer and the father, exercising one of his greatest prerogatives as the bearer of the Holy Priesthood, invokes the healing power upon the sick. Mingled with such important and sacred memories will be ones of a lighter nature, ones in which the father figures as a veritable mine crammed full of pennies and nickels, a haven of last resort in crucial times of need. A trip taken with a father always remains a bright and cherished mem-  W ordsworth. Ory. It may have been to a large city where it seemed that all the alluring and enchanting sights and sounds in the world were spread out before one's wondering gaze. One such trip to New York is recalled. Each morning one was awakened by father standing in the doorway of the hotel bedroom and quoting, \"The bird of time has but a little way to fly and lo, the bird is on the wing.\" This reminder of the fast fleeting magic days worked as a charm! Associated with that special trip are recollections of a visit to the lower east side in order that a wholesome home might the better be appreciated; the wonders of the Hippodrome where the horses disappeared under the water; the magic of the Automat where one put in a nickel and food appeared in as wonderful a manner as any fairy tale; luncheon at the Astor with Hazel Dawn; and two trips to the Metropolitan to watch with fascinated eyes the dancing of Nijinski and the Russian Ballet. Golden pages from the book of memory of a father's kindness and generosity! Another happy recollection of a holiday spent with father is of a mountain camping trip which remains a vivid picture for two reasons: first, for the discovery that father was a good cook; and second, a not-so-pleasant Poge 397 remembrance of flesh gained from eating his skillet-bread. As one grows older, one more and more becomes conscious of the watchful and constant care evidenced by a father as the guardian of his children. Pitfalls and dangers are pointed out and all one's friends and associates are closely scrutinized. One feels at times that his premonitions and insight are too acute to be comfortable, but gradually as one's outlook broadens, his wisdom is recognized and his advice is followed with a better grace. His justice and fairness stand out as prominent traits, and his encouragement and understanding are ever sources of strength. One comes to turn to him more and more for counsel and in following it, one's life takes on a righteous pattern. After marriage, when one's husband becomes the father of one's children, then the cycle is completed. In noting the tender, constant, and great love manifested by a young father toward his babies and young children, one's appreciation for fatherhood is increased, and thanksgiving to the Lord wells up in one's heart for fathers such as these fathers who will be our fathers not only here but throughout time and all eternity as well.

Dear Mr. Hays: As a young mother and an American citizen interested in the welfare of our youth, I protest the great and unnecessary use of alcohol and tobacco in motion pictures. In addition to holding up before young people false standards and ideals, so much drinking and smoking by their heroes and heroines, I believe, represents the characters falsely. I refer specifically to such pictures as The Thin Man series wherein Nick Charles drinks incessantly, and continually puffs on a cigarette and yet always is up to solving the crime brilliantly. People I have known who drink and smoke to an extreme are not lovable individuals and are not worth two cents in an emergency. It is my sincere hope in writing you that action can be taken to eliminate an evil which has a far-reaching effect upon the lives of our young people. Yours very truly, (Signed) Mrs. Helen A.

            "content": "Tch! Tch! Grandma! Olive W. Burt O all outward appearances, this summer morning was just like all the others. The family sat crouched behind wide-spread newspapers, reaching out groping hands for buttered toast and orange slices. Grandma, alone in her little newspaper-walled world, found plenty to do, keeping food within reach of those bodiless hands. Yes, it did seem just like all other mornings. Breakfast over, the girls rose and stretched and moved into the living room. Judith turned on the radio and curled up in a big chair with a mystery story; Patty sat down and began to do her nails; their mother puttered about with the house plants, and their father dashed out of the house, in his usual rush to get to work. \"It's a lovely day, isn't it?\" Jessica asked without looking up from the _geranium from which she was plucking dried leaves. \"I think I'll try to get a few moments to knit on that afghan I've been doing for the Red Cross for the past six months.\" Grandma began to clear the table. In the wrinkled old face the blue eyes were alive and young with resentment. She had thought maybe today would be different. She had done what she could to change it, but apparently it was of no use to try. She scraped the dishes and piled them high in the sink. Dishes! Grandma's stomach contracted with distaste. How many millions of dishes had she done in her lifetime? She had begun wrong, she guessed, being born the youngest girl in a big family. Her first job had been to wash dishes while her older sisters did all the exciting things like making cakes and cookies and gingerbread, unrestrained in their efforts, because they knew Mary would have to do the dishes they stacked up. Then she had married, and there were dishes three times a day. Dishes and babies. There had been a half respite in the years after the children were grown and married, when Frank had been there to help her after every meal. Then he had gone on and she had come to live with Jessica, and do dishes. This was all they thought she was good for, all of them. Let her go for a visit to John's or to Joseph's or Agatha's, and the dishwasher took a vacation. The telephone rang. Book, nail polish, flowers scattered to the four winds as the family made a dash for the phone. Patty got there first. The inviting smile was wiped from her face as she dropped the receiver and said listlessly, \"It's for you, Grandma.\" Patty returned to her nails. Grandma came slowly to the telephone. She hoped the family wouldn't notice her eagerness. She picked her answers carefully, mostly monosyllables; \"Yes. Yes? Tomorrow? Yes. All right.\" She went back to the kitchen. The dishes were still distasteful, but Grandma wasn't thinking about them now. She turned on the water\nPage 399\n400\nand sprinkled the soap powder into it. It fluffed up. The phone rang again. \"It's for you again, Grandma!\" called Patty. The family wasn't curious yet, but if they had been they wouldn't have heard a great deal. The third time they had to call to her, though, they did listen, and when the fourth voice asked for Mrs. Sheldon there was frank impatience and curiosity in their faces. \"What is it, Mother?\" Jessica asked, but Grandma just said breezily, \"A little war work I'm trying to do.\" There was no use to try to pry further. If Grandma wanted to talk, nothing could stop her; but if she didn't want to talk, well, nothing could start her. Jessica was pretty sure it was some doubtful project, but she'd hear about it sooner or later. Grandma went into the kitchen, took off her apron and hung it up. Then, with pencil and notebook she sat down near the telephone. \"You aren't going to keep the phone all day, are you?\" asked Judith. \"I'm expecting a call.\" \"So am I!\" answered Grandma tartly. \"Your friends will have to take the same chance mine do.\" It must have been an hour later that Patty went into the kitchen for something. \"Why, Grandma!\" she cried, \"The dishes aren't done!\" \"Aren't they?\" asked Grandma sweetly. \"You know they're not!\" Patty was accusing.-JULY 1943\n\"I didn't know anything about it. I know I didn't do them,\" Grandma went out of the room and up the stairs. Jessica looked at her daughters. \"Something must be wrong with Grandma,\" she said. \"You girls better do the dishes this morning.\" It wasn't as simple as that, but the dishes were finally done. About that time Grandma came downstairs, hatted and coated, and stepping spryly along. \"Where are you going, Grandma?\" asked Jessica sharply. \"To work,\" said Grandma, and opened the door. Then she turned back. \"I am willing to pay for my board and room, Jessica, now that I've got a job that pays me,\" she said. \"Or I can go somewhere else to live if you'd rather. I've had two offers of a home this morning with pay! I didn't take them, but I can. I am going to work now, everyone else is working but you and the girls, and as your part of the war effort, you can do your own dishes!\" She shut the door sharply and walked briskly down the street. Jessica looked bewildered. \"Grandma, of all people!\" said Judith. \"And what kind of job can she get, an old woman like that!\" \"Oh,\" said Patty slowly, \"One of the women this morning said something \" she grabbed the morning paper and rifled the pages, stopping to study one intently. \"Yes, here it is!\" She read aloud: \"Elderly woman in excellent health and fond of children would like to care for babies of defense workers. Day work preferred. Dial 6-4220. Mrs. Sheldon,\"\nTomorrow's Cup\nAnna Prince Redd\nChapter IV\nSynopsis: Janet, protectingly reared in Washington, D. C., lives in constant dread of the San Juan country of Utah where her husband, Paul Morgan, has an Indian trading post on the mesa. She plans on their moving to Washington before the birth of her baby, but does not disclose this intention to her husband. Upon returning home with Paul after a happy week spent on the mesa, they find that Janet's sister, Rhae, and her husband Warren Newsbaum, have arrived for a short visit with the announced intention of taking Janet back to Washington with them. The next morning Paul is hurt when he saves Warren from being dragged by a broncho.\nExcept for Juanee, there wasn't a soul within fifteen miles of the trading post. Paul, Indian Joe, Juanee's husband, and the rest of the ranch outfit were out on the winter range getting ready for the spring roundup. An open winter and months of warm rains had kept the range in good shape; cattle were rolling fat; steers would be ready for the market weeks ahead of time. Paul had little time for anything else. But being alone had long since ceased being a terror to Janet. There was so much to be done before the coming of the baby that she had no time for worry or unpleasant thoughts. Even the country seemed less appalling. Since the day, months ago, when Caesar had almost killed Paul, she had known she could never leave El Toro unless Paul came, too. There would never again be any doubt of that, but she still clung to the thought that someday she would win him away. But now, after the long slow months of his recovery, Paul seemed more entrenched than ever. As soon as he was well enough to be out on the range again, he had plunged into an orgy of buying and selling that frightened her. If he became too involved, he would be less easily uprooted; less inclined to turn things over to an overseer as she meant him to do. Seeing him lying there with broken bones and helpless, idle hands, she had said over and over again that only his life mattered. Where she lived or what she did was unimportant. She smiled, now, at the thought of how Rhae and Warren even the nurse and the specialist that Warren had imported to care for Paul had conspired to get her to terminate what they called her self-inspired martyrdom, using her condition as the hatchet over her head. \"I'll go to a hospital if Paul is well enough to go with me,\" she had promised them, and nothing they could say had changed her mind. \"I could have a specialist come here, couldn't I? Just as you came to Paul, Dr. Meade.\" \"Having a baby out of a hospital is impossible!\" Rhae cried indignantly. \"Father would not hear of such a thing. Mother always had the best hospitals.\"\nPage 401\n402\n\"Yet mother died.\" Janet replied softly. \"And Juanee was confined right here in her hogan back of El Toro and nothing happened at all.\" Then brightly: \"Except that she presented the reservation with its first twins in fifty years!\" \"You make me sick!\" Rhae scorned. \"How can you talk like that? You'd think you were a common common \" \"Squaw? Or one of the dozens of fine women I know here in the desert?\" Janet was positively delighted at the strength of her own arguments. She had almost believed them herself! Thinking of it now it didn't seem so funny. She'd go to a hospital of course. Paul wouldn't hear of anything else, they'd planned that as soon as they were alone, and he was well enough to sit out in the patio and talk. But, though Paul was coming home to go to Washington with her, she didn't want to go at all. She sighed. El Toro was so lazy and comfortable. Facing the old life again after nearly four years of isolation, was a bit terrifying. She'd probably shy from a train as range horses did from an automobile! And she didn't even have fashionable clothes. But that, too, was easily remedied. With money to burn if she wanted it, she could buy to her heart's content. Juanee came in with a log for the fire. Janet held up the tiny dress she was embroidering. \"How does that look, Juanee? Isn't it adorable?\" \"It is too white. It is too small. My twin boys would spoil that in one minute. Mister Paul will be home tonight. He will say you should buy Levis for a boy!\"-JULY 1943\n\"Yes, he would. He has named the child already. It's to be Jerry. I call him Paul.\" \"You better start thinking up names in case a girl comes.\" \"Juanee, don't you go predicting a girl. Paul would be devastated.\" \"But you love what comes. Huh? Mister Paul, too.\" \"You're a great comfort, Juanee. You have better sense than most women.\" Juanee smiled broadly. \"Miss Janet nice woman, too!\" Janet laughed. \"Thanks Juanee. How are the twins? Do they like being at the school?\" \"Not now. Soon they will, just like their papa and mama did. Are we not warm and comfortable here with you because of the school? My begays will learn to like the school.\" \"It must be grand to have twins!\" \"Oh, yes! You like to have twins?\" Janet laughed in surprise. \"Oh, no, Juanee. One is all I could manage. I'd be scared to death of two!\" \"You have two big loves or one big love. You give me two dollars or one dollar, I take two dollars!\" Juanee brushed the last spark from the hearth and went back to her work.\nA car wheezed into the yard and Janet knew Dr. Potsworth had come to make his weekly call. He was a lovable, shrewd old man, and a valuable doctor. She knew he'd like to officiate at her child's birth, here at El Toro, just as he'd brought hundreds of other babies into other homes, without fuss or bother. She'd a notion to take him along to Washington with her when she went to the hospital.\nTOMORROW'S CUP\nThe thought conjured up such a picture of Rhae's horror at sight of the fat, bewhiskered little man, that Janet laughed aloud. \"Fine, Janet, fine!\" Dr. Potsworth exclaimed, coming in at the door. \"I wish I had a strong, healthy girl like you to be mother to the one that's coming in the trapper's hut down on the river. She's a puny little thing. No spirit. No spirit at all!\" When the doctor had gone, Janet sat thinking of what he had said. She knew that \"puny little thing down on the river.\" A slip of a girl who had never known hardship until she married a man of her family's choosing, a Frenchman of many promises and good looks. They had finally, after years and years of poverty and hardship, come to this. The trapper's wife was the one that should be going to the big hospital, the good food, and the white-clad nurses! This country had broken her spirit as it had her lovely little body. Just as it broke others, stronger than herself! Janet's peace was gone. The floodgates were raised, letting her emotions tumble pell-mell over each other. All the fears she had accumulated crowded in with renewed force, stronger for their enforced idleness. \"Spirit!\" Janet stood up angrily. \"Poor little trapper's wife. She hasn't a chance! Oh, if Paul only knew how I hate, how I \" Taos woke abruptly. Not, Janet could see, from anything she had done, but from uneasy intuition. He sniffed the air and went toward the door. Janet followed and opened it, letting him out. For a minute she could see nothing to be excited\n403\nabout, and was about to draw the dog inside and close the door, when a horseman came up over a ridge to the east. Janet hugged herself against the damp wind, debating whether to go in or wait. Long before she could see the rider clearly, she knew it was an Indian. Only lithe, bareback riders have that motionless grace. No flapping of arms or legs, no body motion except the rhythm of balanced posture. \"See, Taos, it's only an Indian begay a boy.\" Janet was as calm as if it had been one of Juanee's twins. Taos continued to growl. Juanee came to the door and stood by Janet. \"That's Mike's begay,\" she said. \"He's a no good boy!\" \"What does Mike's begay want?\" Janet demanded the minute the boy slid from his horse. \"I come here.\" He pointed to Juanee, and after that he talked rapidly in Navajo, ignoring Janet entirely. Janet was more piqued than she cared to admit. Why hadn't she taken the trouble to learn Navajo. Mike's begay had shifty eyes, and she didn't like the way he peered into the rooms behind her. She gave Taos a tug on his collar and drew him reluctantly, inside, closing the door after him. The minute they were left alone, Juanee's voice became suspicious, low-pitched; the Indian boy's more persuasive. Janet listened nervously. It was silly to imagine things every time anyone came on the place. Yet why was it that as soon as Paul went away, even for a day, every renegade on the reservation seemed to know it, and to take advantage of his absence. Nowhere was there a more crafty In-\n404\ndian than Mike, and his boy looked equal to his breed. Perhaps she had cause to feel nervous. Juanee came in. \"My mother is very sick,\" she said. \"Mike's begay says she will die. She wants me to come.\" Her voice was so filled with a mixture of doubt and anguish that she could hardly speak the words. \"But you just came home from your father's hogan, Juanee,\" Janet protested. \"Your mother was not sick then!\" \"That is what I cannot understand. But the begay brings this to make me know.\" Juanee held up an exquisite silver cross, set with turquoise. \"My mother say she keep this until she die, then it is for me. That is how I know that Mike's begay does not lie.\" \"You must go at once, Juanee,\" Janet said, sorry for even a moment's doubt of the Indian woman's faithfulness. \"But I cannot leave you, Miss Janet!\" \"Of course you can. I'm perfectly well, and Mr. Paul will be home tonight.\" Juanee shook her head mournfully, looking first at the Indian boy, waiting, astride his horse, then at her mistress. Janet noted her uneasiness and it increased her own. But there was no help for it. Juanee must go to her people. \"You must go, Juanee,\" she urged. \"Send your cousin Myrrup back to stay with me if it will make you feel easier. Now hurry!\" Juanee hesitated, clutching the silver cross. She went to a desk, took out a small pistol, held it up significantly, and placing it on the mantel above the glowing fire, said: \"Mr.-JULY 1943\nPaul taught you to use this, Miss Janet; he know someday you may need to shoot very straight!\" Janet laughed nervously. \"I'll scare the daylight out of anyone who bothers me,\" she boasted, \"so please hurry!\" Under her breath she added, \"Before I weaken.\" \"May the Father of my people remember to walk by this house,\" Juanee said, and, turning, went out. A few minutes later she rode around the corner of the house on her own horse, and was gone, one twin in her arms, the other blanketed to her back. The Indian boy rode after them across the flats. Taos strained at his collar, but Janet held him in. \"It's all right, Taos,\" she assured him. \"Come and lie down by the fire.\"\nShe sewed for an hour, watching Taos between times. \"Why don't you go to sleep?\" she said finally. \"You make me nervous with your watching.\" Taos thumped his tail but remained attentively awake. In the warm silence Janet dozed, only to be suddenly awake again. Why, she didn't know. Taos had not even raised his head, but his hair bristled and his eyes searched her face. She reached over and patted his head, thinking she'd be better off alone, he was such an old fuss-budget. The clock ticked. The fire crackled. A log fell apart and rolled out on the hearth. Janet took the tongs and put the log back on the fire. Taos whined to get out and she opened the door for him, leaving it ajar so he could come in again. Five minutes passed. Ten. \"Taos!\" she called sharply. \"Come in!\" \"He no come in. He dead.\" Janet whirled toward the guttural\nTOMORROW'S CUP\nvoice behind her. \"Mike!\" she gasped. \"How did you get in this room? What are you doing here?\" The Indian smiled insolently. \"White squaw very nice,\" he said. \"Me want whiskey! You come store.\" Janet was trying desperately to hide her fear. \"You know there is no whiskey in the store. Paul Morgan knows whiskey is bad medicine. He will whip you if he finds you here.\" \"You come store,\" the Indian said savagely. \"Me no key,\" Janet said. Her first panic was over. She'd show this filthy savage she wasn't afraid of him or his country either. \"You heap key. Me no fool. White squaw get key or me shoot!\" \"You haven't a gun, Mike, or you'd have used it before this. Now get out!\" She whirled to the mantel. \"I have a gun, see?\" Mike backed away from the gun she whipped into his face, but his eyes lost none of their insolent assurance. \"Me knife!\" he said, and drew a long hunting knife from inside his shirt. \"Me kill dog. Me kill you.\" A dozen guns could not have held the terror for Janet of that long sharp knife. \"I'll I'll get the key,\" she gasped. She backed toward the kitchen door, barely managing to keep the pistol leveled at Mike's head. If only she could get through the door and bolt it there might be time for Paul to come. She turned the knob behind her with her free hand and stepped backward through the door. A shrill laugh stopped her and a small, incredibly strong hand twisted the gun from her fingers. Mike's begay shoved her tri-\n405\numphantly aside and took the gun to his father. Janet staggered, threw her desperate weight against the door, bolting it with the strong oak latch. \"Taos! Where are you?\" She shuddered. Taos was dead or he'd be tearing Mike to shreds. She could hear Mike swearing, searching for the store key. She backed along the wall. \"Paul! Oh, please come now, Paul!\" She prayed. \"Father in Heaven, what shall I do?\" Suddenly the answer came. In her backing along the wall she had bumped into the big cupboard that hid the trap door to the Devil's Corridor. She remembered her husband's laughing words as they had climbed up the corridor, that never-to-be-forgotten day, and out onto the mesa: \"If any Indians ever try to get funny with you, Janet, just you remember this crack. You can get to it from the kitchen... Trap door under the big cupboard....\" She dropped to her knees, shoved a stack of magazines aside from the floor of the cupboard, and crawled in, closing the door carefully behind her. To breathe in such a cramped position was nearly impossible. She tugged at the back panel; it slid to one side, revealing a flight of steep steps that led to a small cave at the mouth of the corridor. Once down these steps and into the corridor she'd be safe. Mike would never find her there. She descended the steps and stood listening. A splintering sound over her head told her that the door she had bolted between herself and Mike had given way. Now, he'd know she was gone. There was a puzzled silence. Then: \"Chinde Clish!\" in Mike's surprised\n406\nvoice. \"Chinde Clish!\" his boy repeated, and banged his boots against the cupboard door. Janet's heart stopped. She had not taken time to close the back panel of the cupboard. If the front door came open they would find the corridor. Mike grunted and overturned the table in his disgust. That told Janet she was still safe. She ran along the floor of the rear cave, to where the real corridor began. There the air was better. She'd climb part way up and wait for Paul to come. Sounds from the house grew fainter, going toward the store. A shot echoed along the corridor as if it had been fired into. Shouts from the direction of the store told Janet that Mike was headed that way, that for the time at least, he had forgotten about her. If he hadn't found the store key he would probably shoot out the windows. When he failed to find whiskey, he would set fire to the store and ride sullenly away. He might even set fire to the house. A sob shook her. They couldn't burn her home. Not El Toro! Paul loved El Toro. He must not come home and find it gone. She ran back along the corridor, stumbling blindly, tears drenching her face. Those renegades would find what she could do if they dared touch El Toro! The passage narrowed until she was crouching again, fighting for breath with every step. A sharp pain made her cry out. She had forgotten her condition. The baby was more important than life. She must not go back until Paul came. And she prayed it might be soon. \"That was a labor pain!\" her mind-JULY 1943\nstated, waiting for a second pain as one strains to catch a faint disturbing noise in the night. It came and Janet sat down heavily. \"I'm going to have a baby!\" she said, \"here alone!\" Her words echoed hollowly along the corridor. Restraint snapped. \"That's what's happening to me,\" she cried. \"That's what your country is doing to me, Paul Morgan. And I just sit here babbling like an idiot!\" A longer pain choked her voice. When it was over, she became suddenly calm. She was being utterly foolish; she had to stop this nonsense. It might be hours before her husband came. Squaws often had their babies alone, and and so could she! She found a sand-covered ledge and curled up on it, determined to relax. Mike must be gone for she hadn't heard a sound for ages. And she couldn't smell smoke. Maybe he wouldn't burn El Toro. A drowsy numbness enveloped her. \"It must be sleep,\" she thought. But her relief was short lived. Pains came in quick succession. \"Paul!\" His name brought no answer. If only she could get back to the fire; it was cold and damp in the corridor. Paul would never find her here. She slid from the bank, dragging her feet painfully, walking was so hard. If she sat down just for a minute then she could get to the trap door. It was hot and close in the corridor now. What she needed was air fresh air! \"Paul \" The word died away in the empty distance. Janet sighed and sank quietly in the dark.\n(To be continued)\nNOTES FROM THE FIELD\nVera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer\nRegulations governing the submittal of material for \"Notes from the Field\" appear in the Magazine for June 1942, page 420."

EXCERPTS FROM LETTER OF FIRST PRESIDENCY The following excerpts from a letter written by the First Presidency of the Church, December 29, 1942, in reply to a question regarding some of the headnotes which appear in books in which Bible content is arranged in literary form, are published herewith, as it is believed they will prove helpful to literature class leaders in the presentation of their lessons: \"It may, in the first place, be observed that quite obviously these headnotes are not a part of the Bible itself, and are merely the views of Mr. Moulton, [Mr. Bates] or others, regarding the books of the Bible. These headnotes are not part of the Bible and, of course, our people should understand that such is the fact. \"With reference to the attitude of the Church toward the Bible, we call your attention to the Eighth Article of Faith which reads: We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the: word of God.. The Church itself accepts the Bible, King James version, as the word of God to men, \"as far as it is translated correctly.' In some places it records history and in other cases it records revelations and the teachings of the Lord to men. In some places the history may be told in the form of drama or of a highly artistic story; in other places the revelations of the Lord are given in poetic expressions of the very highest excellence. But the Bible is, as the Prophet declared when he wrote the Articles of Faith, the word of God. \"Perhaps no other book ever written has been subjected to the fierce criticism under which the Bible has been brought. This is quite natural because it stands to the world as the word of God. \"We feel that... Sisters of the Relief Society should not be at all disturbed by these Moulton [or Bates] headnotes which seem to be giving them concern.\" 444 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JUNE-JULY 1943 Lesson | The Bible Story (Tuesday, October 19, 1943) [XN the opening chapter of Genesis will be found the \"Story of Creation.\" Recast slightly from the chapter and verse arrangement in which it commonly appears, part of this rare story reads: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and morning were the second day. And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together in one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. And God called the dry land earth; and the gathering together of the waters he called seas: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding seed which was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. Step by step the \"Story of Creation\" goes forward in natural sequence the placing of lights in the heavens to divide the day from the night, to set the seasons and the years, and \"to give light upon the earth\"  the creating of fish and fowl and animal life; then  God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.... And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them, and on the seventh day God ended the work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had made. And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.... Certain literary qualities which mark this beginning story of the Bible are characteristic of Biblical stories. First, it moves with simple directness, step by step in an upclimb to the conclusion. Setond, it is clear and concrete in language, with vivid words and phrases at times to light the story. Observe, for instance, \"The earth was without form and void\"  \"darkness was upon the face of the deep\" \"'and God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.\" Third, its sentences are musical. Read them aloud thoughtfully; they move with natural cadence. \"Echo lines,\" such as \"And the evening and the morning were the first day,\" help not only to bind the parts of the story together, but add a rhythmic charm. LESSON DEPARTMENT Fourth, spiritual life-lessons are impressed with such stirring, never-tobe-forgotten expressions as: 'God said, Let there be light: and there was light\" \"God created man in his own image, and in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\" Fifth, Bible stories do not yield all their riches with one reading. Like other great classic stories, they must be reread. While they are so simple in language and form that even a little child can gain something from hearing them, still one must grow up with these stories to catch their inner meaning, their full spiritual significance. One caution here: Do not expect every Bible story to bring the glow of interest that may come from the \"Story of Creation,\" or from some other that you have learned to love. Certain of these stories are difficult even for grownups to understand and appreciate. President Joseph F. Smith once voiced the thought that our Gospel unfolds itself to the seeking soul gradually; let us enjoy those things in it we can appreciate, and God will open further truth for us. This fine advice applies helpfully to our study of the stories of the Bible. Now shall we turn to another of these stories, one which has brought | delight to young and old for ages  the \"Story of Joseph and His Brethren?\" Here 'is a classic tale from the Bible that has won the highest of praise from eminent writers. Mark Twain once expressed his appreciation with words that said in effect that the story of Joseph is one of the greatest short stories ever written. By reading carefully this masterpiece in story writing, we shall discover in it other classic qualities. Like 445 the \"Story of Creation,\" it moves forward step by step with rising interest. Observe, for example, how each sentence carries on the story from its beginning (Genesis 37:3)  Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: For, behold, we were binding sheaves in a field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words. Here, with a few swift strokes we have the basis of the plot round which the story is developed. Jealousy and envy, provoked by an old man's devotion to a son sent to cheer his declining years, bring the selling of the boy into slavery, and the deception that follows to explain away the lad's disappearance. Jacob's grief is assuaged somewhat by his devotion to an even younger son, Benjamin all of which later adds to the developing drama of family life in Old Canaan. Note, as you read the story, the local color: shepherds tending their flocks in the hills; the dangers from wild beasts; a wandering band of Ishmaelites following the old trail that still leads through Canaan into Egypt; a coat of many colors, suggestive of the rich clothing of the 446 orient; \"camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh.\" Note, too, as you did in the \"Story of Creation,\" the choice words and other life-giving expressions that add vividness; for example, \"conspired against him\"; \"cast him into this pit\"; \"stript Joesph out of his coat\"; \"And Jacob rent his clothes.\" __ Omitting Chapter 38, which is not part of the story of Joseph, continue with Chapter 39, which portrays his testing experiences in the home of Potipher. Lessons of spiritual import are concretely impressed in the youth's resistance to temptation, his clean and prayerful living. Finally comes his triumphal rise from prison to high office in the kingdom. Here is the beginning of the fulfillment of his boyhood dream. From the story-telling viewpoint, it is one of the \"literary surprises\" that adds interest. Within these recent testing years, many folk have turned instinctively to the story of Joseph for an example of inspired statesmanship in providing for the welfare of a nation. Our own people will find in it something to brace their own faith in our leaders today. To turn again to the story: One further point to remember is the upclimb of interest in the developing tale. This climatic effect is clearly illustrated in the treatment by Joseph of his brethren. They are given the grain for which they came; and strangely, on returning home, they find the money they paid in their sacks. One admonition also is given: They must not return for more unless they bring with them their youngest brother Benjamin. After- -wards, when famine again threatens, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JUNE-JULY 1943 they persuade their father to let Benjamin go with them. Joseph, though deeply affected at the meeting with his own young brother, still withholds revealing himself. And while he entertains his brethren, he commands the steward of his house, saying (Genesis 44:1-13)  Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word Joseph had spoken. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? Ye have done evil in so doing. And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. Following this dramatic incident, related with such simple yet telling LESSON DEPARTMENT effect, comes the revealing of Joseph to his brethren. It is a fulfillment of the dreams God gave him as visions in his boyhood. There are tears of joy and forgiveness at this revelation of God's working in mysterious ways his wonders to perform. Later comes the \"happy ending\" of a great story when the father is reunited with nis long-lost son, and Israel is established in a land of peace and plenty until another crisis arises. Suggestions for Discussion and Activities 1. Give in their order (without referring to your text) the six steps of creation as revealed in the first chapter of Genesis. What is the \"echo line\" that helps to impress these steps and which gives them unity? 2. Read aloud thoughtfully the first chapter and first three verses of the second chapter of Genesis, listening to the smoothly flowing language with which the \"Story of Creation\" is unfolded. What composer caught the spirit of this story and its music, and created a great oratorio based on it? 3. What eminent English poet took from the \"Story of Creation\" in Genesis the theme for one of the greatest of epics? Name the epic. 4. Review briefly the \"Story of Joseph\" from these literary viewpoints: (a) its central plot; (b) outstanding characters; (c) story movement; (d) language vividness; (e) local color (deal 447 here with the people and customs and life activities portrayed). What is one impressive life lesson you find concretely presented in the \"Story of Joseph\"? What eminent author has in recent years paid rare tribute to this Bible story by using rich matetials suggested by it in a novel of challenging interest? 5. What are some of the characteristics of the Bible story? Name two or more, and be prepared to illustrate the characteristics named with references from any one of the tollowing stories, or from some other Bible story which is a favorite with you: \"Story of the Offering of Isaac'' (Genesis 22); \"Story of the Wooing of Rebekah\" (Genesis 24); \"Story of the Birth and Saving of Moses' | E: xodus, Chapters 1 and 2; \"Story of the Spies and Woman of Jericho\" (Joshua 2); \"Story of the Birth of Samuel\" (I Samuel, Chapter 1); \"Story of Solomon and the Two Mothiers\" (I Kings 3:16-28); \"Story of Elijah and the Widow's Son\" (I Kings, Chapter 17); \"Story of Daniel and the King's Meat\" (Daniel, Chapter 1). In reading the Bible, let its stories tell themselves. If you share them with your children or others, through voicing their musical language, do it simply, thoughtfully, without affectation. Let the story and the life lessons sing themselves into your soul. Such reading will bring not mere entertainment, but recreation. Note: \"The Creation\" was considered in Lesson 5 of the 1942-43 literature course, and is considered once more to emphasize its narrative values.\nSocial Science\nWhat \"America\" Means\nPreview of Lessons for 1943-44\nTHE lessons in Social Science for 1943-44, will be a continuation of the subject studied during 1942-43; namely, \"What 'America' Means.\" Seven lessons have been given, and seven more are to follow. With the completion of these lessons, the subject will be brought to a conclusion.\nThere has never been a time in the history of our nation when it was more important to understand America and the development of the American way of life based upon Christian principles, and to recognize our duties and responsibilities as citizens, than it is today. These are the primary purposes of this course.\nDeep religious ideals permeated the people who first settled America. Generally, they were people who had been persecuted in the Old World. When they came together to form this government, they agreed that religious liberty, the right to worship God according to one's own conscience, should be a fundamental right of every citizen. This right was one of the noblest gifts to mankind in history.\nAnother great conception of the founders of our nation was that universal education should be encouraged. Whereas, in old countries, the common people had been kept in a state of subjection, in America all should be free to work and earn and learn. All had a right to take part in government. Freedom of opportunity was for all.\nBut now, in the great war that is sweeping over the earth, all our ideals, our free way of life, and our national existence are at stake. Our task is to fight against and overcome the evil influences which imperil us. Light must dispel darkness.\nNo lesson is scheduled for the month of December as the General Board does not require that a meeting be held on Tuesday, December 28, 1943.\nThe titles of the seven social science lessons for 1943-44, together with objectives and a brief summary of each lesson, follows:\nLessons 8 and 9. American Statesmen\nThe objectives of lessons 8 and 9 are the same; namely, to show the place that statesmen hold in our national life and the part they play in preserving American ideals and advancing civilization in this country.\nLesson 8 deals with the following statesmen: George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton.\nLesson 9 gives a brief account of the activities of John Marshall, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, Abraham Lincoln.\nSummary: America has produced many outstanding and noble statesmen, men who have devoted their lives to the preservation of our government and the principles upon which it is based. These men accepted Christian ideals and tried to put them into practice.\nLesson 10. The Sacredness of American Citizenship\nObjective: To show that the rights we enjoy as American citizens should be regarded as sacred opportunities and as a power, and that right should be the guide to all Americans in the exercise of their citizenship.\nSummary: The rights conferred upon our citizens by the government should be regarded as sacred. We have freedom of worship, freedom of education, and freedom to work. These are all privileges that have been won in the past, and should be preserved.\nLesson 11. Our American Culture\nObjective: To show that although America is a young nation, as compared with the countries of the Old World, she is already one of the leading nations in culture.\nSummary: The forces that have made America a land of culture have been carefully worked out. Culture is a result of a richness of spiritual life, and is shown in the music, sculpture, architecture, and literature, and in the homelife of a people. Like the true spirit of religion, culture is expressed in fine manners and customs, and kindliness toward one's fellow man. It is a reflection of the inner life of man his mind and spirit.\nLesson 12. Standards of Success\nObjective: To show that America is a religious nation, and that in America standards of success are measured by Christian principles.\nSummary: The American people have accomplished great and lasting things for the development and upbuilding of their country. They hold spiritual life above the material, and they are moved by high purposes; man must know his ideal worth and lift himself to it.\nLesson 13. What America Means to Me\nObjective: To show the material and spiritual forces that have made America the great nation that it is today.\nSummary: To survey this country is to come to the conclusion that it is a land \"choice above all other lands.\" It has all the requirements to make human life happy and prosperous.\nLesson 14. The Need of the Hour\nObjective: To show that the need of the hour is to strengthen the spiritual forces in America and to increase faith in God.\nSummary: At the present time all the evil forces in the world seem to be combined to destroy the freedom and opportunity which America has made great. But we should be strong and full of courage; we are fighting for a righteous cause.\nThe textbook recommended by the General Board for the course \"What 'America' Means\" is the American Citizens Handbook, compiled by J. E. Morgan. This book is obtainable at the Deseret Book Company, 44 East South Temple Street, Salt Lake City, Utah.

Every one of the thirteen original colonies had its leaders in political and civic life, and in reading about them one recalls the words of Carlyle that \"history is recorded in the lives of great men.\"\nFrom the advent of the English settlers to the formation of our Government, men of highest integrity and noble motives gave the people fine concepts of democratic government. It was a group of statesmen of the most valorous character who signed the Declaration of Independence. Fifty-five men in all represented the thirteen colonies, most of whom were highly educated and well qualified to perform the work of their day. They were men who foresaw the beginning of a new nation, \"conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\"\nIt has been well said by one of the first historians of the men who drafted the noble document:\nNo nation can dwell with more just satisfaction upon its annals, than the American people. The emigrants who settled this country were illustrious men; distinguished for their piety, wisdom, energy, and fortitude. No less illustrious were their descendants who served as the guides and counselors of the colonies, or who fought their battles during the Revolutionary struggle. No one who admits the intervention of a special providence in the affairs of nations, can hesitate to believe that the statesmen of the Revolution were raised up by the God of Heaven for the important and definite purpose of achieving the independence of America.\nAmong the group who signed the Declaration of Independence were Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams, Robert Morris, Roger Sherman, and Edward Rutledge, all of whom were representative of the rich political thought of their day. They were the product and the highest promise of American life and American opportunity.\nThere is one character whom we wish to consider briefly, who was not of the group of which we have been speaking, but he caught the spirit of the colonial cause. We refer to the venerable William Pitt, Earl of Chatham. From the beginning of the opposition of America, Pitt had sensed the justice of the cause of the Colonists, and on many occasions he voiced his opposition to the laws passed by Parliament to govern the commerce and trade with America; and when troops were sent to America to enforce what the Colonists declared unjust laws, Pitt arose in the House of Parliament and said:\nWhat foundation have we for our claims over America? What is our right to persist in such cruel and vindictive measures against that loyal and respectable people? My lords, deeply impressed with the importance of taking some healing measures at this most alarming, distracted state of our affairs, though bowed down with a cruel disease, I have crawled to this House to give you my best counsel and experience; and my advice is to beseech His Majesty to withdraw his troops from America. It will convince America that you mean to try her cause in the spirit, and by the laws of freedom and free inquiry, and not by codes of blood.\nTo such a policy, the ministry of England was not prepared to listen, but Pitt's plea shows that England was divided in her attitude toward the American Colonists, something that not all Americans know.\nIt was also a most extraordinary body of men that gathered together in 1787 to frame the Constitution of the United States. Never did such a group of powerful and brilliant intellects, men trained by experience, assemble for so great an undertaking as the framing of a constitution for a nation. And the best proof of the success which attended their efforts is to be found in the fact that the constitution which they framed for a nation of three million people has been found now fit for a hundred and fifty millions. Both major parties have vied in their admiration of the Constitution of the United States, for both have insisted that the venerable instrument, if correctly interpreted, supported their own tenets.\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN was one of the committee of five appointed by the Second Continental Congress to draft the Declaration of Independence. His great work was to create in America a feeling of unity. Going to France as a representative of the colonial government, he was instrumental in making a treaty with that country which was favorable to our Government. Although over seventy years of age, he was popular in French society, and his simple ways and quaint manners won for him many friends. Oxford University made him a Doctor of Laws, and he was soon a favorite all over Europe for his learning, statesmanship, discoveries of science, and practical inventions. A member of the Convention which formed the Constitution of the United States, it was Franklin who made the motion that the meetings of the Convention be opened every day with prayer. \"I have lived a long time,\" said he, \"and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men.\" Franklin published one of the first newspapers in America as well as the famous \"Poor Richard's Almanack.\" He founded the American Philosophical Society and the Philadelphia Public Library. His autobiography is one of the most noted classics of American literature.\nGEORGE WASHINGTON was not only a soldier, the greatest of his day, but he was one of the outstanding statesmen of all time. He was in Boston at the head of the colonial army when the Declaration of Independence was drafted. In 1787 the Constitutional Convention met at Philadelphia, and Washington was made chairman of the assembly. With the adoption of the Constitution, he was chosen our first President. His cabinet was made up of the best men of the country, and in all the work of planning and forming the new government, of settling the policies of the Republic both at home and abroad, Washington was always equal to his problems. During his administration, a flood of infidelity swept over the United States. Keenly alive to its dangers, he dwelt in his Farewell Address on the fact that it was on religion and morality that our Government was founded. Whether at home or abroad, he was always careful of his personal appearance, and his manners were gracious and gentle. \"His faith in God was his greatest armour,\" says one historian, \"and this was the salvation of his country.\" Washington's record as one of the greatest military leaders of the world made him \"first in war.\" His unique position as the one man above all others who aided our country to frame and adopt the Constitution, and his great service as the first President of the United States, made him \"first in peace.\" It was his supreme faith in God for he was known as the \"Christian Statesman\" which made him \"first in the hearts of his countrymen.\" John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States wrote in his biography of Washington, these words: \"Without making ostentatious professions of religion, he (Washington) was a sincere believer in the Christian faith and a truly devout man.\" In Washington's First Inaugural Address, he said: \"No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency.\"\nVERY few men have left a deeper impression upon our nation and its government than Thomas Jefferson. One of the foremost men in American politics, he was responsible for writing the Declaration of Independence, and during two terms he was President of the United States. Although he never made a formal speech in his life, Jefferson was ranked as the greatest political leader of his day. A large part of his public work was done with the pen. During the American Revolution, he was busy at the head of civil affairs in his native state, Virginia. He followed Patrick Henry as governor of his state and succeeded Benjamin Franklin as American minister to Paris. During his first administration as President of the United States, he made the famous Louisiana Purchase, which extended the United States from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. Jefferson's political life closed in 1809, and in his quiet home at Monticello, Virginia, he spent his days in establishing the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville. Jefferson was Secretary of State in the cabinet of President Washington, and Alexander Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury. Both of these men held extremely opposite views as to government. Hamilton was a Federalist and held to the idea of a strong central government; while Jefferson was opposed to slavery and was an ardent advocate of State Rights. His party was called the Republican, which afterward became the Democratic Party. He held that the federal power should be limited as much as possible. He placed his confidence in the voice of the people. Monticello, now preserved as a national memorial, was Jefferson's home for over fifty years. Here on a part of his large estate, he built his unusual and fascinating house from his own design. Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, just fifty years after the signing of the Declaration of American Independence. It is interesting to note that at this writing, the beautiful memorial to Jefferson's memory, located on the banks of the Potomac River, has been fittingly dedicated in the city of Washington.\nANOTHER great statesman of the Revolutionary period was Alexander Hamilton, who was Secretary of the Treasury in Washington's cabinet. \"Next to George Washington,\" said Chief Justice Marshall, \"there has been no one to whom our Republic owes more.\" Born in the West Indies, his father was a Scotchman and his mother a beautiful French Huguenot. He came to New York in 1772, which was ever after his home. He was a great reader of Plutarch and Pope and many other great authors. A graduate of King's College, now Columbia University, he fought in the American Revolution, and took part in drafting the Constitution of the United States. His most important work was in the country's finances, and he was instrumental in the establishment of the Bank of the United States. He was the leader of the Federal Party, which stood for a strong central government over and above the states. More than any other statesman, Hamilton's plans for the money matters of the country restored the public credit, and trade and prosperity grew fast. He stood for a high protective tariff and encouraged home manufacture. He withdrew from the service of his country when only thirty years of age, and was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr on July 12, 1804.\nIN thinking of the great men who founded this Republic and gave it the Constitution of the United States, we sense deeply the words of Sir Francis Drake, when he said:\nMen pass away, but people abide. See that ye hold fast the heritage we leave you. Yea and teach your children its value, that never in the coming centuries their hearts may fail them or their hands grow weak. Hitherto, we have been too much afraid. Henceforth, we will fear only God.\nAny one-volume history of the United States will be helpful as a reference.\nQuestions and Study Suggestions\n1. Why did the American colonists go to war with England in 1775?\n2. Who were some of the men who took part in that struggle?\n3. What was the Declaration of Independence? Who were some of the men who took part in drafting it?\n4. Who were some of the great statesmen of that period? By referring to any good American history, prepare something about the lives of: Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin.\n5. Give more extensive study to one character, and enumerate characteristics he possessed which you would desire to emulate.\n\nStories from the Book of Mormon\nFor optional use of Relief Societies in stakes and missions in countries other than the United States, in lieu of social science lessons.\nPreview of Lessons for 1943-44\nTHIS is the first year of a probable two-year course of lessons entitled, \"Stories from the Book of Mormon.\" The objectives of the course are threefold: First, to stimulate interest in the Book of Mormon; Second, to teach the Gospel as taught in the Book of Mormon; Third, to familiarize members with characters and events of the Book of Mormon.\nThere are only seven lessons for this first year of the course as no lesson is prepared for the month of December as the General Board does not require that a meeting be held on Tuesday, December 21, 1943.\nThe lesson titles and objectives are as follows:\nLesson 1 What is the Book of Mormon? Objective: To become acquainted with the historical background of the Book of Mormon.\nLesson 2 Lehi's Travels to the New World Objective: To show that belief in God is best evidenced by a willingness to serve and obey him.\nLesson 3 Nephi, a Leader in the Land of Promise Objective: To show the rewards of righteousness.\nLesson 4 Rebellion of the Lamanites Objective: To show that wrongdoing and disobedience to God's will bring evil results.\nLesson 5 Deliverance of Alma and Amulek from Prison Objective: To show that \"the Lord gives us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance.\"\nLesson 6 Conversion of Lamanites by Ammon and his Brethren Objective: To show that the arm of the Lord is extended to all people who will repent and believe on His name.\nLesson 7 Christ's Visit to the Nephites Objective: To develop an added appreciation for the meaning and purpose of baptism.\nThe references to be used in this course are limited to the four standard works of the Church plus the Articles of Faith by James E. Talmage, inasmuch as these are the only references many foreign-speaking missions have translated into their own languages.\nThe following excerpts from a letter of the author of these lessons indicating the factors that guided him in writing the lessons, will be helpful to the teacher in preparing the lessons for the coming year:\nFirst, I believe that the greatest thing about the Book of Mormon is the Book of Mormon. I have felt at times in the lessons I have seen planned for the study of this book, that too much \"writer\" and not enough \"Book\" is present.\nIt seems to me that the most important thing in planning a lesson for a book is to find ways of letting the author speak. In this case the author is the Lord and for this reason there is a great need to get people to reading His word, both in groups and alone.\nSecond, most of the lessons I see taught in the mission field start from scratch with the lesson outline often the teacher is the only one with a copy of this and a possible volume of the standard works of the Church. I have kept this thought in mind in planning the lessons.\nThird, the questions given are simple. They will get a rather thin discussion I feel, but after a reading of the Book of Mormon text the discussion should pick up. Both the questions and the reading activity provide immediate and simple tasks for the class to do. There ought not to be so many \"dead spots\" following a teacher's request for answers to difficult questions. Get a class into the actual scripture and the desire for discussion grows.\nLesson 1 What Is the Book of Mormon?\n(Tuesday, October 26, 1943)\nNote: For the full effect of the lesson it is imperative that one or more copies of the Book of Mormon be at hand during the class discussion.\nA DIRECT answer to the question, \"What is the Book of Mormon?\" may be found by a careful reading of the pages which precede the actual Book of Mormon itself. These, in the 1920 edition, are bound with the main text. They contain three highly significant statements which demand serious thought:\n1. The title page\nThis comes from the hand of Moroni, the last mortal man to possess the record. He lists there these important facts concerning the book:\nIt is...\nThe record of the people of Nephi, and also the Lamanites Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the House of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile....\nSealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile The interpretation thereof by the gift of God\nTo show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers....\nAnd also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations....\n2. The pages describing the origin\nThe coming forth to earth again of this record was by means of an angelic visitation from no other than the same risen Moroni to Joseph Smith. This stirring account is told in the language of simple truth by Joseph Smith himself.\n3. The page bearing the testimony of witnesses\nThe sober testimony of three witnesses, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, who also saw the angel as he lay before their marveling eyes the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, will be found as the last of these significant statements. As if for good measure the Lord provided eight other witnesses whose testimony is also found on the last page; eight other men who also \"saw,\" and \"handled,\" and \"hefted\" the plates of gold with engravings thereon which Joseph Smith showed them.\nIt is suggested that at this point the teacher or some members of the class read aloud the full account of these pages here briefly described which precede the actual text of the Book of Mormon. No more soul-stirring account of the true meaning and purpose of this wonderful record has ever been written. After reading these things proceed with the lesson which follows.\nTo establish His word in the last days God promised another witness to go hand in hand with the Bible. (Ezekiel 37:15-20) There was to be the Stick of Judah, the Bible, which came by way of the Jews; and the Stick of Joseph, the Book of Mormon, which came by way of another tribe of Israel, that of Joseph.\nThis latter record was to come \"out of the dust,\" which it literally did, having been hid in the Hill Cumorah. (Isaiah 29:4)\nThat God could and would bear witness of His great plan of life to all nations is apparent in all His statements recorded in the Bible. Suffice it to say that those who came to inhabit the Americas did so by His command the first people soon after the confusion of tongues at the Tower of Babel; the second in 600 B. C. fleeing the destruction of Jerusalem. From this latter exodus two great nations of people sprang up, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites.\nThe truth of these facts can and will be established as time goes on. Men may be certain of that. Of greater importance to us who have come to know the power of God's word as recorded in the Book of Mormon is this that much of the Gospel, plain and precious, lost through translations of the Bible is given in the Book of Mormon. Herein lies a most powerful means of reaching the human heart. The word of God clearly understood is quickly embraced by one who would know the truth.\nJoseph Smith's story of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon becomes more convincing once the words of the book itself are read with an open mind. Note the simplicity of this passage which clearly states the need there will be in the latter days for another witness of Christ and His mission:\n\"But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.\" (II Nephi 3: 11)\nThe Bible exists today. Has it brought men to an absolute and unshaken faith in their Redeemer? Would the many, many sects and creeds of religious worship now with us, seemingly based upon the Bible, be an answer to this question? \"Christ, the example,\" they say. \"Christ, the leader,\" they teach. But Christ, the literal Son of God who lived and died for man, and who lives now, resurrected and glorified, to return again what definite answer has the world for these great questions?\nGod knew even His chosen people would need more convincing word in the days when men would heap to themselves teachers who should turn the truth to fables. (II Timothy 4:3-4) And this word, in wisdom, He kept hid up until its power would strike like a two-edged sword.\nIf you have not been touched with the simplicity and power of the Gospel, made plain through the words of the Book of Mormon, seek this experience now. The following reading activities may help you.\nFor example, let us carry through the plan for one such reading exercise. Think first of some phase of the Gospel which may need more explanation for a clearer understanding than is found in the Bible; for example, the closing verse of the sixth chapter of Matthew: \"Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\"\nThis comes as part of the Sermon on the Mount following the suggestion that one forsake the worldly care of providing food and drink and raiment for the body in order to serve God rather than Mammon. But has not God condemned the idler, and him who refuses to work? What kind of a world would this be if all of us took no thought of the morrow? And yet the Lord has given us these words. Have not you with other thinking Christians often wondered at the inconsistency of this verse?\nIf you follow through the complete text of the Sermon on the Mount there is no suggestion as to whether the Lord meant these words for all the multitude, and hence all men, or for His chosen disciples who were to spend their lives in the service of God. Somehow through the many translations of the Bible this fact was omitted.\nWhen Christ appeared to the Nephites upon the American continent, what was recorded of His visit is more completely given. In III Nephi 13:25 we read: \"And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words He looked upon the twelve whom He had chosen, and said unto them: Remember the words which I have spoken. For behold, ye are they whom I have chosen to minister unto this people. Therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.\"\nRead on from this point to the end of the chapter and note how this verse makes plain and logical the meaning of the words of Christ in the New Testament.\nQuestions and Readings for Discussion\nWith the help of other suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the questions; second, read the passages given to discover other plain and precious truths of the Gospel brought to light through the Book of Mormon. If time permits each class member could add one found by himself from the Book of Mormon that has brought new light to a truth of the Gospel.\n1. What evidence is there in the Bible as to the proper mode of baptism? Name the various ways you know of in which this ordinance has been performed. For reading, 3 Nephi 11: 16-28.\n2. Is infant baptism necessary? For reading, Moroni, chapter 8.\nThe following is an additional exercise if needed for the class, but one which could preferably be used for home reading:\n3. How does the true doctrine of repentance and restoration work in the lives of men? For reading, Alma chapters 39-42.\nReferences: James E. Talmage, Articles of Faith, Chapters 14, 15.\n\nRELATIONSHIP OF THE Y. W. M. I. A. TO THE RELIEF SOCIETY\n(Continued from page 376)\nis indeed the work of God. Thousands of the youth owe their interest in the Church and their testimony to the activities of the Mutual Improvement Associations. Thousands, too, of young women have received a training which has prepared them to enter the Relief Society and give intelligent service there.\nThe Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association desires to cooperate fully with the Relief Society. Cooperation has always been the insignia of success in all Church activities. The L. D. S. Ward is like one large family, with all the auxiliaries giving help in rounding out the lives of the individual members. The women's organizations are an integral part of this ward group, each providing for the different ages the programs and activities that help them build into ideal womanhood.\nNever has there been greater need for these organizations, never has there been wider scope for their talents, and never has there been a more urgent call for them to work hand in hand to meet the problems which the girls and women of the Church are facing at the present period.\nOur young people are surrounded by temptations and dangers far beyond those of normal times. The powers of evil, it would seem, are determined to overthrow righteousness and in no way can this be accomplished so surely as by bringing about the downfall of youth. The moral and spiritual welfare of our girls rests heavily upon us as their leaders, but we are cheered and heartened to know that we have the faith and assistance of the mothers in Israel and of all Relief Society workers throughout the Church. Only through our united effort and the blessings of the Lord can we hope to influence and hold our young people.\nIt is an honor to be included in this special woman's number of your Magazine. May this issue prove to be one more shining link in your historic chain of accomplishments.\n\nSPEAKING on Maternity and the Changing Family Scene, Hazel Corbin of the Maternity Center Association, said:\nWe've got to get over this idea that being a housewife and mother is not an important task in life.... These mothers hold up the glorious traditions of America. They are striving against difficult odds to make home an attractive place for their children, to make it a safe place, a place of security and happiness in which their children are growing up and to which they will want to bring their friends.\nToday there is no task more important than that.

Every effort has been made, both by the General Board and the press, to get the Magazine back on schedule. It has now been decided, after careful consideration of all aspects of the problem, that the only sure means of accomplishing this is to combine two issues of the Magazine. For this reason, the June and July numbers have been combined in one larger issue which is only slightly smaller than the two separate issues would have been. We are sure our subscribers will feel that the advantages of receiving the Magazine near the first of the month for which it is issued will more than offset the loss of the few pages occasioned by the combination of the June and July numbers. Unless new complications arise, subscribers may be assured of receiving all future numbers of the Magazine near the beginning of the month for which it is dated.\nThe Cover\nSEA GULLS ATOP THE SEA GULL MONUMENT\nTHE cover on the June-July Magazine is used to honor the Mormon pioneers, the first company of whom, under the leadership of President Brigham Young, entered Salt Lake Valley, July 24, 1847. The cover is a reproduction of the ball and two sea gulls atop the Sea Gull Monument by Mahonri Young, which stands on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. This monument was erected in 1913 and \"stands as a reminder and lesson to all of the children of the State of the preservation at God's hand of the grain which was to insure food for the pioneers of 1847.\" The ball on the monument is made of granite and the sea gulls are of bronze covered with gold leaf. It is interesting to note the part which sea gulls have played during recent months in providing food for members of our armed forces adrift at sea, notably in the Rickenbacker incident. Photo by H.

            "content": "The Latter-day Saint Family\nIts Ideals and Responsibilities\nElder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union\nTHE perpetuation of the race is a major social purpose of the family. This is universally recognized by thinking people everywhere. The Latter-day Saints accept this but in a much more impressive and far-reaching way than do any other people; this because of their belief in the eternity of the family relationship and the eternal progress of man.\nSexual purity, while long and widely recognized as an ideal, and even among some primitive tribes enforced by severe penalties for its violation, receives a new and much more sacred sanction in the teachings of the Latter-day Saints. Parents are, of course, strictly bound, themselves, to practice chastity in the proper meaning of that term. With this as a foundation, they are religiously obligated to develop in their children the highest ideals of family life and sex relations. This calls for understanding not only of the nature of children and youths in general, but also for careful study of the nature of each child for whose moral and religious education the parents are primarily responsible. This responsibility cannot be shifted to any other agency. The Church and the school should, of course, supplement the educational efforts of the family, and the civic community should do its best to build favorable and eliminate unfavorable influences for the proper moral development of children and youths. It is a great mistake, however, to assume that they, individually or collectively, can relieve the family of its responsibility. One of the tragedies of the war situation is that some mothers, either for what they conceive to be patriotic reasons or for The CoverLake McDonald, Glacier National Park. Photo by Hileman. Page 461 462 financial gain, will leave their children without proper guardianship while they are employed outside the home. A mother's duty to her children is her first duty also to her country. One of the greatest dangers to our country, viewed through the generations, is the character demoralization of her future citizens. Without strength, purity, and integrity of character on the part of citizens generally, there can be no national security or achievement worth saving. ' 'In the training of children, emphasis should always be on the positive side. Wholesome pleasures and stimulation of ambition for service and high achievement may be supplemented at opportune times and circumstances by warnings against temptations to take a downward course, but even this may be done with youth in such a way as to lead them to picture in imagination the dire consequence of evil practices. When a youth pictures vividly to himself the consequence of indulging his appetites or passions contrary to the teachings of the Church, it will have far more weight with him than will mere dogmatic teaching or parental commands, although under some circumstances this method may be necessary, especially with children. Even they, however, are generally more able to think and to understand more than most adults give them credit for. 'They should be given a chance to think and to make some decisions for themselves. Parents should, of course, see that the children are led to revise wrong decisions and never to act upon judgments that may be morally or religiously detrimental either to themselves or to others. Arbitrary commands on the part of parents sometimes have the reverse effect of that anticipated. This may be true of attendance at religious gatherings. Sometimes, attempts to force youth in these matters may lead to deception or rebellion and sometimes to hatred of the obligations that parents attempt to force upon them. Even when, out of respect for parents, they yield to the parental admonition, they sometimes cease the activity as soon as parental authority is outgrown. A teacher in Ancient Greece is credited with saying that it was his business to teach boys to love the right. 'That is a primary obligation of parents toward their children. Until they acquire a love of the right and the habit of acting upon that love as a motive, their characters will be imperfectly formed. SINCERITY Alice Morrey Bailey Never sing to me, I beg, the songs I want to hear Lest they, unwilling, forced, may come discordant to my ear. I'd rather have you, trusting that their joyous truthful ring May touch in me an echo, singthe songs you like to sing. President Rudger Clawson Elder George Albert Smith President of the Council of the Twelve HE following quotation is taken from Some Impressions of My Father by Samuel G. Clawson, son of President Rudger Clawson: \"Life left no residue of bitterness in him; impression and memories left no scar. He never indulged in selfpity; never tolerated self-esteem. There was no elation when he won. He either won and turned victory into wisdom for the next encounter, else he endured and waited. He never lost because he saw time as part of endless eternity.\" Brother Clawson, who passed away Monday, June 21, 1943, presided over the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for eighteen years and has been a member of the Council for forty-five years. I have been privileged to be intimately associated with him for forty years. To know him was to love him. His kindly, gentle ways have endeared him to all who knew him. His quiet, thoughtful mien gave his co-workers confidence in him, his judgment, and purposes. He was a friend to everyone. His kindliness made him the confidant of the heartbroken and weary. He visited and cheered the sick, inspired and gave hope to the discouraged. Undeviating loyalty to the Presidency of the Church was an outstanding characteristic of the life of President Rudger Clawson. He was a consistent and industrious, hard-working executive. He presided with dignity over the Council of the Twelve Apostles making the stake and mission visiting appointmnts both for this. Quorum, the PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON First Council of Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. He was careful and considerate in his budgeting of assignments, endeavoring to divide the burdens equally. He took his full share of the work and utilized every ounce of his energy to take care of the responsibilities placed upon him as long as his strength permitted. All his public utterances were marked with toleration. His discourses were full of substance and deserving of careful study. A proverbial patience, a flawless faith, a fidelity to the truth coupled with a devotion to the Church and all that it stands for, have made achievements possible which will remain eternally to the credit of Rudger Clawson. Page 463 A Pioneer Homemaker Julia A. Caine A NEW world was opened in 1803 to the expanding Americans who were pushing beyond the western hills. All life seemed to revolve around new ideas and dreams of homes to the west of the broad Mississippi. Word of the great purchase was carried into the isolated hamlets of New Hampshire by postrider, and here men gathered on street corners and talked of moving to the new country, Louisiana, the land beyond the Mississippi. While excitement was at its height in the town of Hillsborough, New Hampshire, a baby girl was born who was to traverse that great territory far into the west and was to establish the first home in the Great Basin. The tiny baby, Harriet Page Wheeler, cared little for her father's talk of the great Napoleon, Indians, and Lewis and Clarke, but these ideas were everyday conversation in the little home, and the West held a promise of adventure as she grew up in New England. Her own home was the typical frontier house of the small settlements where the family was taught to do all things needed for its comfort. She learned to weave her own clothes, trim her own hats, and cook for the family. At the age of sixteen, she was ready for a real adventure in the fabulous West. School teachers were scarce in those days, and a seventeen-year-old gitl who could teach reading, writing, and arithmetic might easily get a position in the familiar little schoolhouse. Harriet packed her Page 464 Caine trunk and set forth for western New York where friends had secured her the job of schoolmarm at Phelps. The young teacher had a school attended by children of all ages. She was very dignified as she listened to the primer class sing their alphabet and as she helped the older students with their fractions. Indian stories in the old readers were her special delight and she must have dreamed often of a land even farther west then frontier New York. The schoolmarm boarded around in the village, went sleigh riding, and made friends with everyone. One of the town's young men soon became her constant companion and eventually, upon becoming the wife of Isaac Decker, Phelps became her home. But America was moving west, and any move to a new frontier held out golden promise. The Deckers joined this moving throng, and finally came to settle in the Ohio country where land was cheap. At New Portage, their home was the typical frontier dwelling. Each morning the family was up at 5 o'clock and breakfast was eaten by lamp light. The boys aided their father in the barnyard, the girls helped with the household tasks, and soon learned to weave, bake bread, and sew. The browneyed Harriet was building her frontier home as her people before her had builded in New England. \"TRAVELERS were few in this land of little hamlets, and the family welcomed a preacher who A PIONEER HOMEMAKER talked of wonderful things that had happened in New York State. How the tired housewife must have enjoyed hearing 'of rivers and hills so near to her old home in Phelps. The wandering preacher was asked to return and the family began to read the books he discussed. They had attended many revival meetings in the past, but this man talked of a new religion that followed the old teaching of the Biblea religion of joy and promise. Here happiness was the keynote. He spoke of a gathering of his people to the West. Soon the Decker family gathered their belongings, joined the Latterday Saint Church, and moved west to Franklin, Ohio, near Kirtland, the home of many Latter-day Saint people. They joined wholeheartedly with their new companions, and, when the Church was in need of funds, the father of this little family gave his entire savings to help his people. Like all Latter-day Saint families, this family was looked upon with distrust by non-Mormon neighbors, who soon began to avoid them. What courage it must have taken to join with other Latter-day Saints and leave for the far Missouri! The turbulent Westerners in Missouri hated the quiet industry of this people who built towns so quickly on the best river lands. Many of the early settlers had come to the frontier either to procure large slave holdings or because they did not fit into the orderly society of the East. Mormon homes grew too rapidly into settlements. Frontier Missouri finally succeeded in driving the Mormons out. So back across Missouri moved the 465 tired little band, and in 1841 they settled on land at a bend of the Mississippi River, later to be known as Nauvoo the Beautiful. Here the well-built houses and shaded streets brought memories of New England. The Decker family now hoped that they had found a permanent home. Yet, even now, the little dwelling was not secure. Isaac Decker had tired of the continual moving and no longer felt enthusiastic for the society that shut him apart from other companions, and so he and his wife, whose whole soul was dominated by religious fervor, parted. Later, she married Lorenzo D. Young and made a pleasant home on the bank of the Mississippi. When the terrible months of persecution came and the Prophet-leader was killed, mobs threatened the beautiful Nauvoo, and Harriet was one of the first to make preparations to move to the West. HE broad Mississippi was frozen as the wagons waited in front of the little home on that cold February day in 1846. The children climbed inside; Lorenzo Young helped his wife into the wagon, and they turned toward the river. Across the ice and on to the Missouri moved the people, trusting in their leaders, who were men of God, to lead them to a new home. When the early spring of 1847 came, Winter Quarters, the temporary resting place of the Saints, was a bustle of activity. Songs of the West rang out and there was talk of California. There was. Also talk of missions to the Indians and how even now the elders of the Church were preaching to the Lamanites. 466 Definite plans were made for a small company to go farther west and to find a home for the people. Harriet's husband was chosen a member of this party. Harriet, suffering from maleria, begged to be taken with them. Brigham Young yielded to Lorenzo and Harriet's desire and agreed to let her go. Two other women also went with this band of scouts over the mountains to find a refuge and a home. 'They were Clara Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young and daughter of Harriet, and Ellen S. Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball. Two children accompanied Harriet. On April 7, the heavily loaded wagons started the long trek west. Seeds, plows, chickens, pigs, and cows made the caravan a picturesque sight. Each night the wagons formed a circle with interlocking wheels into which the cattle were driven. Each evening the women cooked over the campfire. Songs were sung around the fires which awakened echoes on the Platte River that had previously known only the whoop of Indian braves or the more riotous songs of the fortune seeker. Each morning this band of pioneers was up at five o'clock and by seven the train was moving on toward the Rockies. Rafts were built to ford the streams as the band pushed west. In late July the pioneers crossed the South Pass where eleven years earlier Narcissa Whitman had kneeled in thanksgiving for the right to carry the white man's Book to the Indians; but the path of these pioneers lay to the south. The Oregon had become the destination for too many traders and homeseekers. Soon the wagons crossed the rug ged Uintahs and wound down nartow Echo Canyon, where boulders and brush made it hard going for the wagons. The men had to cut a trail; rocks had to be moved. When the turn was made into East Canyon, the way seemed almost impassable. 'The canyon itself was steep; wolves lurked in the underbrush, and rattlesnakes lay in wait for the unwary. The crooked stream was willow-fringed, and rocks made the frequent crossings very slow and precarious. Everywhere huge peaks towered, and the July sun beat upon the toiling men as they tried to clear a way. At last Big Mountain was reached, and from its summit they glimpsed a broad valley which lay over yet another mountain. This must be the place Bridger had told of! This was the valley Goodyear had described. They hoped it was better than the traders had pictured. Now the little band rallied its strength, and by midday, Brigham Young and his brother Lorenzo and their wives were on the benchland east of the Great Salt Lake Valley. The broad stretches of treeless country shimmered in the heat. The women looked over their new home; a lizard ran across the foot of Harriet. She was tired. No house, grass or trees rested her weary eyes. She heard Brigham Young say, \"This is the place,\" and she burst into tears. THE journey had been hard and now this! The sage brush, the sunflowers, nothing looked like home to her as she cried, \"Lorenzo, we have traveled fifteen hundred miles over prairies, deserts, and mountains, but feeble as I am, I would rather journey A PIONEER HOMEMAKER a thousand miles farther than stay in this desolate place.\" But this was to be home. Lorenzo immediately plowed a small tract of land, onto which the water from City Creek was diverted, and he planted the first potatoes in the valley. The day following the entrance into the valley, a strange little assembly gathered, and a little band of worshippers thanked God for their new home. 'They were advised to make a fort for protection, and the next day the work of planting and home building began. At first Harriet's house was in the log and adobe fort, but this was so different from her usual home that she was very unhappy. Her new baby, who had been born in September, fretted in the mud-roofed cabin, and all the houses were so close together that Harriet lacked the privacy she craved. She was a home builder, and stockade life was disagreeable to her. In December, therefore, Lorenzo completed a log cabin of his own outside the fort some distance away. The other members protested at this move because of the danger of Indians, but Harriet thought only of homemaking. Even after an unfriendly Indian did invade her cabin 467 one day, she still refused to leave. It was in January, as she rocked her baby, that the rude savage invaded the little house and demanded \"biscuit.\" Through a ruse, she loosed her watchdog, a powerful mastiff tied in the next room, and took the bow and arrows away from the Indian who had been wounded by the dog. Then, binding up the shoulder of the sullen native, she sent him on his way, and continued her life outside the fort. Spring had hardly arrived before the beauty-loving Harriet was hard at work making her house a home. She had brought the first children into the little settlement. Her son was the first white boy to be born in the Valley. Now she began to plan her home. Lorenzo brought a small locust tree from the mountains, and Harriet planted it in the front of her house. This was the first tree planted in the Valley. Her yard was the present yard of the Bee Hive House. This intrepid woman had dreamed of the great West, but always as a place of homes. She realized that dream as she planted trees and gardens. Men may plan cities, but women build homes. Salt Lake City is a city of homes and trees, and Harriet Wheeler Young was its original homemaker. MY WANTS. Roberta Bates I only want a little house, A lilac tree beside the door. A house with windows clean and bright, And sunlight dancing on the floor To the lilting music of childish laughter; A hearth whereon a kettle sings; Some birds to nest in the lilac tree, And a patch of sky to try their wings. Food Preservation Edna K. Ward HERE are several methods 'of \"preserving\" the home food supply of fresh fruits and vegetables during the summer growing season. 'To know that no fruits nor vegetables have been wasted, and to have an adequate winter supply of these important foods will be a great satisfaction to all homemakers. Latter-day Saint housewives have always been interested in preserving the summer supply of fruits and vegetables for winter use, and have practiced the adage of \"waste not, want not.\" Vegetables and fruits may be preserved by canning, drying, freezing, and storing. It is the purpose of the following discussion to explain briefly the last three methods. DRYING Drying or dehydration of fruits and vegetables means that enough water is removed to stop the growth of molds and other organisms. If done properly, it will also preserve much of the flavor, color, and food value. Dried products occupy less space for storing. Drying Vegetables 1. Select vegetables that have reached the table-use stage. 2. Clean thoroughly, remove all blemishes. 3. Precook or steam. This prevents excessive loss of food value, sets the color, and hastens drying. Steaming is preferable to boiling in water. Any large kettle in which a rack arrangement can be placed to keep the vegetable up out of the water niay be used Page 468 for steaming, provided the kettle has a tightly-fitting lid. Snap Beans Cut in one inch lengths Steam 15 to 20 minutes Dry 4 to 7 hours Peas Steam 10 minutes Dry 3 to 5 hours Corn Split each row of kernels lengthwise before cutting and scrape cob with a knife to get all the milk from the cob. To 4 quarts of corn add: 1 cup cream or rich milk  cup sugar 2 tablespoons salt Mix and boil for 20 minutes stirring constantly to prevent scorching. Spread in shallow pans and dry in the oven or dryer, stirring often. Dry until the kernels will break with clean glass-like fracture. Spinach Leaves or Other Greens Strip out heavy midribs from chard or other large leaves. Steam 1 to 3 minutes Spread on trays covered with cheesecloth, dry 2 to 4 hours in the oven. Oven Drying For most families the oven is large enough to dry all necessary foods. It is convenient and inexpensive. Cover the racks with cheesecloth or other thin material. Set the temperature control at 150. Open the oven door about every hour and change the position of the trays to give uniform drying. The temperature may be increased to 250 and FOOD PRESERVATION the oven door left slightly open all the time if desired. Drying Fruit Practically all commercially dried fruit is treated with sulphur. This is to improve the appearance, keeping qualities, and food values. After sulphuring, the fruits are sun-dried. They should be covered with cheesecloth or screens to prevent flies or insects from contaminating them. Apples Apples are the most commonly dried fruit. 'They are sliced in quarter-inch slices and may or may not be sulphur treated and dried in full sun. Fruit that is sufficiently dried has an elastic springy feel. Most fruits such as cherries, peaches, apricots, and pears are canned for home use. These fruits may also be dried, however. The Utah State Agricultural College Extension Service in Logan will supply detailed methods of sulphur treatment and drying these fruits. Drying Herbs Parsley, mint or sage may be easily dried for winter use. Hang them inside with the leaves down, and when dry, remove the leaves and store them in glass jars. 4 Storing Dried Products Be sure that foods are thoroughly dry. Sun-dried fruits should be heated in the oven at 200 before storing. Store in paper bags, covered jars, or airtight tins. Preparation for the Table Soak overnight or for several hours (about one pound of vegetables per pound of water). Drain the water into a kettle, bring it to a 469 boil, add the dried product and cook until tender. Do not overcook. FREEZING This method of food preservation is comparatively new, and is becoming increasingly popular. The natural fresh flavor, appearance, and food values are satisfactorily maintained. Present research indicates that quick freezing does not destroy vitamins A, thiamin (B:), riboflavin (Bs), or ascorbic acid (C). Vitamin losses increase if the preparation for freezing is delayed. Following are some rules to insure high-quality frozen products: 1. Select high-quality fresh products ready for immediate use. 2. Clean and prepare to preserve natural color, flavor, and food values. 3. Pack or wrap in reasonably airtight containers. 4. Freeze in quick freeze room where temperature is 10 or 15 degrees below zero. 5. Store in lockers where temperature is kept at zero. 6. Keep products frozen until ready for use. 7. Cook products requiring cooking in such a way as to retain the most food values. Freezing Fruits Fruits that freeze satisfactorily include all kinds of berries, cherries, apricots, peaches, figs, plums, and prunes. 1. Select fruits ready for table use. 2. Wash carefully, discard underripe, overripe, or bruised sections. 3. Cut large fruit (apricots, peaches, prunes) in halves or slices. 4. Pack in waxed containers, fruit jars or enameled tins. (Do not use rub- ' ber rings on fruit jars.) 470 5. Use sugar, (1/2 cup to 1 quart of fruit) ot cold syrup (342 cups sugar to 1 quart water).; 6. Keep fruit as cool as possible and get to the locker at once. 7. Freeze at 10 to 15 degrees below zero. 8. Store where temperature is kept at zero with no more than 5 degrees variation. Freezing Vegetables Vegetables that freeze satisfactorily include asparagus, green beans, lima beans, broccoli, chard, corn, peas, spinach, and cauliflower. To Prepare Vegetables for Freezing 1. Select as for table use (get products to locker as quickly as possible; no more than two hours should elapse between time of harvesting and freezing). Z. Clean and wash thoroughly. Cut, shell or slice according to type of vegetable. 3. Scald vegetables in boiling water. Use a wire basket or mosquito netting bag. Be sure water is boiling. Scald small amounts, 5 to 6 pounds. Do not over-scald. Time: Asparagus2-3 minutes Beans (Lima)2-3 minutes Beans (Snap)2-3 minutes Broccoli3-5 minutes Cauliflower2-3 minutes Corn (cut)z2-5 minutes Peas1-1/2 minutes 4. After scalding, place at once under cold running water and leave until the vegetable is as cold as the water. Remove from water as soon as the vegetables are cooled. 5. Place products in waxed containers, fruit jars with rubber-rings or all sealing lids, or enameled cans that are airtight. 6. Pack vegetables dry or in a 2% brine solution. In the brine pack method, vegetables are packed dry in containers, and then 1/ cup of brine is poured over each pint, leaving 2 inch head space in pint containers, and 4 inch in quart containers. Brine Solution 4 teaspoons table-salt dissolved in 1 quart warm water 5 1/3 tablespoons table-salt dissolved in 1 gallon warm water Chill brine before pouring over. Vegetables. (The brine solution should be used as the cooking water when vegetables are used. ) 7. Keep the vegetables as cold as possible until they reach the locker. 8. Quick freeze and store in locker. HOME STORAGE Several vegetables lend themselves to storage better than to any other method of preservation. Carrots, beets, celery, onions, late cabbage, parsnips, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and turnips may be stored as they come from the garden. Cabbage Vitamin C is one of the important food nutrients in cabbage. Raw cabbage is one of the cheapest year-round vitamin C foods. It also contributes calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Cabbage may be stored and used fresh. It may also be made into sauerkraut and packed in jars. Sauerkraut Use fully matured heads. Shred and place in stone jars. Use alternate layers of cabbage and salt in proportion of one pound of salt to forty pounds of cabbage. Pack firmly in stone jar, cover with a clean cloth and a board or plate on which is placed a weight heavy enough to cause the brine to come up to the cover. Keep at about 86 F. For about 10 days to allow it to ferment. Remove skum as it forms. Pack in glass jars and add enough brine to fill jar. (Continued on page 478) Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon ERNARD SHAW has stated that woman's emancipation, with the growth of feminism, has not tended to discourage masculinity in men, but has tended to discourage boorishness, a trait of the weak who are trying to conceal their weakness. \"THERE have always been men who believe that women like to be dominated by the \"stronger sex.\" Ralph A. Habas, in the April issue of Facts, discusses this question thoughtfully in an article, \"Do Women Want Domination?\". He takes the negative viewpoint, and says that an attitude of voluntary cooperation should be the keynote of a happy marriage; neither dominance nor submissiveness, but a deep-seated regard for each other's personality. \"THE magnitude of America's Red Cross movement may be gauged by activities in its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters, reported by Louis Markey in \"Twenty-four Hours a Day,\" (Red Book, April 1943.) Most of the 43,000 workers are women, generally unpaid volunteers. In the Home Service Division, contacts are established, when necessary, between American families and their sons overseas (about 8,000 cases monthly). In the Blood Donors' Division, twenty cots are occupied nearly all the time. Stationary canteens are operated by 2,000 women. 'There are 1,000 nurses' aids, 200 Gray Ladies, 300 staff assistants, 500 stenographers and clerks, and 100 F. B. I. Assistants. In the Public Education Division, 250,000 women have taken courses in first aid, home nursing, nutrition, and diet. The workers deliver 5,500,000 surgical dressings monthly.

Mrs. Jensen has been active for many years in Relief Society work, and her husband was a ward bishop for seven years, Page 478  EDITORIAL 9 VOL. 30 AUGUST 1943 President Rudger Clawson TRUE and trusted friend of the General Board of the Relief Society was the late President Rudger Clawson. He was appointed by the First Presidency of the Church, in September 1919, \"to audit the books of the General Board, examine the methods of accounting employed and to make recommendations regarding the bookkeeping and accounting as conditions might require.\" He thus became special advisor and supervisor of the business and financial affairs of the Board, which duty he faithfully and efficiently performed. This able and experienced accountant consolidated the accounts of the Board; set up a modern system of bookkeeping, and then for years supervised the operation of that system; with painstaking care he reviewed the accounts and regularly examined the receipts and disbursements; guarded the expenditures; and annually audited the books and at all times gave sound financial advice. He thus set up for Relief Society a safe and wise pattern of procedure which has been easy to follow. As a professional bookkeeper and auditor of long experience, President Clawson's contribution to the General Board has a value so great that it can hardly be measured. With painstaking care President Clawson also examined and became familiar with the Relief Society stake and ward record books, and with the Page 472 annual financial, statistical, and narrative reports sent in annually by these organizations to be audited and compiled by the General Secretary for presentation to the General Board and to the women of the whole organization. Few Relief Society women were more familiar with the inner workings of the organization, and no one was more proud of the systematic and painstaking efforts and accomplishments of stake and ward officers and workers in carrying on these practical affairs of the organization than was President Rug Clawson. Hardly a week in the year passed without a visit to Relief Society headquarters by this good and faithful man. Keenly did he sense his responsibility, and greatly interested was he in the affairs of the organization. 'This close association over a period of more than twenty years, together with his kindness, friendliness, courtesy, and good humor endeared him not only to the executive officers, but to every member of the staff. President Clawson was consulted regarding many of the varied problems of the Society as a whole, and his wise and fatherly counsel and advice were always very helpful. President Clawson was a living example of loyalty and devotion to the Church. No sacrifice was too great for him to make for the Gospel of the Master. He was a great defender of the faith. While he had EDITORIAL always a mild-appearing manner, yet for the right he was always aggressive. He always manifested that same courage which he exhibited when, as a young missionary in Georgia, he bravely faced the firing squad of that threatening and infuriated mob which had brutally taken the life of his missionary companion; and as he stood beside the dead 473 body of his associate and listened to the continued threats of the mob, he even bared his breast and told them to shoot. This surprising attitude on his part so startled the mob that they turned away, leaving him alone with the body of his friend and companion in the dense woods of GeorgiaAmy Brown Lyman. Train Up a Child In the Way He Should Go  the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.\" Thus did the Lord speak to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829. In view of this general declaration, how great a responsibility rests upon parents who take upon themselves the sacred obligation of bringing certain spirits into this world through their lineage, clothing them with temporal bodies, and passing on to those spirits much of their physical and mental characteristics. What a strict accounting will be required of parents as to the manner in which they guarded and protected, trained up and set in the path of righteousness those immortal souls specifically entrusted to their care! There is no duty more obligatory upon this earth than the duty resting upon parents to rear their children properly. When parents are called upon to account for the manner in which they have trained their children, what excuse will be accepted for laxness or neglect in the training? Will any mother be able to point to any other service she may have performed as being more vital and important than the proper rearing of her children? In accepting any type of employment, the prime concern of a mother should be the question as to whether or not her children will be properly and adequately cared for during her absence. ) What are some of the activities of a Latter-day Saint family which serve as loops of steel to bind the family together and strengthen it to live, as a unit, a righteous life? One of the strongest bonds. Certainly, is family prayer, the uniting of a family. In a spiritual oneness. Seldom is a family drawn more closely together than at such times. Any righteous activity or observance of a law of the Lord entered into by an entire family will guide that family along the straight path. Among such activities may be mentioned the proper observance of the Sabbath, the keeping of the Word of Wisdom, refraining from any criticism of Church au- (Continued on page 522) Tomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd CHAPTER V Synopsis: Janet, projectingly reared in Washington, D. C., lives in constant dread of the San Juan country of Utah where her husband, Paul Morgan, has an Indian trading post on the mesa. She plans on their moving to Washington before the birth of her baby, but does not disclose this intention to her husband. Upon returning home with Paul after a happy week spent on the mesa, they find that Janet's sister, Rhae, and her husband, Warren Newsbaum, have arrived for a short visit with the announced intention of taking Janet back to Washington with them. The next morning Paul is hurt when he saves Warren from being dragged by a broncho. A few months later, while Paul, restored to health, is absent on a roundup, an Indian, Mike, threatens to kill Janet. She seeks refuge in the Devil's Corridor where she becomes unconscious. HE minute Dr. Potsworth's old Ford rattled into the yard at El Toro he was out of it, his short legs pushing through the sand and up the flagstone path to the house. He panted to a stop as Paul threw open the door, flung his hat aside and grumbled nervously: \"Can't a respectable doctor turn his back on a patient but there's mischief to pay? Janet was laughing and well only a few hours ago!\" \"You saw her? You were here?\" \"Of course. I come as often as the weather and roads will let me. Why, the place looks like the leavings of a tornado! What's been going on here?\" \"IT wish I knew,\" Paul gritted. \"Hurry, doctor, please!\" \"What a mess.\" Dr. Potsworth examined the room professionally. Page 474 \"Quite an operation. An amputation or two; a few broken joints\" \"Never mind the room,\" Paul begged. \"Janet's in here, Doc. Hurty!\" He threw open the bedroom door. \"I found her unconscious in the Devil's Corridor.\" \"Hurt?\" \"T can't tell. Something pretty bad must have happened. I came home to find Taos knifed in the throat, Juanee gone, and the place smashed to bits.\" One look at Janet, lying inert, beads of perspiration along her hairline, and Dr. Potsworth became absorbed. At the sound of their voices, Janet stirred restlessly. Paul took her hand and began to chafe her fingers gently. \"Will you be able to handle this, Doc? You'll know a specialistIt was all my fault. I\" \"Take it easy, Paul. Of course I can handle it. We'll get help when we need it.\" \"Then do something. Don't just stand there looking at -her!\"' \"There isn't anything to do. Not now. 'Tomorrow, maybe.\" \"I can't stand it till tomorrow. It's all my fault, I tell you; I left her alone. I don't even know what happened!\" - \"Whatever is was, it happened after I left here. Evidently it had something to do with Janet's collapse. But I'm inclined to think this might have happened anyway. Janet's lived with fear too long.\" TOMORROW'S CUP \"Fear. Janet afraid? Doc, you're all wrong. Janet isn't afraid of anything! Why, she stands up to this country like a veteran! 'This was no ordinary fear.\" \"No. It's evident that Janet had cause to hide in the Corridor. But that's not what I mean. You've sold yourself on the idea that this country belonged to the gods before they turned it over to you. Well,, it didn't. It's cold and hard and exacting; only you're too absorbed to see it. Janet's been afraid since the day she came to El Toro to live!\" Paul groaned. '\"\"Then let's get her out of here!\" \"Her only chance lies in rest and quiet. She must not be moved.\" \"But what is it? What causes such things? If it wasn't fear, then what was it?\" | \"We don't know. Such cases are not uncommon, however.\" Dr. Potsworth turned from his long contemplation of Janet and went to the window. \"Why don't you do something?\" Paul implored. \"Take her pulse; do anything except just stand there!\" \"Her pulse is all right. I counted the one in her throat. She's tired; she wants to rest.\" \"And I thought mustangs couldn't break her spirit.\" \"She may sleep this off.\" \"But Janet isn't asleep. Even I can tell that!\" \"No. She isn't asleep, now, but she soon will be. She may sleep for days.\" Potsworth turned from the window. \"Don't worry too much, Paul. I have the feeling that What might happen in this case, won't happen. I'll send for Mark Groneman if it'll make you feel bet- 475 ter. He's the latest authority on this sort of thing.\" Paul noted the break in Potsworth's sentence, and his heart sank. He wanted to ask, \"Authority on what?\" but shrank from the clarity of professional terms. If he could believe that Janet was all right, that she was going to be all right, then he could keep sane, and wait. But did Potsworth know? After all, he was getting on in years \"T'll send the telegram to Groneman,\" Paul said. \"There's no one else to go, and the phone is wrecked.\" Potsworth scribbled the message. Paul looked long at Janet,. Then he turned and went hurriedly out. ~ FE, was back before Potsworth expected him, even in his state of mind. \"Possibly a dead horse on the ranch tonight, as well as a dead dog,\" he reproved. \"'There's no use going off the deep end, Paul. I've told you that, for the present at least, Janet is all right.\" Paul nodded miserably. \"'I'd like a clueThere's something unhealthy in store for someone. I wish Joe would come. And what do you suppose happened to that measly squaw?\"' \"Juanee is probably on her way here now. I fancy her leaving, and the fracas here, originated from the same source. Juanee's faithful as only a squaw can be. I'll warrant she's in trouble, too.\" Janet sighed deeply, but not a muscle of her body moved. \"We're talking too much. Suppose you go out and straighten up a bit; pick up the pieces. I'll hold clinic in here.\" 476 \"You'll stay all night?\" \"Yes. But don't you go stirring up trouble. Janet needs you here.\" Potsworth followed Paul out. \"T'll be here, Doc, but that's no insurance for the Indian that started this.\" Potsworth looked at him shrewdly. \"You've got a posse out?\" \"Within an hour every man in Grayson will be out after the Indians.\" | \"Tt's an Indian, all right. Mike. And possibly that brat of his.\" \"Mike! How do you know?\" \"Mike's blind in one eye, and can't shoot straight. See that bullet hole above your head?\" Paul glanced at the casing of the door against which he leaned. Potsworth indicated a gouge in the wood. \"Tt glanced off. I'll bet every bullet that was fired took the same angle.\" Paul picked up the empty shell. \"That came out of my own gun!\" \"There'll be a straight bullet for Mike, and it won't glance off!\" \"Now, look here, Paul. 'The whole Indian nation isn't responsible for this. I'll hold you accountable if there's a feud stirred up. Those hotheads will grab the first Indian they meet. You've got to stop them. Now get out and fix that telephone wire so we can call off the dogs!\" \"Why didn't I have you do that instead of sending you to town, anyway?\" he grumbled as Paul went. \"For a bright man, I haven't much sense!\" THERE'S the plane!\" Paul raced from the patio toward the desert pasture. \"That's Groneman, all right!\" \"That's a soft landing field.\" \"He'll make it! Things too regular!\" \"That's a perfect landing if I ever saw one!\" Paul cried. \"Look at the cowboys scatter; they expected the plane to bounce all over the country and end up in a bed of prickly pears.\" Paul was already halfway to the pasture; Dr. Potsworth hurried after him as fast as his shorter legs would take him, puffing and wheezing like his old car in a sand rut. Fifteen minutes later the two doctors were in Janet's room, holding a consultation. \"Why did you send for me, Potsworth? You had this catalogued.\" Dr. Groneman had been watching Janet intently for several minutes. Exactly the same expression was on his face that Potsworth's had worn when he first saw her. \"Tm gettin' old and seedy, Mark. Been out here so long I can't tell mumps from whooping cough.\" \"You're as good an authority as we have on this sort of thing, Potsworth, I may as well go back, for any good I'll be. But I'd like to stick around and watch you work. How could anybody get nerve exhaustion in a place like this? It's the top of the world!\" \"Let's turn the patient over to your nurse and take a little of it in,\" Potsworth said. \"I've been glued to this spot for-two days. I'm mighty thankful to have a nurse on the scene. Even our Indian woman was - gone when I got here.\" There followed days of waiting. Paul worked tirelessly at insignifcant things, saying little. Janet roused occasionally to a state that bordered consciousness, but most of the time she slept a detached, He doesn't like TOMORROW'S CUP feather-like sleep. 'The household lived on tiptoe. On the fifth morning, Paul followed Dr. Potsworth into the yard. Dawn was breaking, rose-hued over the desert. Wind brushed against his face with sympathetic coolness. Paul neither saw nor heard. \"I can't stand this any longer, Doc,\" he said. \"I thought I'd feel better if I didn't know the worst, but I don't. Nothing could be worse than the things I conjure up. What is it both you and Groneman imply, yet do not say, even between yourselves? What is it you fear?\" \"Paralysis.\" The word cut the air like hawk wings. Paul felt the pressure of blood in every vein of his body. Potsworth took his arm and they went back to the house. At the door Paul said doggedly: \"If we could get her to a hospital\" \"We've discussed that endlessly, Groneman and J. We both agree that her chance is still in perfect quiet. If labor will hold off a few more days, the odds will be on her side. The shock of childbirth now 'might be too much.\" \"And the. Baby?\" Paul asked it, dreading the answer. \"Several days overdue. That's the chance we have to take. Nature's pretty sensible, we can but help her out.\" \" Paul pressed the doctor's hand and went slowly toward the store. \"It's awfulthis waitingthis uselessness,\" he muttered. '\"My fingers itch to clutch the hair of a redskin, any one of them, just so I'll feel like a man again!\" But he'd given Doc his word not to go gunning for Mike, and he'd keep it. To the disgust of 477 the cowboys, he'd called off the posse. Only Indian Joe was left to dog Mike's trail. And Joe would do it. If only Juanee would talk! But until Joe came back she would not do that. She had been to her father's hogan and found them gone, hide and baggage, that's all Juanee would say. She cried silently by day and chanted from her hogan by night. Paul awoke to a gray day. By noon a storm broke over the desert. 'Trees turned somersaults. Rocks shivered and broke loose from the cliffs as thunder rocked the clouds into a downpour of rain. Burnteyed, Paul watched it come; watched Janet, too. Groneman stood looking out of the window. \"Will this be a shock?\" he asked Dr. Potsworth, indicating Janet. \"On the contrary. 'This is something she can understand. She's heard the roar of surf against rocks; rain dripping from the roof; rivers on the rampage. This will be home to Janet.\" \"There's never been a rain like this since Janet came here,\" Paul said. \"II hope you're right.\" At the height of the storm Janet's baby came, living barely an hour, then Janet fell into a restful, natural sleep. \"She'll be all right now, Paul,\" Groneman said. \"She'll remember little of this.\" Grief overshadowed Paul's eyes. \"Thenthen Janet will never sense her lossnor know the glory of motherhood?\" Potsworth sighed. \"She may or may not have another child.\" 478 Paul dug the tiny grave on a knoll overlooking El Toro, where it would catch the first and last rays of every sun. Alone, he carried the tiny casket to the little cemetery he had made. Janet knew that in the dim hours of the dawn she had held her baby in her arms; then they had taken it away.... When she was able to go out into the living room again it was May. The spring was full of golden days, the desert sweet with them. (To be continued) << Food Preservation (Continued from page 470) Many homes have good storage facilities. A cool, ventilated cellar under the house offers good conditions for storage of vegetables. Cellars with heating furnaces are usually too warm and dry, but often a room may be partitioned off where the temperature may be controlled by outside windows. Natural earth makes a better floor than concrete or brick because a certain amount of moisture is necessary. Outdoor storage cellars or caves are excellent for storing vegetables. Many farms have this type of cellar. It is built partly underground and offers protection from freezing, and keeps vegetables and apples in excellent condition. Write to the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Farmer's Bulletin No. 879, for the construction details of many types of cellars. We found a very simple method of storage quite satisfactory last year for keeping our Victory Garden products. Carrots, beets, turnips, and onions were put in boxes and bushel baskets, a lid placed over these containers, and holes dug in the garden soil to a little below the depth of each container, then leaves and a very small amount of soil were heaped over the containers. When we needed the products the leaves were removed, but replaced again after getting the desired amount. 'These vegetables kept very well until they were all used, sometime in January. This was a very simple method for the small amount of excess vegetables we had grown during the summer. Bibliography Stark, A.

Some minutes after the tardy bell had rung, Robin Marshall hurried in and slipped into his seat. \"Late again,\" Lois announced. \"This will never do, Robin. You bring down our record.\" Robin hung his head. \"He's always clean, at least,\" Lois thought as she noticed his nicely ironed blue coveralls with the folded handkerchief peeping from the breast pocket, and his blond curls brushed smooth. She couldn't say as much for most of her pupils. There was no excuse for letting children come to school dirty with their shoes untied and their hair not combed. She could hardly bear to look at some of them and nothing could have induced her to touch them. \"Readerspage 6,\" she commanded. Then began the monotonous repetition, \"I see the dog. The dog can run. I see the cat. The cat can jump.\" \"Next, Robin.\" When he did not begin, Lois looked at him in surprise. He never lost the place and he was a good reader. \"Robin,\" she repeated. \"The cat,\" he began, \"c can \" She looked more closely. Big tears were falling on his book. \"Carl,\" she said out loud, but she? Thought, \"The big baby. Oh, why did I ever accept this job? I don't know anything about children of this age. Why didn't they put me in high school where I belong?\" Lois got through the day somehow. Everything seemed to go wrong. Again and again Robin failed to recite. \"The child must be sick,\" she thought. Usually he was all enthusiasm and smiles. When she came back from escorting the children to the door that afternoon, Lois sat down wearily, her head in her hands. This school had the reputation of being the least desirable school in town and it seemed to Lois that it was living up to its reputation. Miss Thomas, the second grade teacher, a woman past thirty-five, came in to borrow some colored chalk. \"How do you stand it?\" Lois stormed. \"You've been here ten years.\" \"Oh, it's a job,\" Miss Thomas answered listlessly. \"Not much is expected here.\" She helped herself from the box on the desk. \"Well, I don't intend to waste my life on such children,\" Lois went on, \"Tl make such a record that the supervisor will notice and transfer me.\" She took up some pictures she had brought that morning and began to tack them to the wall. One was of a rosy-cheeked boy sliding downhill on his sled. His happy smile made her think of Robin again. What was the matter with the child, anyway? He was the one Page 479 480 bright spot in her day, usually, but lately he had failed her. If she was going to make a record, she had better begin with him. Lois put on her new squirrel coat and pulled her scarlet tam over her dark curls. Going back to the desk, she turned through her roll book and found Robin's address318 Sherman Streetnot too far to walk. She would go and have a talk with his mother.: Lois walked rapidly, for the wind was cold. As she approached the railroad tracks, she noticed that the snow got dirtier and dirtier and scraps of paper blew about. A shrill whistle sounded, and gates appeared from nowhere across her path. A long freight train moved by. Could a train have delayed Robin, she wondered? She must remember to caution the children. She had better not urge them to hurry. By the time the street was clear again, Lois was cold. She walked rapidly and soon found the number she sought. The porch was covered with muddy dog tracks. An old woman opened the door a few inches. \"Im looking for Mrs. Marshall,\" Lois explained. \"She lives at the back,\" the woman snapped, and closed the door. Lois went round the house. The snow had been cleared away but there was no pavement. Seeing a door at the side, she knocked. The door was opened by a young woman scarcely older than Lois. She smiled and Lois said confidently, \"You are Robin's mother.\" \"And you are his teacher.\" The woman stepped back courteously. \"He has told me about your lovely coat. Come inwon't you?\" Lois stepped in and was immediately sorry she had not taken off her galoshes for the bare floor was spotless. Mrs. Marshall drew a plain wooden rocker towards the range. \"Sit here,\" she said, \"you must be cold.\" Lois noticed that the room, though small, served as kitchen, dining room and living room. 'There was very little furniture. Some clothes hung on a line over the stove. '\"Won't you take off your coat?\" Mrs. Marshall asked as she put a shovel of coal on the fire. \"No,\" Lois answered. \"I can't stay. I just came to ask why Robin has been tardy so often lately.\" Just then a wail came from the clothesbasket on the table. Mrs. Marshall took out a tiny baby and held it to her shoulder. Then she began. \"Wellyou see. I'm very sorry. It's my fault, I supposenot manag-. Ing.\" She stopped and fussed with the baby's blanket. \"It must be hard to get small children up in the morning,\" Lois offered. \"Oh, that isn't it.\" Again a pause followed. \"It's just that it's so hard to dry his coveralls.\" I don't understand,\" Lois said. \"Well, you see, I can't wash them till he goes to bed. It was all right when I could hang them out but now they don't get dry.\" The baby cried again so the young mother walked back and forth. Lois waited because she did not know what to say. Hesitatingly Mrs. Marshall continued, \"We've been short of coal (Continued on page 521) Can Your Stake Increase Magazine Subscriptions? General Secretary-Treasurer Vera White Pohlman N 1921, when Thewas in its eighth year, the General Board was faced with the necessity of increasing the subscription price because of higher costs of printing during and after World War I. Relief Society women throughout the Church, eager to maintain the subscription price at one dollar per year, pledged themselves to increase the circulation so that the price need not be raised. They fulfilled this pledge and the price has been maintained at one dollar per year ever since. Furthermore, a steadily increasing circulation has made it possible to offer a bigger and better Magazine during the past few years, still at the dollar rate. Now, in its thirtieth year, the Magazine is again threatened with a higher subscription priceagain because of increased costs due to war conditions. And again the circulation must be greatly increased in order to avoid raising the subscription price. The General Board believes that Relief Society members, officers, and Magazine representatives will give every possible support to the Magazine in order that its present high quality may be maintained without increasing the subscription price, just as did the Relief Society women of nearly a quarter century ago. In order that the various stakes and missions may fully realize their present Magazine subscription rates and the great opportunity for extending the circulation, Magazine subscriptions in relation to Relief Society members are listed in the accompanying table and pictographs for all stakes and English-speaking missions of the Church which submitted the official annual Relief Society report to the General Board. The chart lists all stakes in alphabetical order, followed by the Englishspeaking missions. Opposite the name of each stake and mission is a row of 20 symbolssome dark and some lighteach representing 5 per cent of the Relief Society members in the stake or mission. The dark symbols represent the proportion of members who subscribed for the Magazine in 1942; the light symbols represent the proportion of members who did not subscribe for the Magazine IN 1942. The General Board has never required a specified quota of Magazine subscriptions from the various stakes, wards, and missions, but it has recognized, in the honor roll and by award subscriptions, those Societies whose subscriptions equalled or exceeded 75 per cent of their members. Accordingly, the charts show an achievement line at the 75 per cent point. From this line, stakes and missions may observe the extent to which their 1942 Magazine subscriptions approached or exceeded this point. If every stake and English-speaking Page 48] 482 mission whose subscription rate is less than 75 per cent of the membership will make an effort to increase subscriptions toward this point, it should be possible to keep the Magazine subscription price at one dollar per year. At the end of each row of symbols is a rank number by means of which the corresponding stake or mission may be found in the preceding table, listed in order according to percentage of Magazine subscriptions in relation to members. This table shows, as of 1942, the number of members, number of Magazine subscriptions, and the percentage of subscriptions to members. It also shows the number of subscriptions to be procured during the calendar year 1943 in order for the stake or mission to have a subscription rate equal to 75 per cent of its members, together with the approximate number of Latter-day Saint women in the stake or missionfrom all of whom Magazine subscriptions may be solicited. For example, for the 161 stakes and missions included in the table and chart, a total subscription list of 75,157 would be required to represent 75 per cent of the 100,320 members of Relief Society in these stakes and missions, but there are approximately 165,813 Latter-day Saint women in these same stakes and missions from whom to procure the 75,157 subscriptions. Similar computations may be made in the stakes and missions with respect to their local Relief Societies.\nAttention is especially directed to the annual report in the June-July issue of the Magazine, to the table at the bottom of page 425 showing the extent to which Relief Society officers and class leaders subscribe for the Magazine. This table shows that nearly all (97 per cent) of stake officers and board members subscribe for the Magazine, that nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) of the executive officers in wards and branches are Magazine subscribers, and that 81 per cent of the class leaders take the Magazine. Figures are available in every stake, ward, and mission Relief Society annual report for 1942 from which local rates may be computed.\nAll subscriptions procured by the local Magazine representatives may be included in the count of subscriptions, whether or not the subscribers are members of Relief Society, and also those subscriptions procured within the boundaries of each local ward or branch which are mailed elsewhere, such as gift subscriptions.\nIt should be borne in mind that as the number of members increases or decreases during 1943, the subscription percentage will also fluctuate. For example, if a stake procures the number of subscriptions listed in the table as representing 75 per cent of the members, the subscription rate for this stake at the end of 1943 would be less than 75 per cent if the number of members has increased, or more than 75 per cent if the number of members has decreased. Magazine representatives should therefore check frequently with their Relief Society secretaries to ascertain the current membership count.\nTHE high-ranking stakes and missions which procured Magazine subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of their members for 1942 head the table. These are the Australian and the Western States Missions, and South Los Angeles, San Diego, Big Horn, San Francisco, Union, Cassia, Phoenix, and Bear Lake Stakes. These stakes and missions are also represented in the Notes from the Field of this issue where they tell of methods used in achieving these rates.\nOf the total of 161 stakes and English-speaking missions listed in the table and charts, only these 10 report subscriptions equaling or exceeding 75 per cent of their members. It is especially noteworthy that the Australian Mission and the South Los Angeles Stake each procured subscriptions in excess of their membership. Also worthy of special mention are two districts of the Northern States MissionIllinois North and South with a percentage of 92, and Wisconsin with a percentage of 76, and the South Alabama district of the Southern States Mission with a percentage of 77. Mission districts are not listed separately in the table and chart because not all missions are organized into districts with respect to Relief Society work. These three high-rating mission districts were recognized, however, in the Magazine subscription honor roll in the May issue of the Magazine.\nEach year, local Relief Societies, as well as stakes and missions, whose subscriptions to theequal or exceed 75 per cent of the Relief Society membership, are compiled into an honor roll and published in the Magazine. Each local Magazine representative achieving this goal is awarded a one-year gift subscription to the Magazine. This honor roll is based on the annual Magazine subscription reports submitted by local, stake, and mission Magazine representatives.\nA total of 383 localrepresentatives achieved a place on the honor roll for 1942 and were awarded gift subscriptions, as shown on the honor roll in the Magazine for May 1943, supplemented by the June-July issue, page 412. But these 383 local Relief Societies (284 of them in stakes and 99 in missions), represented only 17 per cent of the total of 2,273 local Relief Societies throughout the Church. Only 8 or 6 per cent of the 144 stakes achieved a rating of 75 per cent, and only 2 of the missions. The missions, however, cannot all be compared in this respect, inasmuch as several of them are in non-English-speaking countries, and reports from some of the English-speaking missions in faraway places could not reach us under wartime shipping conditions.\nMany of the local Relief Societies failed to submit subscription reports to their stake or mission officers, and the General Board received no compiled reports from 99 of the stakes nor from some of the missions from which reports could have reached the office. It is unfortunate that in some of these non-reporting stakes and missions there were local Magazine representatives who had achieved excellent Magazine subscription rates but whose records did not reach the General Board for inclusion in the honor roll either because the local Relief Society failed to submit its report or because the stake or mission failed to send in the compilation.\nThe rates shown are based on members and subscriptions as shown\nCAN YOUR STAKE INCREASE MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS? 483\n484\nin the regular annual report. These figures should have been exactly the same as those submitted on the subscription reports fromrepresentatives, but these figures were in agreement in only about one-fourth of the stakes and missions. In all remaining stakes and missions either the count of members or count of subscriptions was in conflict in the two reports. This is surprising inasmuch as there was only one source of information for each figureMagazine representatives were instructed to procure the count of members as of December 1, 1942 from their respective Relief Society secretaries, and secretaries were instructed to procure the count of subscriptions from their respective Magazine representatives. The regular annual Relief Society report must necessarily be considered as the official report and therefore the figures as printed may not agree in all instances with figures submitted by Magazine representatives, including those printed in the honor roll. It is conceded that in many instances the number of subscriptions as reported by Magazine representatives may have been more accurate than the number shown by the secretary on the annual report, but without evidence to this effect the only alternative is to accept for this purpose the figures in the regular annual report. It is hoped that the recognition of this discrepancy will lead to more accurate reports for 1943.\nDiscrepancies of this sort account for inclusion in the honor roll of two stakes which on the basis of the annual report are not shown in the accompanying table and chart as having achieved a goal of 75 per cent or more.\nTABLE SHOWING, FOR 1942,SUBSCRIPTIONS IN RELATION TO RELIEF SOCIETY MEMBERS In 144 Stakes and 17 English-speaking Missions\nRANK\nSTAKE OR MISSION\nMAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS IN RELATION TO MEMBERS\nSubscriptions to equal 75 Per cent of Members\nEstimated Number of L.D.S.

Spafford\nTHEis published monthly by the General Board for the spiritual, educational, and cultural advancement of Latter-day Saint women, and to further the work of Relief Society. In order for the Magazine to fulfill its purpose, three divisions of Magazine work must be well done:\nFirst, the Magazine itself must be a publication of merit. Contents must be well selected and carefully edited; they must be interesting and profitable to Latter-day Saint women. The Magazine, from cover to cover, must be attractive to the eye, with every detail of such quality as to evoke the pride of publisher and Magazine representative alike; and subscribers should be able to readily recognize it as a high-class and valuable periodical. The publication of an attractive, worthwhile Magazine is made possible through the excellent contributions of gifted and authoritative writers, able artists, and a well-equipped Magazine staff.\nSecond, the Magazine must be extensively distributed among those for whom it is planned. No matter how splendid it may be, it is of little value unless circulatedand the wider its circulation, the greater is its value. A person will seldom make an effort to possess an article, irrespective of its worth, unless someone arouses his interest in it and points out that it has definite value to him as an individual. This is particularly true with regard to subscribing to a magazine. Someone must make the prospective subscriber\nPage 494\nappreciate the value of the magazine in relation to his needs; then, a subscription will usually be forthcoming. This work of distribution is the special responsibility of stake and ward officers and Magazine representatives.\nThird, the Magazine must not only be circulated, it must be read. Otherwise, it cannot fulfill the purpose for which it is published. Many people have the reading habit and read the Magazine thoroughly without any special stimulation; others read it because they feel a special need for certain information which it contains or for the recreation or entertainment which reading it provides; still others need to be frequently stimulated to read it, or they would seldom open its pages. It is safe to say that the average person reads that which is brought to his attention, and is exceedingly responsive to suggestions from those whose opinions he values. Relief Society officers, Magazine representatives, and Relief Society members may greatly stimulate Magazine reading by calling to the attention of the women, at every favorable opportunity, articles, stories, poems, etc., published in the various issues. Throughout the year, Magazine content should be kept before subscribers in an enthusiastic, converted way.\nAt this season of the year, the second important phase of Magazine work holds the special attention of many Relief Society officers and Magazine representatives. Although the time for the four-weeks intensive\nMAGAZINE PROMOTION WORK\nMagazine promotion work is optional, many stakes conduct this program during the fall months, September and October.\nIn planning this program, one question is uppermost: \"How may we be successful in selling the Magazine?\" Someone has said, \"He who is mentally equipped with a thorough knowledge of the goods he sells and a study of human nature, who possesses an attractive personality, enjoys good health, is absolutely honest, and in love with his work, can hardly fail to make a successful salesman.\"\nIN approaching her work, perhaps the first consideration of the Magazine representative is to determine who may be regarded as prospective subscribers. Theis not for Relief Society members alone, but is needed in the home of every Latter-day Saint woman. Every woman in the ward who is not already a subscriber should be regarded as a prospective subscriber. Prospective subscribers might profitably be classified; for example, the probable, the less probable, and the least probable. It has been estimated by successful sales organizations that the most hopeful group of prospects yields fifty times the results over the least hopeful group, in proportion to the time and energy expended.\nIt is recognized that certain advance information is valuable in selling; for example, the name, the size of the family, approximate ages of family members, the interests, ambitions, and needs of the family, their Church auxiliary affiliations, etc. The Magazine representative should also know the names of those who are\n495\nalready subscribers and the expiration dates of their subscriptions; the names of those who have been but who are not now subscribers and, if possible, the reasons why their subscriptions were discontinued.\nSuccessful Magazine representatives have a clear idea of Magazine content and a strong conviction of the worth of the periodical. \"Know and value your merchandise\" is a must in successful selling. The Magazine representative should be sufficiently familiar with Magazine content to be able to tell enough of any article, story, etc., to interest a prospective subscriber and to enable that person to see the value of the publication in relation to her individual interests and needs.\nThe wise Magazine representative gives careful consideration to how best to present the worth of the Magazine in a clear, intelligent, and appealing manner. The special ideas and incitements that might be used with each individual to arouse in her a desire to subscribe are thought through and evaluated. Generally speaking, it is more effective to stress the values to be derived from receiving the Magazine month after month than to merely enumerate, article by article and story by story, the content of one or two issues. It is usually profitable to briefly review one or two articles or stories which strike a point of interest, but to deal with every bit of content, article by article, is highly impractical.\nIn calling upon a woman in the interest of securing a Magazine subscription, the experienced representative always carries copies of one or two issues of the Magazine with herone of these a current issue. People\n496\nlike to see what they are buying. Good judgment is used in getting a hearing. A time is selected for the interview that is convenient for the prospective subscriber and the visit is not extended too long. However, the representative endeavors not to appear rushed nor does she ever have a demanding attitude.\nIn selling it is advisable to appeal to the individual interests and needs of each woman solicited. Appeals that have been successfully used in selling Theare: (1) activity in Relief Society, (2) interest in homemaking, (3) desire for education, (4) desire to keep up with Church news and viewpoints, (5) desire to be familiar with movements, trends, and activities important to Latter-day Saint women, (6) ambitions for children, (7) need for high-class, entertaining reading matter. These are usually more effective appeals than just loyalty to Relief Society, although the loyalty appeal may be effective where others fail.\nThe appropriateness of the Magazine as a giftMother's Day, Christmas, birthday, etc.is an appeal which often results in a subscription.\nMagazine representatives occasionally encounter objections to buying; such as, \"I don't have time to read\"; \"I already subscribe for more magazines than I read\"; \"I can't afford to subscribe\"; \"I take the Era or The Children's Friend, and one Church magazine is enough,\" etc. The wise representative anticipates these objections and is fortified to dissolve them without argumentation; she has an answer ready that will casually set the objection at nought. A favorable comment of someone whose\nopinion is respected, often removes such an objection. Frequently, the strongest objections are overcome by leaving a sample copy of the Magazine in the home.\nCopies of some back issues are now available upon request at the office of the General Board, and representatives are urged to take advantage of this offer.\nBusiness-like procedure is extremely important in selling. A receipt book, a good pencil or other needed supplies should always be at hand and necessary information should be accurately recorded. Thus the representative wins the confidence of the subscriber and avoids mistakes.\nThe spirit with whichrepresentatives approach their work has perhaps been responsible for more sales than any other one factor. They regard their work as an important Relief Society call, far-reaching in its influence. They take pleasure in showing the Magazine, striving always to make a friend for the periodical and for Relief Society even though they may not always make a sale. They recognize in their assignment a work of service, worthy of their time and best effort.\nThe following articles published in Thecontain helpful suggestions for selling. While some of these articles deal primarily with suggestions for stimulating the work through the union meeting, they contain enough help for ward representatives to justify a careful reading of them.\n\"Service and Selling,\" Vida Fox Clawson, May 1938, page 336.\n\"The Magazine In the Mission,\" Lewella R.

These stakes and the Western States Mission were asked to send brief reports of methods used in achieving their high rates. The reports received are published herewith in the same order in which these stakes and mission are listed in the table, followed by one report from an additional stakeOakland.\nBecause of distance and time limitations, no report could be procured from the Australian Mission which stands at the head of all stakes and missions in the Church with a subscription rate of 122 per cent. This mission has had a consistently high rate during the past few years. June Cannon Orme is the mission Relief Society president and Violet Cook is the mission Magazine representative.\nSouth Los Angeles Stake (California)\nUNDER the direction of Stake Relief Society President Hazel Till NeVille, and her first counselor, Ruth Ryan, in charge of Magazine work, and Rosine Bauer, stake Magazine representative, the South Los Angeles Stake achieved a Magazine subscription rate of 102.5 per cent in 1942, exceeding its own excellent rate of 86 per cent of the year before. Following are excerpts from statements from these three leaders:\nFrom Hazel T. NeVilleWe are indeed happy our stake was so willing and able to achieve our goal of 100 per cent of our enrollmentto procure 872 subscriptions as compared with a membership of 851. This was accomplished through the fine leadership of Sisters Ryan and Bauer, and our faithful ward representatives. No high pressure methods were used. It seemed every one concerned felt it was a work of love. We, as a stake, feel the Magazine is greatly needed at this time. We need to be buoyed up in spirit, and to be reassured that all things work together for good in the lives of those who serve the Lord. The strongest appeal in our Magazine work was the self-help concept. The point of attack was what the Magazine had to offer in opportunities for spiritual uplift and intellectual growth. We felt it was our opportunity to plant and make grow a testimony of the Master's work, to stimulate women to think, to read, to act. We want our Relief Society women to really live, to discover for themselves the great sustaining power of a strong religious faith. We are proud of our workers' accomplishment and feel sure the Magazine will inspire and direct the women of our stake for good.\nFrom Counselor Ruth Ryan:\nGoal Set First a goal was set\"a Magazine for every member.\" Ward representatives and\nPage 497\n498\npresidents met with us and agreed upon this goal.\nMethods Used Special group assignments were carried out by means of names given to a group of women, each of whom was to call upon a number of homes and introduce Magazine. By this method one ward secured fifty new subscriptions.\nEncouraging letters were sent out to the wards each month enclosing a self-addressed postcard to return as a report on ward activity.\nExcerpt from Magazine given in Relief Society meeting once a month by a well-prepared person.\nTwo-and-one-half-minute talks on Sunday based on material in the Magazine, with no sales talk interjected.\nChecked with ward clerk monthly on new people in the ward so that they could be approached.\nMagazine left in the home for a brief time with articles marked that would attract reader's individual interest.\nAttention to Magazine as a lovely gift.\nLuncheons where Magazine representatives and ward presidencies met together to discuss ward problems and get complete outline of how to accomplish our goal.\nPoster displayed.\nPrize for most successful ward.\nFrom Rosine Bauer, Magazine RepresentativeIn 1942, the month of June was selected as the month for a campaign. All new families were to be contacted in all the wards to obtain as many new subscriptions as possible. All officers and visiting teachers were asked to cooperate and give their support. There was a two-fold purpose in having this campaign in June: First, the new subscriber receives the July issue which contains the first lessons for the coming year; Second, a June campaign does not conflict with campaigns for other Church magazines.\nThorough instructions and helpful suggestions were given to ward Magazine representatives at special meetings and by means of mailed material. Great emphasis is given to the importance of following up promptly on renewals as they occur from month to month. It is realized that the united effort of stake and ward officers, as well as of the Magazine representatives,\nis essential to accomplishment of the established goal and that it is important for the Magazine representative to realize that the Magazine is a valuable spiritual, and temporal guide to its readers.\nGift subscriptions were received at Theoffice at Christmas time in 1942 from each of the thirteen officers and class leaders of the Walnut Park Ward of the South Los Angeles Stake. These were for Relief Society women in faraway places or missionaries.\nSan Diego Stake (California)\nMARY McKAY CHRISTIANSEN, president of San Diego Stake Relief Society, whose first counselor, Carolyn Westover, also serves as stake Magazine representative, submitted the following report:\nThe degree of success attained by San Diego Stake in the Magazine campaign was due to the close cooperation of stake and ward representatives, checking on expirations as listed on the pink slips, monthly reports of progress, and frequent suggestions on methods of obtaining new subscriptions. Giving encouragement to representatives, and having them feel the importance of their position, gave stimulus to their efforts. When the stake preparation meeting was held at the beginning of the season's work, they were part of the group receiving instructions. A luncheon held between sessions, where they were especially honored for their achievements, was a fitting climax to a program given on the merits of the Magazine. The visiting teachers on their monthly calls have opened a way for subscriptions by drawing attention to articles printed in the Magazine and explaining the benefits and pleasure of having it in the home. With the added support of bishops and the cooperation of all Relief Society women, the Magazine campaign was brought to a successful close, which after all is only a challenge for bigger and better accomplishments. NOTES FROM THE FIELD Big Horn Stake (Wyoming) BIC HORN. STAKE of which Hulda M. Lynn is stake Relief Society president, is another stake which has maintained a high Magazine subscription rate for several years. Ann E. Gwynn, the stake Magazine representative, writes: Early in 1940, we divided our stake into two geographical sections, and called meetings at both places to which we invited the ward presidents and counselors, the ward Magazine representatives, and any others who would care to come. These meetings were in charge of our stake Magazine representative. 'The purpose was to instill into the minds of the sisters the need for the Magazine, and the benefit to them if they would study its contents. Our stake Relief Society president and all board members pledged themselves to help in every way they could, by taking more than one subscription and in other ways. This enthusiasm seemed to carry over to the ward presidents, their officers, and ward Magazine representatives, who in turn worked out ways and means to make it possible for the sisters to get the Magazine. We found that when we were all enlisted for the single purpose of selling our Magazine to the sisters, and with it our Relief Society work, that in unity there is strength, that our Heavenly Father did bless our efforts, as He will continue to do if we are humble and prayerful. Four wards of Big Horn Stake, Worland, Burlington, Kane, and Basin Branch sent gift subscriptions during 1942 to be distributed at the discretion of the Magazine office to missionaries or others in need of the Magazine. San Francisco Stake (California) LOUISE E. ARNSTEN, who serves both as secretary and Magazine representative of the San Francisco Stake, under direction of 499 Stake Relief Society President Esther D. Stephens, reports: Any success that we have had along this line was due particularly to the efforts put forth by our ward representatives. Our stake is a large one in distances covered. Some of our wards cover an area of 30 miles. Due to the restrictions placed upon travel in these days, I, as stake representative, have not been able to contact them personally, as we did formerly. During our intensive drive, which we hold from June fifteenth to July fifteenth each year, we meet together at one of the homes for a luncheon meeting. Here each of the ward representatives outlines her past methods as well as those she intends to employ during the current drive. Ideas are exchanged in this manner. I have always found that the ward representatives keep an accurate personal record of the subscriptions in their respective wards. Each of them has been very faithful in keeping in contact with her subscribers and sceing to it that subscriptions are renewed and kept up to date, as well as obtaining new ones. As has been mentioned before, they are lirnited as to travel facilities. Many of them are actively engaged in numerous activities outside their homes and Church now, such as Red Cross, and defense work, or at least some members of their immediate families are, all of which causes them to have less time than ever before. In spite of these handicaps, however, they are doing their work faithfully and well. We are very proud of the fact that Sister Josephine Danford of Sunset Ward was able to obtain 104 per cent. She, as well as all the representatives, made use of the telephone as well as personal visits to obtain subscriptions. What is of most value is that each of the representatives, herself, is enthusiastic. About the Magazine. 'They have all had the advantage of having it in their own homes for many years, and therefore realize its value, and are able to sell it to others. Union Stake (Oregon) HE following comment on the Magazine campaign in Union 500 Stake is from Mildred S. Snider, stake secretary-treasurer: We first attribute our success with the Magazine to the very high quality of the Magazine itself, which makes it very desirable to our members; next, to the diligence and untiring efforts of our ward representatives. From reports from our wards we find which are up on their quota, keep a record of the Magazines, and contact each subscriber a month preceding the expiration date. One of our outstanding representatives gave a few minutes' talk each month at work-andbusiness meeting on the most interesting articles in the current Magazine. All these methods helped to reach the goal. Ellen S. Bean is stake Relief Society president and Della Rees is stake Magazine representative. Cassia Stake (Idaho) SOCIETY MAGATINE ANE R. HALE, Cassia Stake jue Magazine representative, writes: The success of thedrive was attained through the interest and efforts of the ward Magazine representatives, also the support and cooperation of Relief Society officers and members. A thorough house-to-house canvass was made in each ward, and with a determination to teach a high percentage, the representatives worked constantly at the drive. The Magazine was also featured in ward Relief Society conferences by a special number on the program. Annie M. Mercer is Relief Society president of this stake. Western States Mission LUCEAL R. CURTIS, mission Relief Society president, writes as follows of methods for promoting Magazine subscriptions, both those which proved successful in 1942 and those planned for the 1943 campaign: When it was so apparent that transportation would be limited, that all forms of activity would be greatly curtailed, that more and more families would, of necessity become stay-at-homes, we took definite THERMOMETER CHART USED IN 1942 MAGAZINE CAMPAIGN IN WESTERN STATES MISSION Branching from the central thermometer for the entire mission are thermometers of two paired mission districts, each with horizontal bars representative of its branch Relief Societies. Steps to follow the counsel given by the General Authorities, to place good reading material in the homes of the Latter-day Saints. We took as our slogan, \"Every Relief Society member a Magazine subscriber and reader.\" To help us accomplish our project we employed the spirit of friendly competition and visual aids, as follows: NOTES FROM THE FIELD A large chart was prepared based on the thermometer idea, with a picture of a thermometer for each district and each Relief Society within each district in the Western States Mission. Each district was paired off to compete with a district of comparable size, and each Relief Society had a thermometer chart for the district to which it belonged as well as for the competing district. (The accompanying illustration shows the chart for one of these pairs of mission districts, with bars showing rates for each of the branches in these districts. The large chart for the entire mission was an extension of this diagram.) 'The progress made was marked up in red on the thermometer at the end of each two-week period, both on the master chart at the mission headquarters and on the individual charts. Frequent encouraging bulletins kept the mercury soaring. These charts were introduced at our annual Relief Society conferences in the various districts, and nearly all Magazine representatives were ready for the start on September 1. These charts were displayed prominently in the branch meeting places, with a list of the names of the women whose subscriptions had been entered. Husbands and children asked questions about the list and, as a result, many gift subscriptions were given to mothers, grandmothers, daughters, shut-ins, etc., in our mission. While we did not quite reach our goal of having 100 per cent of the Relief Society members subscribe for the Magazine, many branches went way over the 100 per cent mark and, as a result, 76 per cent of the Relief Society members in this mission are blessed with thein their homes. We were working for a record because of the increased spirituality in the homes of our Latter-day Saints as this excellent material is made available. For the 1943 campaign, we have an alarm clock chart of which a mimeographed copy, with movable hands, will be on display in every branch Relief Society. (See accompanying illustration.) The large hand will point to the mission percentage and the short hand to the branch percentage. The alarm will ring the first day of September for all Western States Magazine representatives to start for another year to place 501 ITS ALARMING BUT ITS TRUE ITS TIME TO RENEW OR BUY A NEWALARM CLOCK CHART FOR 1943 MAGAZINE CAMPAIGN IN WESTERN STATES MISSION Movable hands point to percentage of Magazine subscriptions in relation to membersthe short hand to the rate in the branch displaying the chart and the long hand to the rate for the entire mission. Choice literature in the homes of Relief Society members. We will try to gain the 100 per cent mark by midnight, November 30, 1943. We have set the date at November 30 so that we might get a complete report to the General Board by the last day of December. Weare sure that the fine groups of women in the Western States Mission, having tasted the benefits of last year's Magazine in their homes, will again respond to our Magazine goal. \"Twice Blessed,\" a short skit used by the Western States Mission, in, connection with its 1942 Magazine campaign, is on file in the office of the General Board. Copies of this skit will be issued without charge to 502 Relief Societies requesting them. This skit demonstrates good methods of salesmanship and can be easily produced. Phoenix Stake (Arizona) MILDRED SMITHSON, Phoenix stake Magazine representative, reports: Ourcampaign was held during the months of October and November. Plans and preparations for this drive were discussed at a luncheon and meeting held in my home. Those present were the presidents and Magazine representatives of each ward, Stake Relief Society President Mable Mortensen, and her counselors. As our theme we used Leah D. Widtsoe's statement, \"Theis always a good companion for me and when I read it faithfully I am always built up and feel that I can carry on, no matter what life may bring.\" We asked that each one carry this message to the members of the wards as they were visited. Sister Mortensen gave us a very inspiring and encouraging message. Each one present expressed her plans and intentions regarding her job. Many good ideas and suggestions were given to each other. At this meeting I became acquainted with the Magazine representatives for the first time. Since then, I have tried to keep in close touch with each one by telephone and visits. We took advantage of every opportunity to tell others about the Magazine and to encourage them to have it in their homes. I believe our success can be attributed to those sincere, steady, and energetic representatives who never overlooked an opportunity to renew a subscription or sell a new one. Bear Lake Stake (Idaho) AMY M. ATHAY, stake Relief Society president, and Gertrude R. Price, stake Magazine representative, jointly accounted for the success of the Magazine campaign in the Bear Lake Stake as follows: The good record of the Bear Lake Stake in putting over the Magazine drive for 1942 was largely the result of the achievements of the two previous years. For, when a ward has once gone \"over the top,\" pride in so doing helps much in the next year's campaign. Since union meetings were discontinued, where the Magazine department was held, other ways have been worked out for communicating with the ward Magazine representatives, although we all miss the union meetings. Some of the factors which have helped much are: correspondence, call by telephone, and personal visits by the stake. Magazine representative; in some wards, a complete canvass of the ward by the ward Magazine representative with regular followup work, especially checking of the slips sent out at the time of expiration of the Magazine subscriptions; the helpful, encouraging support of Relief Society ward presidents, who often get several subscriptions themselves; the dependable, untiring, enthusiastic ward Magazine representatives, the alert checking, kindly assistance and support of the Relief Society stake president, Magazine representative, and other stake officers, have all been effective; the appreciation for fine reading in the Magazine, the enjoyment of the lessons, the true spirit of Relief Society work manifest by the majority of our sisters helped us reach our goal. Oakland Stake (California) \"VWVE Buy OUR Magazine to READ.\" Ruth S. Hilton, president of Oakland Stake Relief Society writes that this is the new slogan for this stake's Magazine publicity work. She continues: Various members of our stake board have prepared splendid short talks on various articles, editorials, or bits of verse appearing in the current issues and then we've found occasions where these talks would be given before groups of women. We hope that by stimulating the actual study of our Magazine and treasuring many of its finest messages, we will have no need to say very much about the subscription list. This list should take care of itself if we all read and read intelligently each issue, COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE REPRESENTATIVES NTERESTING comments from stake and ward Magazine representatives were published in the May issue of the Magazine, pages 353 and 354, preceding the honor roll. Here are two additional statements: From Los Angeles Stake Jen Sasine, Magazine representative of Arlington Ward, the only ward in the stake which appears on the honor roll, wrote after receipt of the May issue of the Magazine: I'd like to express my appreciation for having won a place on the honor roll in the May Magazine. For the past three years I have worked in the Relief Society, and this year was my first as Magazine representative. I have enjoyed my work very much because it gave me the opportunity of knowing the sisters in the ward much better. From Cache Stake Lettie B. Rich, Magazine representative of Cache Stake, sent the following comment which _highlights the enthusiasm and determined effort of the several hundred local Magazine representatives in the stakes and English-speaking missions of the Church: One of my Magazine representatives called today for material. I asked her how she was getting along. She replied, \"Fine, I have a good pair of legs and a bike so I'm going to put my time to good advantage.\" That surely is the spirit that will carry us through. GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS THE largest gift subscriptions received during 1942 for distribution at the discretion of the Magazine office to those in need of the Magazine came from wards of the South Los Angeles and Big Hom Stakes, as already mentioned along with the preceding reports from those stakes. We acknowledge here other generous gift subscriptions received from the Littlefield Ward of the Moapa Stake, Farmington Ward of the South Davis Stake, and North 20th Ward of the Ensign Stake. These gift subscriptions have been received with great appreciation by those to whom they were sent, principally missionaries and officers of new mission branch Relief Societies who may not have been able to subscribe immediately themselves.

Simultaneously the front door opened and closed with a bang. Things always happened with a bang, when Jimmie arrived.\n\"Gee! Grandmom, I just knew you would be baking bread.\"\n\"Now Jimmie, don't tell me you could smell this bread baking down at school.\"\n\"Not quite, but almost,\" laughed Jimmie.\nSomehow, although Grandma Baker would not admit it, even to herself, this brown-eyed, tousle-headed grandson was a special favorite of hers. Jimmie realized this and there was a deep affection between them.\n\"Don't suppose you have a slice or two of that bread to spare?\"\nDespite the wishful tone of Jimmie's voice, Grandma was sure that the sparkle in his eyes was still there. They both knew it would not be many minutes before the desired bread would be in Jimmie's hands.\n\"Grandmom, why don't more people bake bread? I think it has the best smell in the whole world.\"\n\"Yes, Jimmie, I think you are right. There is just something about the smell of home-baked bread that makes a body hungry.\"\nGrandma's thoughts began to wander. Yes, perhaps that was what was the matter with the world. It was hungry; not enough of the old\nPage 504\nthings left, the common things, the friendly things that brought folks closer together.\nGrandma's thoughts were quickly swept back to the present, as Jimmie started spreading the second slice of bread.\n\"Land sake, child, you won't want any dinner, eating all that bread.\"\n\"Oh yes I will, Grandmom. By the time I play ball over in the vacant lot for a couple of hours I'll be starved.\"\nThen after a thoughtful pause, Jimmie continued. \"Just think, Grandmom, all this nice bread and not a slice of it rationed. Bet there are a lot of kids who wish they had some.\"\nGrandma smiled, and put her arm around the boyish shoulders. \"I guess there are, Jimmie, we are fortunate. Have you ever stopped to think how many wonderful things there are in this world that are not rationed? The blue sky, the flowers, the birds, the trees, and the sparkling brooks? Our kind Father in Heaven created all these fine things and they are ours, free to enjoy, but few people take time to appreciate them.\"\n\"Miss Jeffry, our geography teacher, told us that the whole map of the world may be changed after the war, and that if we win, the whole world will be free like we are. We will win, won't we Grandmom?\"\n\"Sure we will, Jimmie. This war is going to do a lot of harm, but it might do a lot of good also. It will make people realize that the best things in life are the common things.\"\n\nTheology\nArticles of Faith\nLesson 18The Gathering of Israel\nTuesday, November 2, 1943\n(This is the second of five chapters that deal with Article 10)\nArticle 10: \"We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes;...\"\nLesson Aim: To show that through the mercy of the Lord, Israel is being gathered.\nCONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 18, TALMAGE'S, ARTICLES OF FAITH\nThe Gathering Predicted\nDire as was the chastisement decreed on Israel for their waywardness, amounting as it did to their dissolution as a nation, wandering as outcasts among alien nations, who have never ceased to treat them with contumely and insult, they have been sustained by the sure word of promise that a day of glorious deliverance and blessed restoration awaits them.\nThe sufferings of Israel have been but necessary chastenings by a grieved yet loving Father, who planned by these effective means to purify His sin-stained children. Israel are not lost unto their God. In spite of their sin the Lord said: \"And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God.\" (Lev. 26:44; see also Deut. 4:27-31)\nAs complete as was the scattering, so shall be the gathering of Israel.\nBiblical Prophecies Concerning the Gathering\nAmong the early prophecies concerning the gathering of Israel we hear the Lord declaring that it shall come to pass that when thou, Israel, \"shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day... Thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul; That then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and\nPage 505\n506\ngather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee. If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee: And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.\" (Deut. 30:2-5)\nIsaiah spoke with no uncertain words of the assured return and reunion of scattered Israel. (Isaiah 11:11-13; 54:7-8)\nJeremiah also voiced the will and purpose of God concerning Israel's subsequent deliverance. (Jer. 16:12-16)\n\"Backsliding Israel,\" \"treacherous Judah,\" are the terms of reproof with which the Lord addressed His recreant people. \"Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.\" (See Jer. 3:12-18; also 23: 8; 25:34; 30:3; 32:37)\nEzekiel also declared the Lord's plan of Israel's restoration. (Ezek. 37:21-22; also 11:17; 20:34-42; 28:25; 34:11-13)\nAmos clearly evidences that the reestablishment is to be permanent. (Amos 9:14:15)\nJesus of Nazareth also spoke of this important event: \"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\" (Matt. 24:31)\nBook of Mormon Prophecies\nThe gathering of Israel claimed the attention of many prophets whose teachings are recorded in the Book of Mormon. We have noted\nLehi's discourse in the valley of Lemuel, in which that patriarch-prophet compared the house of Israel to an olive tree, the branches of which were to be broken off and scattered; now we may add his prediction regarding the subsequent grafting-in of the branches. (I Nephi 10:14; see also Jacob, Chap. 5.)\nNephi's predictions constitute some of the most comprehensive utterances concerning the restoration of the Jews. (1 Nephi 15:19-20; II Nephi 9:2; 25: 16-17, 20; also III Nephi 5:21-26; Chapter 29; Mormon 5:14)\nIt is evident from these and many other scriptures that the time of the full recovery or redemption of the Jews is to be determined by their acceptance of Christ as their Lord. When that time comes they are to be gathered to the land of their fathers; and in the work of gathering, the Gentiles are destined to take a great and honorable part. (II Nephi 10:7-9; 30:7; III Nephi 5:26; 20: 29-33; 21:21-27; Ether 13:8-10)\nLatter-day Revelation Concerning the Gathering\nLatter-day revelation concerning the gathering not only predicts the gathering of the saints to Zion, but announces that the hour for the gathering has come: \"Wherefore, prepare ye, prepare ye, O my people; sanctify yourselves; gather ye together, O ye people of my Church.... Yea, verily I say unto you again, the time has come when the voice of the Lord is unto you: go ye out of Babylon; gather ye out from among the nations, from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 133:4, 7;\n29:7-8; 31:8; 33:6; 38:31; 45:25; 77: 14; 84:2)\nExtent and Purpose of the Gathering\nIt is evident that the plan of gathering comprises:\n1. Assembling in the land of Zion of the people of Israel from the nations of the earth.\n2. Return of the Jews to Jerusalem.\n3. Restoration of the Lost Tribes.\nMoses, who was the representative of Israel's God when the Lord set His hand the first time to lead His people to the land of their appointed inheritance, came in person and committed to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the Ten Tribes from the land of the north.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 110:11)\nIsrael the Covenant People\nThe Lord has designated the people of Israel as especially His own. He covenanted with Abraham (Gen. 12:2, 3; 17:6-8; Gal. 3:14, 16), and confirmed the blessings upon Isaac\n507\n(Gen. 26:3-4) and in turn upon Jacob who was called Israel (Gen. 35: 11-12). And now in the day of gathering, the Lord is again bringing His people together to honor and bless them. The Redeemer was born in the flesh through the lineage of Abraham; and the blessings of that divine birth are extended to nations and every individual in mortality.\nRestoration of the Lost Tribes\nIt is thought that while many of those belonging to the Ten Tribes were diffused among the nations, a sufficient number to justify the retention of the original name were led away as a body. Their exodus from the north to Zion is an important part of the gathering. (Doctrine and Covenants 133:26-34)\nNote: Since the present location of the Lost Tribes has not been revealed, and there is a wealth of knowledge that has been revealed, it is deemed advisable that no discussions nor speculations be entered into concerning the present location of the Ten Tribes.\nSUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE\nSuggested Songs\n\"Guide Us O Thou Great Jehovah,\" by Robert Robinson-Annie F.

Since passages of scripture from the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants are essential to a discussion of this lesson, the class leader might appoint, well in advance of the presentation of the lesson, three committees, each committee to be responsible for the reading of passages from one of these three books.\n508\nEach committee should not exceed three in number including the chairman. At the time the lesson is presented, committees should sit in front of the class, grouped according to the book assigned to them. As the lesson proceeds, the class leader should call on committee members for desired passages bearing on the phase of the\nlesson under discussion. This will impress upon class members that the standard works of the Church all deal with the important subject of the gathering of Israel.\nClass members should be encouraged to bring their own books to class and as passages are read they should find them in their own books and follow the readings carefully.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nWe have been gathered to the valleys of these mountains for the express purpose of purifying ourselves, that we may become polished stones in the temple of God. We are here for the purpose of establishing the Kingdom of God on the earth. To be prepared for this work it has been necessary to gather us out from the nations and countries of the world, for if we had remained in those lands we could not have received the ordinances of the holy Priesthood of the Son of God, which are necessary for the perfection of the Saints preparatory to his coming. (Discourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925, page 186)\nThe Jews and JerusalemJerusalem is not to be redeemed by our going there and preaching to the inhabitants. It will be redeemed by the high hand of the Almighty. It will be given into the possession of the ancient Israelites by the power of God, and by the pouring out of his judgments. Jerusalem is not to be redeemed by the soft, still voice of the preacher of the Gospel of peace. Why? Because they were once the blessed of the Lord, the chosen of the Lord, the promised seed. They were the people from among whom should spring the Messiah; and salvation could be found only through that people. The Messiah came through them, and they killed him; and they will be the last of all the seed of Abraham to have the privilege of receiving the New and Everlasting Covenant. You may hand out to them gold, you may feed and clothe them, but it is impossible to convert the Jews, until the Lord God Almighty does it. By and by the Jews will be gathered to the land of their fathers, and the ten tribes, who wandered into the north, will be gathered home and the blood of Ephraim, the second son of Joseph, who was sold into Egypt, which is to be found in every kingdom and nation under heaven, will be gathered from among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles who will receive and adhere to the principles of the Gospel will be adopted and initiated into the family of Father Abraham, and Jesus will reign over his own and Satan will reign over his own. (Discourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925, pages 186-187)\nIn speaking of the gathering, we mean to be understood as speaking of it according to scripture, the gathering of the elect of the Lord out of every nation on earth, and bringing them to the place of the Lord of Hosts, when the city of righteousness shall be built, and where the people shall be of one heart and one mind, when the Savior comes; yea, where the people shall walk with God like Enoch, and be free from sin. (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, 1938, page 93.)\nThe greatest temporal and spiritual blessings which always come from faithfulness and concerted effort, never attend individual exertion or enterprise. The history of all past ages abundantly attests this fact. In addition to all temporal blessings, there is no other way for the Saints to be saved in these last days, (than by the gathering) as the concurrent testimony of all the holy prophets clearly proves, for it is written\"They shall come from the east, and be gathered from the west; the north shall give up, and the south shall\nkeep not back.\" \"The sons of God shall be gathered from afar, and his daughters from the ends of the earth.\" It is also the concurrent testimony of all the prophets, that this gathering together of all the Saints, must take place before the Lord comes to \"take vengeance upon the ungodly,\" and \"to be glorified and ad-\n509\nmired by all those who obey the Gospel.\" The fiftieth Psalm, from the first to the fifth verse inclusive describes the glory and majesty of that event. (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, 1938, page 183)\n\nVisiting Teachers\nMessages to the Home\nSources of Strength\nLesson 2Ordered Living\nTuesday, November 2, 1943\nTO live affirmatively, purposefully, abundantly, is possible for each of us, and to do it is a major achievement. To fill one's days with useful work, to do well the task immediately in front of one is to be happy now and to make secure the future. A well-ordered life is free from lost time, lost motion, desultory effort, and needless worry. Plan your work and work your plan, is a good motto. Well-organized, effective work is the panacea for most of the ills of life.\nBenjamin Franklin, one of the wisest and greatest Americans, followed consistently and successfully what he called \"the scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural day.\" His day was well-balanced and perfectly organized. He had rest, recreation, and work. In the morning he asked this question: \"What good shall I do this day?\"; and in the evening, this question: \"What good have I done this day?\" He lived a long and useful life and made a better contribution to the time in which he lived and to his country than almost any other man. He is one of the best examples in history of a self-made man.\nOne of the secrets of really great living is having ideals and standards and then living up to them. When we cherish lofty ideals and strive heroically to attain them, we are made both strong and happy. What we become depends in no small measure upon our ideals. We unconsciously approach the ideals which we love and cherish.\nLatter-day Saint women should exemplify the noblest womanhood, because they are the products of the ideals and standards of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They should be models of the finest motherhood, subscribing to the highest standards of Christian living. They should evidence a willingness to devote their lives to the service of others, and should be a constant source of encouragement and inspiration to those about them.\n510\nThe doctrine of eternal progression, as taught by the Latter-day Saints, should make us a great people. The knowledge that we lived before we were born and that we will live after we die, that we came here to be trained for a higher and better world, carries with it an impelling motive to noble endeavor that should register in the life and conduct of each of us.\nDiscussion\n1. What is your concept of a well-ordered life?\n2. What are the essentials of good living that should be included in one's plan of life?\n3. Why are standards and ideals important?\nReferences\nTeachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, edition 1938, pp. 53, 255-, p. 467\nDiscourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925, p. 329, paragraph 2\n\nHome Topics\nFor optional use on Work-and-Business Day\nModern Housekeeping Methods\nLesson 2Tools for Housecleaning Tasks\n(Care and Storage)\nTuesday, November 9, 1943\nHOUSEKEEPING is highly interesting and important work. Housecleaning can be brisk, efficient, and stimulating or it can be grim and time-consuming. Much depends on the tools at hand. The more efficient the tools, the faster the work. And, naturally, the results will be better, too.\nImportant items of cleaning equipment and materials include:*\nVacuum cleaner and attachments Carpet sweeper Applicator for floor wax Corn or fibre broom dust mop wet mop (string or cellulose sponge) scrubbing brush (long handle preferred) dust pan (long handle preferred) toilet-bowl brush Whisk broom or upholstery brush 2-4 treated dust cloths (combine 1 pint hot water and  cup lemon oil. Dip cheesecloth squares into solution. Press solution through cloth thoroughly; squeeze out excess moisture and then dry thoroughly) 6 cheesecloth squares (24\" by 24\") 2 flannel polishing cloths\n*For a more complete list, see America's Housekeeping Book, pp. 140-142. We must remember that this list represents the ideal, and many items are not obtainable at present due to the war.\n3 cellulose sponges (for kitchen, washroom, and cleaning basket) 2 floor cloths (for kitchen and bathroom) Silver polish Wax (paste, liquid or self-polishing) Lemon oil Mild scouring powder or whiting Toilet-bowl cleaner Carbon tetrachloride (dry cleaner) Household disinfectant Mild soap (chips, flakes, beads, grains) Paint cleaner\nCleaning tools are good servants only when they receive proper care. A vacuum cleaner lags on the job when the dust bag is clogged with dirt; a soiled duster or mop is little better than none at all; and a carpet sweeper can't pick up surface dirt if its brush is snarled with lint and hair, if the dust pans are filled to overflowing, or if the bristles are worn too short to touch the carpet. A few minutes a day spent in cleaning and caring for equipment will pay good dividends in service.\nCleaning Basket\nA small inexpensive open market basket with a handle makes an excellent cleaning basket which can be carried from room to room quite easily. A fitted oilcloth lining with pockets to hold small objects is easy to make, and helps to keep the basket in order. With a cleaning basket there will be no need for hurried trips back to the source of supply for forgotten items.\nCheck the contents with the following list before you start your cleaning program:*\nWhisk broom or upholstery brush (for brushing draperies and upholstery) 1 treated dust cloth (for daily dusting) 2 cheesecloth squares (for washing and drying woodwork)\n511\nCotton waste (for applying polishes and cleaners) 1 flannel polishing cloth (for rubbing or polishing) 1 cellulose sponge (for washing woodwork, walls, etc.) Art gum eraser (for removing soiled spots from walls or from lamp shades) Furniture polish or lemon oil or wax Mild scouring powder or whiting Carbon tetrachloride (dry cleaner) Scissors\nOne item that is generally overlooked in both house plans and apartment layouts is space to store cleaning equipment. Mops and brooms behind doors, the vacuum cleaner in the hall closet, dusters and polishing cloths tucked away in odd cornerssuch haphazard storage is the general rule, even though it means hundreds of extra steps and a great deal of petty annoyance. Perhaps you have always accepted this state of affairs, with definite irritation to be sure, but have never actually given much thought to a satisfactory solution.\nA careful study of floor and wall space will lead to ideas no matter how hopeless the situation may seem at first glance. On page 138 in our textbook, America's Housekeeping Book, you will find a good illustration of what can be done if you can find wall space 29 inches wide and 78 inches high, plus one shelf and one drawer in another location. This is not ideal, but it is a great improvement over half a dozen storage places. If you can find a corner space, so much the better. On page 139 of the textbook is shown an ideal storage closet for cleaning equipment which you may be able to build in some unused space.\n*For more complete list, see America's Housekeeping Book, p. 142.\n512\nOften there is an extra clothes closet on the first floor which is used for haphazard storage and which might well be transformed into an adequate cleaning closet. Closets can be made convenient through the addition of shelves, racks, drawers, and partitions at very little expense. Shallow shelves down one side, a shelf running the width of the closet within easy reach, clips for holding brooms, mops, etc. on the remaining wall space, on the door a shoe bag with pockets for holding dusters, floor space for the vacuum cleaner, carpet sweeper and pailand you have an orderly, efficient cleaning closet.\nOf course problems vary. Each homemaker must face her problem and work it out according to her circumstances. However, if you can find any space at all, you can with a little patience work out a satisfactory storage place. Be sure to place the tools that are used most often in the most accessible positions.\nAn hour or so spent in planning and working\nout storage space will be worth your while. \"A place for everything and everything in its place,\" is a first principle of law and order. Storage space that is both adequate and convenient, contributes a great deal to the efficiency of the homemaker.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Discuss: \"Cleaning tools are good servants only when they receive proper care.\" (Example: vacuum cleaner, dusters, carpet sweepers, etc.)\n2. What method have you used to successfully store household tools? In the light of the class discussion can you see room for improvement?\n3. To save time and energy, what method do you use for assembling tools and cleaning supplies in the room to be cleaned?\n4. A practical demonstration on the use and care of one or two specific cleaning tools might be interesting and helpful.\nReference\nAmerica's Housekeeping Book, Chap. 21, p. 131\n\nLiterature\nThe Bible as Literature\nLesson 2The Bible Epic\nTuesday, November 16, 1943\nEPIC and story in earlier times carried essentially the same meaning. Like lyric and song, the two words were practically synonymous. Through the long years, however, the term epic has acquired a more expansive meaning. As commonly used today, epic implies a composite story, with each part helping to develop the larger tale. Often the story group centers in some hero: as in the Odyssey, which depicts the adventures of Odysseus; or in Hiawatha, which portrays the\nlife story of a great Indian leader. Sometimes the epic deals with a distinctive phase of tribal or national life. Whatever its nature, however, it is made up of various stories, set together as spokes in a hub, or links in a chain, to effect the central purpose.\nA number of such \"story cycles\" or story groups are to be found in the Bible. At the beginning of Genesis, for example, is the epic-like Story of Creation. Following this, comes another story group dealing with the Deluge and its sequences. In another closely linked series of stories, the Patriarchal period is portrayed. Exodus opens the great epic of Moses. Around this leader, story after story is given to portray not only his life, but also the people whom he led out of bondage; and the development, during their wanderings, of a theocratic nation intent on the repossession of a \"Promised Land.\" After this comes another story series dealing with the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, and the varied fortunes of that realm under the leadership of different warrior chieftains, called Judges.\nYet another story group, epic in its spirit and sweep, portrays the rise of the kingdom of Israel. David, the shepherd boy, plays the leading role in this story cycle. Other interesting characters also have important parts; and many intriguing dramatic situations arise as the composite story develops.\nThis epic begins with a pastorala simple tale of devotion and romance set amid scenes of country lifethe story of Ruth. Most folk know this girl of old Moab as a faithful daughter-in-law, who, bereft of her\n513\nyoung Hebrew husband, clings to his mother and his religion. An oft-quoted passage from the Bible, Ruth's lyric plea to her mother-in-law, who has advised the girl to remain in Moab, begins:\nEntreat me not to leave thee, Or to return from following after thee: For whither thou goest, I will go; And where thou lodgest, I will lodge; Thy people shall be my people, And thy God my God. (Ruth 1:16)\nIt was not the literary charm of this classic story, however, that won for it the place of importance it holds in the Bible. It is there primarily because its heroine, Ruth, through her marriage with Boaz, became the ancestress of kings. The story opens an epic that still vibrates through all the world, a story that reaches from Ruth, through David, down to Mary and her divine Son, the Savior of Mankind. Read in this light, the story takes on new meaning.\nAnother charming mother-tale that weaves into this epic of Israel's kings is the story of Hannah and her little son, Samuel. This pure child, given to the temple, not only helps to keep God's house a holy place; but he rises to be a maker of kings. When the people, harassed by their enemies, clamor for a king, the Prophet Samuel at first denies their plea. But as they persist, he prays to the Lord for guidance, and the Lord tells Samuel, \"Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee; but they have rejected me that I should not rule over them.\" And Samuel, warning that the king will take away their sons and daughters for soldiers and handmaidens,\n514\ndeprive them of lands and substance, and burden them with taxes, finally gives them a king.\nTroubles, as the foolish folk were forewarned, begin to multiply. Saul, chosen largely because of princely bearing to be the first king of Israel, fails. He is more of a soldier than a saint. He assumes authority that belongs to the priesthood, and receives sharp warning from Samuel in the unforgettable words: \"To obey is better than sacrifice.\" (I Samuel 15:22)\nMeantime, David, the shepherd boy, through slaying Goliath, has won high favor with Saul. A deep friendship ripens between the youth and the king's son, Jonathan. Saul's daughter is given in marriage to David, then comes cankering jealousy in the heart of Saul. He forgets the source of real power, and seeks strange spirits. Samuel, meantime, instructed by the Lord, secretly anoints David king; but David, out of respect for God's anointed other king, will not assume the throne. Finally, Saul and Jonathan fall in battle, and the young warrior becomes king and builder of a greater kingdom of Israel, laying the foundation for his son Solomon to reign in all his glory.\nDramatic situations, crises and tragedies come to David. He sins and is severely rebuked by Nathan, the courageous prophet, for God is no respecter of persons. Yet David, unlike Saul, repents, and is permitted to carry forward, though not without punishment, to the close of his constructive reign.\nThese are but a few hints of this great Biblical epic. It rises to high literary qualities, moving with clar-\nity and force from beginning to close. Lyrical expressions add to its beauty in places; and lessons of life are concretely, impressively, portrayed. To feel its power and its artistry, however, one must read and reread the masterful story.\nDiscussion and Activities\nSelect as many as can be treated profitably in the allotted time.\n1. Name three or more individual stories that are woven together to make the epic-like story of the Patriarchs of Israel. (See Genesis, Chapters 12 to 50.)\n2.

What do you observe as to the story movement, the life-giving expressions, the music of the lines?\n4. (a) Why is this story properly placed between Judges and Kings? (b) What is the vital relationship that links Ruth with Mary, the mother of our Savior?\n5. Select from the epic of Saul and David some story of dramatic appeal. Read aloud passages which carry the loftiness and the sweep characteristic of epic literature. See I Samuel 21: 6-11.\n6. What vital lesson did Thomas Paine find in the story of Samuel, and use in his essay \"Common Sense\" to help stir our forefathers in their fight for freedom?\n7. Give a quotation from this epic of the Kings of Israel that has impressed on you a fundamental life lesson or religious truth.\n8. What individual story in the epic is a favorite with children?

He declared as citizens are good, so will government be good. Government grows out of the lives of people who inaugurate laws.)\nIN two short lessons on \"American Statesmen,\" this and the preceding lesson, we can only suggest a few of the outstanding men who have made contributions to our ideals of freedom and democracy. The men we have chosen for brief study took an active part in solving political problems that arose in our country. The men whom we will consider in this lesson are John Marshall, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, Abraham Lincoln, Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson, all of whom made important contributions to American political thought. Four of these men, Abraham Lincoln, Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson, became presidents of the United States. John Marshall was the greatest legal light that ever sat in the Supreme Court, and the other three, Webster, Calhoun, and Clay, composed the triumvirate who led the debates on important questions in the Congress of the United States previous to the Civil War.\nONE of the most outstanding characters of the American bar was John Marshall, the first Chief Justice of the United States. He was also an historian, soldier of the American Revolution, and an envoy at one time to England. Born in Virginia in 1755, he became of age two months after the Declaration of Independence was adopted, and took part in two of the principal campaigns of the American Revolution. He experienced the sufferings at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777-78. After the war, he began the practice of law, having taken lectures on law at William and Mary College in his native state. He gained distinction and was a member of the State Legislature of Virginia for many terms. In January 1801, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States where he did his noblest service to the nation. You will recall that it is the Supreme Court of the land that interprets the meaning of the Constitution when great cases of law are involved. In the first major case presented to him, he pro-\n516\nclaimed the final right of the judiciary to pass on the constitutionality of every act of Congress. This is why we call the judiciary of our Government the law-interpreting power. Marshall was noted for his simple ways of living, his honesty, and steadfastness to right. A lady said at his funeral: \"His great humility was the most impressive thing about his character.\" One of the most dramatic decisions handed down by Marshall was that of the Dartmouth College case in which Daniel Webster took part in defending his own Alma Mater. The Dartmouth College case grew out of the question as to whether or not the State Legislature of New Hampshire had the right to rescind the original charter granted in England in 1754.\nMANY a boy and girl has learned parts of the orations of Daniel Webster. Daniel Webster was among the greatest orators of his day, and served as United States senator from the state of Massachusetts for thirty years. His most noted opponents in the United States were John C. Calhoun of South Carolina and Robert Treat Hayne from the same state. Both Calhoun and Hayne opposed the policies of Webster in some of the most noted speeches ever made in the Senate. The questions at issue were that of States Rights, the protective tariff, and Negro slavery. The South had from the first stood for States Rights or the doctrine that a state has certain sovereign powers over that of the National Government. The South opposed a high protective tariff on the ground that a tariff did not protect the agricultural\ninterests in that section. Slavery had grown up in the South as an institution which was needed for the raising of cotton and tobacco. Webster was in favor of a high protective tariff, and was opposed to the doctrine of States Rights, and Negro slavery.\nThe great compromiser of those days was Henry Clay, one of the ablest lawyers and statesmen of that day. He was the chief supporter of the Missouri Compromise. This was in 1819, when a long and bitter struggle took place between the proslavery and anti-slavery parties over the admission of Missouri into the Union. Clay was the author of the Compromise which admitted Missouri on a slavery basis. His greatest compromise measure was that of 1850, which no doubt postponed the Civil War for ten years. This compromise grew out of the question as to whether or not California, and other western areas including Utah, should be admitted to the Union as states. Calhoun proposed that they become slave states, while Clay advocated the doctrine of allowing the people to decide for themselves. California was admitted as a free state, and while the Latter-day Saints in Utah asked for statehood under the name of the State of Deseret, it was denied and Congress organized Utah Territory. Brigham Young was made its first governor.\nWEBSTER, Calhoun, and Clay died in the early part of the decade beginning in 1850, and they left the country in unusual ferment. How to describe the social, political, and economic conditions in a few words up to the time of the Civil War would be a difficult thing to do.\nJames Truslow Adams, the eminent American historian has written:\nDuring the decade between 1850 and 1860, the American people had been forced by circumstances to meet great political differences. The South had suddenly, due to the inventions of the North and of England, found itself one of the richest and most important economic sections of the earth. Its prosperity depended on its slave-grown cotton. Yet the world had increasingly demanded that the South should rid itself of slavery, though it could offer no suggestion as to how to do so. The South was forced into a position of defence, which meant expansion, and this forced the South more and more out of the main currents of the modern world. Men knew that a crisis would come some day that would threaten the very life of the Nation.\nWith the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, that crisis came. With the secession of the Southern States in 1860-61, the great Civil War was precipitated, the results of which left the South in a ruined condition. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued his formal proclamation. That the slaves in the states that were in rebellion should be free. This was a terrific blow to the economic, social, and political life of the South.\nTo understand Lincoln's feelings during the Civil War it is best to read his First Inaugural Address, given March 4, 1861, and his Second Inaugural which was even more striking in its sustained emotion: \"... Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray...\" \"With malice toward none....\" The soul of Lincoln was in what he said. One thing which made Lincoln a great statesman was the fact that he learned how to speak the truth. He loved truth more than he loved position or anything else in\n517\nthe world. His power over men lay in his profound sincerity. When the war was over, his reconstruction policy was foreshadowed in his own words: \"If we are wise and discreet, we shall reanimate the states and get their governments in successful operation.... I hope there will be no persecution, no bloody work after the war is over.\" His larger ideals of Americanism are seen in his Gettysburg address, delivered November 19, 1863. (See American Citizens Handbook, p. 245.)\nFrom the death of Lincoln to World War I, America grew in wealth and influence among the nations of the world. A new age was born. Millions of foreigners came to our shores, becoming good American citizens. America has been developing the lofty ideals of its founders, for the people are naturally religious and have, as Frederick Harrison says, \"kept alive the zeal for learning, justice, and humanity.\" No nation of all history has developed the institutions of civilization as has America; no other nation has held more sacred the democratic institutions and the faith and belief in the Christian religion.\nSince Lincoln's day, America has had great and wise statesmen, all of whom have played their parts in preserving our Government with its high ideals. They have added to its renown; they have been men who have stood for the sacredness of the Constitution and the highest principles of government. In closing, we name three of the statesmen of these years: Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson.\n518\nQuestions and Suggestions for Study or Reports\nIn discussing this lesson on the statesmen, you may not agree with the author in his selection of the great statesmen of our country. Every American has his own favorites, and his opinion is respected, as he in turn respects the opinions of others. This right of preference is part of our American rights.\n1.

One such character was Lehi. The history of a great nation was dependent upon his willingness to obey the will of God.\nHe first appears upon the Book of Mormon scene as a righteous man who lived 600 years before the birth of the Savior, in the city of Jerusalem. This great city, this royal city, was ruled then by King Zedekiah whose kingdom was that of Judah. In name, Jerusalem was holy, for there had been built the Temple of the Lord. \"Its busy streets were crowded with a mixed multitude. Priests and Levites who officiated in the ordinances of the law of Moses, worshipers from the other tribes of Jacob, warriors of the armies of Judah, courtiers and attendants on the king, the merchants from Egypt, from Tyre and Sidon and from many other parts, artificers in various trades, all these combined to make it wealthy and renowned, a busy mart of trade, a center of civilization....\" (Story of the Book of Mormon, pp. 20-22, by George Reynolds.)\nLehi, his heart not being set upon the riches of the world, looked with\nunconcern upon the great treasures and fine adornments which had been brought to beautify the homes and great public buildings of this chief city in all Israel. People, he could see, because of their riches had forgotten the Lord. The prophets who came to warn were persecuted and sent away. Riotous living was sought after, and care or concern for the commandments of God brushed aside.\nKnowing the wrath of God, Lehi yearned to know His will as to the fate of this people. He was told that Jerusalem would be destroyed because of the iniquity of her inhabitants, and that many of her people would be carried off into captivity. Further did the Lord instruct him, that he too should go and warn the city of the disasters that would shortly come unless the people would repent. This Lehi did, only to meet with the same persecution as did other prophets before him. But because of Lehi's faithfulness the Lord spoke unto him in a dream saying: \"Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.\" \"And it came to pass,\" continues Lehi's son Nephi, \"that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his famiy and depart into the wilderness. And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him. And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, 519 and took nothing with him save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness.\" (I Nephi 2:2-4) Lehi's belief in the word of God was not a passive one. He put into practice the counsels of the Lord by showing a willingness to forsake all earthly things for the greater values of the spirit. With but enough provisions to sustain 'life, he took his family and traveled to the borders of the Red Sea. (Reynolds) In company with him was his wife Sariah, and also his sons Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. Other children are mentioned later, some of whom were born in the wilderness. Nephi, by nature a sweet and willing boy in following his father's wishes, soon found favor in the sight of God. Not long after finding a home in the wilderness for his family, Lehi again had a dream which he revealed to his son Nephi, saying: \"Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem. For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of thy forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass. Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness. And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I] have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord. Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast not murmured.\" (I Nephi 3: 2-6)\n520\nIt is mainly through the faithfulness and obedience of Nephi that the record of the Jews was obtained from Laban, which made it possible for Lehi and his family to have the word of God, for which, writes Nephi, did his father thank the God of Israel. Lehi knew that with God's word the nation to follow him should not dwindle and perish in unbelief. (I Nephi 4:13)\nFor purposes of this lesson which deals with the character of Lehi, it is necessary to omit many interesting details that happened to this man, his family, and Ishmael's family, as they traveled through the wilderness and over the ocean to the land of promise, a land choice above all other landsthe Americas. The highlights of this journey include the struggles that Lehi and his younger son Nephi had in keeping the spirit of humility present in the hearts of Laman and Lemuel. These sons found it difficult not to harden their hearts against God. It was mainly because of the rebellious acts of these brothers that the traveling, the building of a ship, the voyage across the great waters, and the need for cooperative living in the land of promise were made more difficult for Lehi. Much time and energy was lost in the corrections and rebukes which he frequently was called upon to administer to these two wayward sons.\nYet it was in these strivings toward the right that Lehi's character and steadfast faith took root and developed. His was a faith that resulted in worksa willingness of spirit that showed his belief in God through service. It was in this service that many of the plain and precious truths of the Gospel were explained in the\nwords of counsel which he gave his family. Because of the sweetness of his spirit, and because of the deep parental love he had for his own, he poured out his soul in words of earnest hope, relating again and again the dreams he had known through the grace of the Lord. No finer sermon has ever been preached than that to be found in I Nephi, chapter 8, entitled, \"The dream of the tree, the river, and the rod of iron.\"\nAnswers to questions such as these which follow are made plain by Lehi's words describing his dream: Why are many people quick to see that faith, repentance, and baptism are the steps one takes to become a member of Christ's church, and yet why do so many fail to act upon their beliefs? Why are the great multitudes of men and women unable to understand the will of God?\nAfter a brief class discussion of these questions have I Nephi, chapter 8, read. For further interpretation of Lehi's dream read also I Nephi 15:25-36.\nQuestions for Active Reading and Discussion\nWith the help of other suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the passage given to discover plain and precious truths of the Gospel brought to light in the Book of Mormon. If time permits, have each member of the class add a passage of his own selection from within that part of the Book of Mormon (I Nephi, and II Nephi, chapters 1 to 4) that tells of the life and words of Lehia passage that has brought new meaning to a Gospel truth.\n1. Lehi and his seed were promised the land of America for their inheritance. He and his family worked hard to\nrealize this promise. America has ever demanded sacrifice from those who would seek its shores. Why? Read II Nephi 1:1-11.\nThe next question may be used if needed\n521\nfor class activity, or it may be assigned for home study.\n2. Why has God permitted joy and misery, and good and sin to be in this world? Read Lehi's explanation of \"opposition in all things\" to his son Jacob.

When the children are asleep, we let the fire go out.

Robin has never been very strong.\"\nSuddenly Lois felt dazed and weak. She wondered if she would be able to stand. Her one desire was to get up and rush out. At last she said in a meek, low tone, \"I see. Don't worry about it.\" She got to her feet. \"It doesn't matter if he is late. I'm sorry I made him feel bad today.\" She stopped because she could not keep her voice steady.\nMrs. Marshall got up too. She said, \"Robin is so happy in school. He loves you. He tells me all about your pretty clothes, even the color of your handkerchiefs. John and I sometimes tease him by calling you 'The Princess.'\" Then she looked a little embarrassed. \"Only in fun, you know. We think the public school is the greatest thing in the world. It gives our child everything.\"\n\"No,\" Lois said, shaking her head. \"No,\" more firmly, \"It couldn't give him his sweet smile. You are the one who gave him that. And the schools couldn't do much either without homes like yours to back them up. It's people like you that have made America great.\"\nShe took hold of the doorknob, then turned back to Mrs. Marshall. Touching the baby's cheek lightly with her finger, she looked up suddenly into the mother's eyes, her own swimming. \"And I think you have everything too,\" she said. \"Everything a woman wants most.\"\nHastily she went out, closing the door softly. \"Oh, God!\" she prayed. \"Make me worthy to be their Princess.\"\n\nShort-story Article to Appear in September Issue\nThe concluding article on short-story writing by Pearl Spencer which was scheduled to appear in the August issue of Thesee announcement June-July Magazine, page 394) will appear in the September issue of the Magazine.\n\nTrain Up A Child in the Way He Should Go (Continued from page 473)\nthorities, the absence of card playing, and the paying of an honest tithing, picturing the blessings which may be inherited through marriage in a temple for time and all eternity, and demonstrating the joy of having a family. Attending Church meetings together, singing songs together, playing wholesome games together, and reading the scriptures together, will also help to mold an entire family into a righteous pattern.\nPerhaps one of the greatest causes for concern on the part of the mother in this day is the proper guarding of her daughter at nighttime. Teenage girls should always be properly supervised when outside the home in the late evening and night, whether they are returning from Mutual or a party. How few of our present delinquency problems would exist if young girls were kept close to the family circle and more attractive recreation were offered them within the home. This is a parental responsibility which mothers, more than fathers, should undertake to provide.\nAs mothers of Zion, let us awaken to the responsibilities resting upon us today. Remember the admonition of Solomon, the wisest man of his time, \"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\" No joy in the world is comparable to that experienced by parents whose children love the Lord and manifest it by living in accordance with the law of the Lord. No care, no solicitude, no attention, and no sacrifice that a mother makes in order to train up her child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord will ever be wasted. The riches of eternity are for such as these.M. C.

Some minutes after the tardy bell had rung, Robin Marshall hurried in and slipped into his seat. \"Late again,\" Lois announced. \"This will never do, Robin. You bring down our record.\" Robin hung his head. \"He's always clean, at least,\" Lois thought as she noticed his nicely ironed blue coveralls with the folded handkerchief peeping from the breast pocket, and his blond curls brushed smooth. She couldn't say as much for most of her pupils. There was no excuse for letting children come to school dirty with their shoes untied and their hair not combed. She could hardly bear to look at some of them and nothing could have induced her to touch them. \"Readerspage 6,\" she commanded. Then began the monotonous repetition, \"I see the dog. The dog can run. I see the cat. The cat can jump.\" \"Next, Robin.\" When he did not begin, Lois looked at him in surprise. He never lost the place and he was a good reader. \"Robin,\" she repeated. \"The cat,\" he began, \"c can \" She looked more closely. Big tears were falling on his book. \"Carl,\" she said out loud, but she? Thought, \"The big baby. Oh, why did I ever accept this job? I don't know anything about children of this age. Why didn't they put me in high school where I belong?\" Lois got through the day somehow. Everything seemed to go wrong. Again and again Robin failed to recite. \"The child must be sick,\" she thought. Usually he was all enthusiasm and smiles. When she came back from escorting the children to the door that afternoon, Lois sat down wearily, her head in her hands. This school had the reputation of being the least desirable school in town and it seemed to Lois that it was living up to its reputation. Miss Thomas, the second grade teacher, a woman past thirty-five, came in to borrow some colored chalk. \"How do you stand it?\" Lois stormed. \"You've been here ten years.\" \"Oh, it's a job,\" Miss Thomas answered listlessly. \"Not much is expected here.\" She helped herself from the box on the desk. \"Well, I don't intend to waste my life on such children,\" Lois went on, \"Tl make such a record that the supervisor will notice and transfer me.\" She took up some pictures she had brought that morning and began to tack them to the wall. One was of a rosy-cheeked boy sliding downhill on his sled. His happy smile made her think of Robin again. What was the matter with the child, anyway? He was the one Page 479 480 bright spot in her day, usually, but lately he had failed her. If she was going to make a record, she had better begin with him. Lois put on her new squirrel coat and pulled her scarlet tam over her dark curls. Going back to the desk, she turned through her roll book and found Robin's address318 Sherman Streetnot too far to walk. She would go and have a talk with his mother.: Lois walked rapidly, for the wind was cold. As she approached the railroad tracks, she noticed that the snow got dirtier and dirtier and scraps of paper blew about. A shrill whistle sounded, and gates appeared from nowhere across her path. A long freight train moved by. Could a train have delayed Robin, she wondered? She must remember to caution the children. She had better not urge them to hurry. By the time the street was clear again, Lois was cold. She walked rapidly and soon found the number she sought. The porch was covered with muddy dog tracks. An old woman opened the door a few inches. \"Im looking for Mrs. Marshall,\" Lois explained. \"She lives at the back,\" the woman snapped, and closed the door. Lois went round the house. The snow had been cleared away but there was no pavement. Seeing a door at the side, she knocked. The door was opened by a young woman scarcely older than Lois. She smiled and Lois said confidently, \"You are Robin's mother.\" \"And you are his teacher.\" The woman stepped back courteously. \"He has told me about your lovely coat. Come inwon't you?\" Lois stepped in and was immediately sorry she had not taken off her galoshes for the bare floor was spotless. Mrs. Marshall drew a plain wooden rocker towards the range. \"Sit here,\" she said, \"you must be cold.\" Lois noticed that the room, though small, served as kitchen, dining room and living room. 'There was very little furniture. Some clothes hung on a line over the stove. '\"Won't you take off your coat?\" Mrs. Marshall asked as she put a shovel of coal on the fire. \"No,\" Lois answered. \"I can't stay. I just came to ask why Robin has been tardy so often lately.\" Just then a wail came from the clothesbasket on the table. Mrs. Marshall took out a tiny baby and held it to her shoulder. Then she began. \"Wellyou see. I'm very sorry. It's my fault, I supposenot manag-. Ing.\" She stopped and fussed with the baby's blanket. \"It must be hard to get small children up in the morning,\" Lois offered. \"Oh, that isn't it.\" Again a pause followed. \"It's just that it's so hard to dry his coveralls.\" I don't understand,\" Lois said. \"Well, you see, I can't wash them till he goes to bed. It was all right when I could hang them out but now they don't get dry.\" The baby cried again so the young mother walked back and forth. Lois waited because she did not know what to say. Hesitatingly Mrs. Marshall continued, \"We've been short of coal (Continued on page 521) Can Your Stake Increase Magazine Subscriptions?"

            "content": "Train Up a Child In the Way He Should Go  the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.\" Thus did the Lord speak to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829. In view of this general declaration, how great a responsibility rests upon parents who take upon themselves the sacred obligation of bringing certain spirits into this world through their lineage, clothing them with temporal bodies, and passing on to those spirits much of their physical and mental characteristics. What a strict accounting will be required of parents as to the manner in which they guarded and protected, trained up and set in the path of righteousness those immortal souls specifically entrusted to their care! There is no duty more obligatory upon this earth than the duty resting upon parents to rear their children properly. When parents are called upon to account for the manner in which they have trained their children, what excuse will be accepted for laxness or neglect in the training? Will any mother be able to point to any other service she may have performed as being more vital and important than the proper rearing of her children? In accepting any type of employment, the prime concern of a mother should be the question as to whether or not her children will be properly and adequately cared for during her absence. ) What are some of the activities of a Latter-day Saint family which serve as loops of steel to bind the family together and strengthen it to live, as a unit, a righteous life? One of the strongest bonds. Certainly, is family prayer, the uniting of a family. In a spiritual oneness. Seldom is a family drawn more closely together than at such times. Any righteous activity or observance of a law of the Lord entered into by an entire family will guide that family along the straight path. Among such activities may be mentioned the proper observance of the Sabbath, the keeping of the Word of Wisdom, refraining from any criticism of Church au- (Continued on page 522) Tomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd CHAPTER V Synopsis: Janet, projectingly reared in Washington, D. C., lives in constant dread of the San Juan country of Utah where her husband, Paul Morgan, has an Indian trading post on the mesa. She plans on their moving to Washington before the birth of her baby, but does not disclose this intention to her husband. Upon returning home with Paul after a happy week spent on the mesa, they find that Janet's sister, Rhae, and her husband, Warren Newsbaum, have arrived for a short visit with the announced intention of taking Janet back to Washington with them. The next morning Paul is hurt when he saves Warren from being dragged by a broncho. A few months later, while Paul, restored to health, is absent on a roundup, an Indian, Mike, threatens to kill Janet. She seeks refuge in the Devil's Corridor where she becomes unconscious. HE minute Dr. Potsworth's old Ford rattled into the yard at El Toro he was out of it, his short legs pushing through the sand and up the flagstone path to the house. He panted to a stop as Paul threw open the door, flung his hat aside and grumbled nervously: \"Can't a respectable doctor turn his back on a patient but there's mischief to pay? Janet was laughing and well only a few hours ago!\" \"You saw her? You were here?\" \"Of course. I come as often as the weather and roads will let me. Why, the place looks like the leavings of a tornado! What's been going on here?\" \"IT wish I knew,\" Paul gritted. \"Hurry, doctor, please!\" \"What a mess.\" Dr. Potsworth examined the room professionally. Page 474 \"Quite an operation. An amputation or two; a few broken joints\" \"Never mind the room,\" Paul begged. \"Janet's in here, Doc. Hurty!\" He threw open the bedroom door. \"I found her unconscious in the Devil's Corridor.\" \"Hurt?\" \"T can't tell. Something pretty bad must have happened. I came home to find Taos knifed in the throat, Juanee gone, and the place smashed to bits.\" One look at Janet, lying inert, beads of perspiration along her hairline, and Dr. Potsworth became absorbed. At the sound of their voices, Janet stirred restlessly. Paul took her hand and began to chafe her fingers gently. \"Will you be able to handle this, Doc? You'll know a specialistIt was all my fault. I\" \"Take it easy, Paul. Of course I can handle it. We'll get help when we need it.\" \"Then do something. Don't just stand there looking at -her!\"' \"There isn't anything to do. Not now. 'Tomorrow, maybe.\" \"I can't stand it till tomorrow. It's all my fault, I tell you; I left her alone. I don't even know what happened!\" - \"Whatever is was, it happened after I left here. Evidently it had something to do with Janet's collapse. But I'm inclined to think this might have happened anyway. Janet's lived with fear too long.\" TOMORROW'S CUP \"Fear. Janet afraid? Doc, you're all wrong. Janet isn't afraid of anything! Why, she stands up to this country like a veteran! 'This was no ordinary fear.\" \"No. It's evident that Janet had cause to hide in the Corridor. But that's not what I mean. You've sold yourself on the idea that this country belonged to the gods before they turned it over to you. Well,, it didn't. It's cold and hard and exacting; only you're too absorbed to see it. Janet's been afraid since the day she came to El Toro to live!\" Paul groaned. '\"\"Then let's get her out of here!\" \"Her only chance lies in rest and quiet. She must not be moved.\" \"But what is it? What causes such things? If it wasn't fear, then what was it?\" | \"We don't know. Such cases are not uncommon, however.\" Dr. Potsworth turned from his long contemplation of Janet and went to the window. \"Why don't you do something?\" Paul implored. \"Take her pulse; do anything except just stand there!\" \"Her pulse is all right. I counted the one in her throat. She's tired; she wants to rest.\" \"And I thought mustangs couldn't break her spirit.\" \"She may sleep this off.\" \"But Janet isn't asleep. Even I can tell that!\" \"No. She isn't asleep, now, but she soon will be. She may sleep for days.\" Potsworth turned from the window. \"Don't worry too much, Paul. I have the feeling that What might happen in this case, won't happen. I'll send for Mark Groneman if it'll make you feel bet- 475 ter. He's the latest authority on this sort of thing.\" Paul noted the break in Potsworth's sentence, and his heart sank. He wanted to ask, \"Authority on what?\" but shrank from the clarity of professional terms. If he could believe that Janet was all right, that she was going to be all right, then he could keep sane, and wait. But did Potsworth know? After all, he was getting on in years \"T'll send the telegram to Groneman,\" Paul said. \"There's no one else to go, and the phone is wrecked.\" Potsworth scribbled the message. Paul looked long at Janet,. Then he turned and went hurriedly out. ~ FE, was back before Potsworth expected him, even in his state of mind. \"Possibly a dead horse on the ranch tonight, as well as a dead dog,\" he reproved. \"'There's no use going off the deep end, Paul. I've told you that, for the present at least, Janet is all right.\" Paul nodded miserably. \"'I'd like a clueThere's something unhealthy in store for someone. I wish Joe would come. And what do you suppose happened to that measly squaw?\"' \"Juanee is probably on her way here now. I fancy her leaving, and the fracas here, originated from the same source. Juanee's faithful as only a squaw can be. I'll warrant she's in trouble, too.\" Janet sighed deeply, but not a muscle of her body moved. \"We're talking too much. Suppose you go out and straighten up a bit; pick up the pieces. I'll hold clinic in here.\" 476 \"You'll stay all night?\" \"Yes. But don't you go stirring up trouble. Janet needs you here.\" Potsworth followed Paul out. \"T'll be here, Doc, but that's no insurance for the Indian that started this.\" Potsworth looked at him shrewdly. \"You've got a posse out?\" \"Within an hour every man in Grayson will be out after the Indians.\" | \"Tt's an Indian, all right. Mike. And possibly that brat of his.\" \"Mike! How do you know?\" \"Mike's blind in one eye, and can't shoot straight. See that bullet hole above your head?\" Paul glanced at the casing of the door against which he leaned. Potsworth indicated a gouge in the wood. \"Tt glanced off. I'll bet every bullet that was fired took the same angle.\" Paul picked up the empty shell. \"That came out of my own gun!\" \"There'll be a straight bullet for Mike, and it won't glance off!\" \"Now, look here, Paul. 'The whole Indian nation isn't responsible for this. I'll hold you accountable if there's a feud stirred up. Those hotheads will grab the first Indian they meet. You've got to stop them. Now get out and fix that telephone wire so we can call off the dogs!\" \"Why didn't I have you do that instead of sending you to town, anyway?\" he grumbled as Paul went. \"For a bright man, I haven't much sense!\" THERE'S the plane!\" Paul raced from the patio toward the desert pasture. \"That's Groneman, all right!\" \"That's a soft landing field.\" \"He'll make it! Things too regular!\" \"That's a perfect landing if I ever saw one!\" Paul cried. \"Look at the cowboys scatter; they expected the plane to bounce all over the country and end up in a bed of prickly pears.\" Paul was already halfway to the pasture; Dr. Potsworth hurried after him as fast as his shorter legs would take him, puffing and wheezing like his old car in a sand rut. Fifteen minutes later the two doctors were in Janet's room, holding a consultation. \"Why did you send for me, Potsworth? You had this catalogued.\" Dr. Groneman had been watching Janet intently for several minutes. Exactly the same expression was on his face that Potsworth's had worn when he first saw her. \"Tm gettin' old and seedy, Mark. Been out here so long I can't tell mumps from whooping cough.\" \"You're as good an authority as we have on this sort of thing, Potsworth, I may as well go back, for any good I'll be. But I'd like to stick around and watch you work. How could anybody get nerve exhaustion in a place like this? It's the top of the world!\" \"Let's turn the patient over to your nurse and take a little of it in,\" Potsworth said. \"I've been glued to this spot for-two days. I'm mighty thankful to have a nurse on the scene. Even our Indian woman was - gone when I got here.\" There followed days of waiting. Paul worked tirelessly at insignifcant things, saying little. Janet roused occasionally to a state that bordered consciousness, but most of the time she slept a detached, He doesn't like TOMORROW'S CUP feather-like sleep. 'The household lived on tiptoe. On the fifth morning, Paul followed Dr. Potsworth into the yard. Dawn was breaking, rose-hued over the desert. Wind brushed against his face with sympathetic coolness. Paul neither saw nor heard. \"I can't stand this any longer, Doc,\" he said. \"I thought I'd feel better if I didn't know the worst, but I don't. Nothing could be worse than the things I conjure up. What is it both you and Groneman imply, yet do not say, even between yourselves? What is it you fear?\" \"Paralysis.\" The word cut the air like hawk wings. Paul felt the pressure of blood in every vein of his body. Potsworth took his arm and they went back to the house. At the door Paul said doggedly: \"If we could get her to a hospital\" \"We've discussed that endlessly, Groneman and J. We both agree that her chance is still in perfect quiet. If labor will hold off a few more days, the odds will be on her side. The shock of childbirth now 'might be too much.\" \"And the. Baby?\" Paul asked it, dreading the answer. \"Several days overdue. That's the chance we have to take. Nature's pretty sensible, we can but help her out.\" \" Paul pressed the doctor's hand and went slowly toward the store. \"It's awfulthis waitingthis uselessness,\" he muttered. '\"My fingers itch to clutch the hair of a redskin, any one of them, just so I'll feel like a man again!\" But he'd given Doc his word not to go gunning for Mike, and he'd keep it. To the disgust of 477 the cowboys, he'd called off the posse. Only Indian Joe was left to dog Mike's trail. And Joe would do it. If only Juanee would talk! But until Joe came back she would not do that. She had been to her father's hogan and found them gone, hide and baggage, that's all Juanee would say. She cried silently by day and chanted from her hogan by night. Paul awoke to a gray day. By noon a storm broke over the desert. 'Trees turned somersaults. Rocks shivered and broke loose from the cliffs as thunder rocked the clouds into a downpour of rain. Burnteyed, Paul watched it come; watched Janet, too. Groneman stood looking out of the window. \"Will this be a shock?\" he asked Dr. Potsworth, indicating Janet. \"On the contrary. 'This is something she can understand. She's heard the roar of surf against rocks; rain dripping from the roof; rivers on the rampage. This will be home to Janet.\" \"There's never been a rain like this since Janet came here,\" Paul said. \"II hope you're right.\" At the height of the storm Janet's baby came, living barely an hour, then Janet fell into a restful, natural sleep. \"She'll be all right now, Paul,\" Groneman said. \"She'll remember little of this.\" Grief overshadowed Paul's eyes. \"Thenthen Janet will never sense her lossnor know the glory of motherhood?\" Potsworth sighed. \"She may or may not have another child.\" 478 Paul dug the tiny grave on a knoll overlooking El Toro, where it would catch the first and last rays of every sun. Alone, he carried the tiny casket to the little cemetery he had made. Janet knew that in the dim hours of the dawn she had held her baby in her arms; then they had taken it away.... When she was able to go out into the living room again it was May. The spring was full of golden days, the desert sweet with them. (To be continued) << Food Preservation (Continued from page 470) Many homes have good storage facilities. A cool, ventilated cellar under the house offers good conditions for storage of vegetables. Cellars with heating furnaces are usually too warm and dry, but often a room may be partitioned off where the temperature may be controlled by outside windows. Natural earth makes a better floor than concrete or brick because a certain amount of moisture is necessary. Outdoor storage cellars or caves are excellent for storing vegetables. Many farms have this type of cellar. It is built partly underground and offers protection from freezing, and keeps vegetables and apples in excellent condition. Write to the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Farmer's Bulletin No. 879, for the construction details of many types of cellars. We found a very simple method of storage quite satisfactory last year for keeping our Victory Garden products. Carrots, beets, turnips, and onions were put in boxes and bushel baskets, a lid placed over these containers, and holes dug in the garden soil to a little below the depth of each container, then leaves and a very small amount of soil were heaped over the containers. When we needed the products the leaves were removed, but replaced again after getting the desired amount. 'These vegetables kept very well until they were all used, sometime in January. This was a very simple method for the small amount of excess vegetables we had grown during the summer. Bibliography Stark, A.

            "content": "Ideals and Responsibilities\nElder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union\nTHE perpetuation of the race is a major social purpose of the family. This is universally recognized by thinking people everywhere. The Latter-day Saints accept this but in a much more impressive and far-reaching way than do any other people; this because of their belief in the eternity of the family relationship and the eternal progress of man.\nSexual purity, while long and widely recognized as an ideal, and even among some primitive tribes enforced by severe penalties for its violation, receives a new and much more sacred sanction in the teachings of the Latter-day Saints. Parents are, of course, strictly bound, themselves, to practice chastity in the proper meaning of that term. With this as a foundation, they are religiously obligated to develop in their children the highest ideals of family life and sex relations. This calls for understanding not only of the nature of children and youths in general, but also for careful study of the nature of each child for whose moral and religious education the parents are primarily responsible. This responsibility cannot be shifted to any other agency. The Church and the school should, of course, supplement the educational efforts of the family, and the civic community should do its best to build favorable and eliminate unfavorable influences for the proper moral development of children and youths. It is a great mistake, however, to assume that they, individually or collectively, can relieve the family of its responsibility. One of the tragedies of the war situation is that some mothers, either for what they conceive to be patriotic reasons or for The CoverLake McDonald, Glacier National Park. Photo by Hileman. Page 461 462 financial gain, will leave their children without proper guardianship while they are employed outside the home. A mother's duty to her children is her first duty also to her country. One of the greatest dangers to our country, viewed through the generations, is the character demoralization of her future citizens. Without strength, purity, and integrity of character on the part of citizens generally, there can be no national security or achievement worth saving. ' 'In the training of children, emphasis should always be on the positive side. Wholesome pleasures and stimulation of ambition for service and high achievement may be supplemented at opportune times and circumstances by warnings against temptations to take a downward course, but even this may be done with youth in such a way as to lead them to picture in imagination the dire consequence of evil practices. When a youth pictures vividly to himself the consequence of indulging his appetites or passions contrary to the teachings of the Church, it will have far more weight with him than will mere dogmatic teaching or parental commands, although under some circumstances this method may be necessary, especially with children. Even they, however, are generally more able to think and to understand more than most adults give them credit for. 'They should be given a chance to think and to make some decisions for themselves. Parents should, of course, see that the children are led to revise wrong decisions and never to act upon judgments that may be morally or religiously detrimental either to themselves or to others. Arbitrary commands on the part of parents sometimes have the reverse effect of that anticipated. This may be true of attendance at religious gatherings. Sometimes, attempts to force youth in these matters may lead to deception or rebellion and sometimes to hatred of the obligations that parents attempt to force upon them. Even when, out of respect for parents, they yield to the parental admonition, they sometimes cease the activity as soon as parental authority is outgrown. A teacher in Ancient Greece is credited with saying that it was his business to teach boys to love the right. 'That is a primary obligation of parents toward their children. Until they acquire a love of the right and the habit of acting upon that love as a motive, their characters will be imperfectly formed."

            "content": "President Rudger Clawson Elder George Albert Smith President of the Council of the Twelve HE following quotation is taken from Some Impressions of My Father by Samuel G. Clawson, son of President Rudger Clawson: \"Life left no residue of bitterness in him; impression and memories left no scar. He never indulged in selfpity; never tolerated self-esteem. There was no elation when he won. He either won and turned victory into wisdom for the next encounter, else he endured and waited. He never lost because he saw time as part of endless eternity.\" Brother Clawson, who passed away Monday, June 21, 1943, presided over the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for eighteen years and has been a member of the Council for forty-five years. I have been privileged to be intimately associated with him for forty years. To know him was to love him. His kindly, gentle ways have endeared him to all who knew him. His quiet, thoughtful mien gave his co-workers confidence in him, his judgment, and purposes. He was a friend to everyone. His kindliness made him the confidant of the heartbroken and weary. He visited and cheered the sick, inspired and gave hope to the discouraged. Undeviating loyalty to the Presidency of the Church was an outstanding characteristic of the life of President Rudger Clawson. He was a consistent and industrious, hard-working executive. He presided with dignity over the Council of the Twelve Apostles making the stake and mission visiting appointmnts both for this. Quorum, the PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON First Council of Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. He was careful and considerate in his budgeting of assignments, endeavoring to divide the burdens equally. He took his full share of the work and utilized every ounce of his energy to take care of the responsibilities placed upon him as long as his strength permitted. All his public utterances were marked with toleration. His discourses were full of substance and deserving of careful study. A proverbial patience, a flawless faith, a fidelity to the truth coupled with a devotion to the Church and all that it stands for, have made achievements possible which will remain eternally to the credit of Rudger Clawson.

            "content": "Pioneer Homemaker Julia A. Caine A NEW world was opened in 1803 to the expanding Americans who were pushing beyond the western hills. All life seemed to revolve around new ideas and dreams of homes to the west of the broad Mississippi. Word of the great purchase was carried into the isolated hamlets of New Hampshire by postrider, and here men gathered on street corners and talked of moving to the new country, Louisiana, the land beyond the Mississippi. While excitement was at its height in the town of Hillsborough, New Hampshire, a baby girl was born who was to traverse that great territory far into the west and was to establish the first home in the Great Basin. The tiny baby, Harriet Page Wheeler, cared little for her father's talk of the great Napoleon, Indians, and Lewis and Clarke, but these ideas were everyday conversation in the little home, and the West held a promise of adventure as she grew up in New England. Her own home was the typical frontier house of the small settlements where the family was taught to do all things needed for its comfort. She learned to weave her own clothes, trim her own hats, and cook for the family. At the age of sixteen, she was ready for a real adventure in the fabulous West. School teachers were scarce in those days, and a seventeen-year-old gitl who could teach reading, writing, and arithmetic might easily get a position in the familiar little schoolhouse. Harriet packed her Page 464 Caine trunk and set forth for western New York where friends had secured her the job of schoolmarm at Phelps. The young teacher had a school attended by children of all ages. She was very dignified as she listened to the primer class sing their alphabet and as she helped the older students with their fractions. Indian stories in the old readers were her special delight and she must have dreamed often of a land even farther west then frontier New York. The schoolmarm boarded around in the village, went sleigh riding, and made friends with everyone. One of the town's young men soon became her constant companion and eventually, upon becoming the wife of Isaac Decker, Phelps became her home. But America was moving west, and any move to a new frontier held out golden promise. The Deckers joined this moving throng, and finally came to settle in the Ohio country where land was cheap. At New Portage, their home was the typical frontier dwelling. Each morning the family was up at 5 o'clock and breakfast was eaten by lamp light. The boys aided their father in the barnyard, the girls helped with the household tasks, and soon learned to weave, bake bread, and sew. The browneyed Harriet was building her frontier home as her people before her had builded in New England. \"TRAVELERS were few in this land of little hamlets, and the family welcomed a preacher who A PIONEER HOMEMAKER talked of wonderful things that had happened in New York State. How the tired housewife must have enjoyed hearing 'of rivers and hills so near to her old home in Phelps. The wandering preacher was asked to return and the family began to read the books he discussed. They had attended many revival meetings in the past, but this man talked of a new religion that followed the old teaching of the Biblea religion of joy and promise. Here happiness was the keynote. He spoke of a gathering of his people to the West. Soon the Decker family gathered their belongings, joined the Latterday Saint Church, and moved west to Franklin, Ohio, near Kirtland, the home of many Latter-day Saint people. They joined wholeheartedly with their new companions, and, when the Church was in need of funds, the father of this little family gave his entire savings to help his people. Like all Latter-day Saint families, this family was looked upon with distrust by non-Mormon neighbors, who soon began to avoid them. What courage it must have taken to join with other Latter-day Saints and leave for the far Missouri! The turbulent Westerners in Missouri hated the quiet industry of this people who built towns so quickly on the best river lands. Many of the early settlers had come to the frontier either to procure large slave holdings or because they did not fit into the orderly society of the East. Mormon homes grew too rapidly into settlements. Frontier Missouri finally succeeded in driving the Mormons out. So back across Missouri moved the 465 tired little band, and in 1841 they settled on land at a bend of the Mississippi River, later to be known as Nauvoo the Beautiful. Here the well-built houses and shaded streets brought memories of New England. The Decker family now hoped that they had found a permanent home. Yet, even now, the little dwelling was not secure. Isaac Decker had tired of the continual moving and no longer felt enthusiastic for the society that shut him apart from other companions, and so he and his wife, whose whole soul was dominated by religious fervor, parted. Later, she married Lorenzo D. Young and made a pleasant home on the bank of the Mississippi. When the terrible months of persecution came and the Prophet-leader was killed, mobs threatened the beautiful Nauvoo, and Harriet was one of the first to make preparations to move to the West. HE broad Mississippi was frozen as the wagons waited in front of the little home on that cold February day in 1846. The children climbed inside; Lorenzo Young helped his wife into the wagon, and they turned toward the river. Across the ice and on to the Missouri moved the people, trusting in their leaders, who were men of God, to lead them to a new home. When the early spring of 1847 came, Winter Quarters, the temporary resting place of the Saints, was a bustle of activity. Songs of the West rang out and there was talk of California. There was. Also talk of missions to the Indians and how even now the elders of the Church were preaching to the Lamanites. 466 Definite plans were made for a small company to go farther west and to find a home for the people. Harriet's husband was chosen a member of this party. Harriet, suffering from maleria, begged to be taken with them. Brigham Young yielded to Lorenzo and Harriet's desire and agreed to let her go. Two other women also went with this band of scouts over the mountains to find a refuge and a home. 'They were Clara Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young and daughter of Harriet, and Ellen S. Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball. Two children accompanied Harriet. On April 7, the heavily loaded wagons started the long trek west. Seeds, plows, chickens, pigs, and cows made the caravan a picturesque sight. Each night the wagons formed a circle with interlocking wheels into which the cattle were driven. Each evening the women cooked over the campfire. Songs were sung around the fires which awakened echoes on the Platte River that had previously known only the whoop of Indian braves or the more riotous songs of the fortune seeker. Each morning this band of pioneers was up at five o'clock and by seven the train was moving on toward the Rockies. Rafts were built to ford the streams as the band pushed west. In late July the pioneers crossed the South Pass where eleven years earlier Narcissa Whitman had kneeled in thanksgiving for the right to carry the white man's Book to the Indians; but the path of these pioneers lay to the south. The Oregon had become the destination for too many traders and homeseekers. Soon the wagons crossed the rug ged Uintahs and wound down nartow Echo Canyon, where boulders and brush made it hard going for the wagons. The men had to cut a trail; rocks had to be moved. When the turn was made into East Canyon, the way seemed almost impassable. 'The canyon itself was steep; wolves lurked in the underbrush, and rattlesnakes lay in wait for the unwary. The crooked stream was willow-fringed, and rocks made the frequent crossings very slow and precarious. Everywhere huge peaks towered, and the July sun beat upon the toiling men as they tried to clear a way. At last Big Mountain was reached, and from its summit they glimpsed a broad valley which lay over yet another mountain. This must be the place Bridger had told of! This was the valley Goodyear had described. They hoped it was better than the traders had pictured. Now the little band rallied its strength, and by midday, Brigham Young and his brother Lorenzo and their wives were on the benchland east of the Great Salt Lake Valley. The broad stretches of treeless country shimmered in the heat. The women looked over their new home; a lizard ran across the foot of Harriet. She was tired. No house, grass or trees rested her weary eyes. She heard Brigham Young say, \"This is the place,\" and she burst into tears. THE journey had been hard and now this! The sage brush, the sunflowers, nothing looked like home to her as she cried, \"Lorenzo, we have traveled fifteen hundred miles over prairies, deserts, and mountains, but feeble as I am, I would rather journey A PIONEER HOMEMAKER a thousand miles farther than stay in this desolate place.\" But this was to be home. Lorenzo immediately plowed a small tract of land, onto which the water from City Creek was diverted, and he planted the first potatoes in the valley. The day following the entrance into the valley, a strange little assembly gathered, and a little band of worshippers thanked God for their new home. 'They were advised to make a fort for protection, and the next day the work of planting and home building began. At first Harriet's house was in the log and adobe fort, but this was so different from her usual home that she was very unhappy. Her new baby, who had been born in September, fretted in the mud-roofed cabin, and all the houses were so close together that Harriet lacked the privacy she craved. She was a home builder, and stockade life was disagreeable to her. In December, therefore, Lorenzo completed a log cabin of his own outside the fort some distance away. The other members protested at this move because of the danger of Indians, but Harriet thought only of homemaking. Even after an unfriendly Indian did invade her cabin 467 one day, she still refused to leave. It was in January, as she rocked her baby, that the rude savage invaded the little house and demanded \"biscuit.\" Through a ruse, she loosed her watchdog, a powerful mastiff tied in the next room, and took the bow and arrows away from the Indian who had been wounded by the dog. Then, binding up the shoulder of the sullen native, she sent him on his way, and continued her life outside the fort. Spring had hardly arrived before the beauty-loving Harriet was hard at work making her house a home. She had brought the first children into the little settlement. Her son was the first white boy to be born in the Valley. Now she began to plan her home. Lorenzo brought a small locust tree from the mountains, and Harriet planted it in the front of her house. This was the first tree planted in the Valley. Her yard was the present yard of the Bee Hive House. This intrepid woman had dreamed of the great West, but always as a place of homes. She realized that dream as she planted trees and gardens. Men may plan cities, but women build homes. Salt Lake City is a city of homes and trees, and Harriet Wheeler Young was its original homemaker. MY WANTS. Roberta Bates I only want a little house, A lilac tree beside the door. A house with windows clean and bright, And sunlight dancing on the floor To the lilting music of childish laughter; A hearth whereon a kettle sings; Some birds to nest in the lilac tree, And a patch of sky to try their wings. Food Preservation Edna K. Ward HERE are several methods 'of \"preserving\" the home food supply of fresh fruits and vegetables during the summer growing season. 'To know that no fruits nor vegetables have been wasted, and to have an adequate winter supply of these important foods will be a great satisfaction to all homemakers. Latter-day Saint housewives have always been interested in preserving the summer supply of fruits and vegetables for winter use, and have practiced the adage of \"waste not, want not.\" Vegetables and fruits may be preserved by canning, drying, freezing, and storing. It is the purpose of the following discussion to explain briefly the last three methods. DRYING Drying or dehydration of fruits and vegetables means that enough water is removed to stop the growth of molds and other organisms. If done properly, it will also preserve much of the flavor, color, and food value. Dried products occupy less space for storing. Drying Vegetables 1. Select vegetables that have reached the table-use stage. 2. Clean thoroughly, remove all blemishes. 3. Precook or steam. This prevents excessive loss of food value, sets the color, and hastens drying. Steaming is preferable to boiling in water. Any large kettle in which a rack arrangement can be placed to keep the vegetable up out of the water niay be used Page 468 for steaming, provided the kettle has a tightly-fitting lid. Snap Beans Cut in one inch lengths Steam 15 to 20 minutes Dry 4 to 7 hours Peas Steam 10 minutes Dry 3 to 5 hours Corn Split each row of kernels lengthwise before cutting and scrape cob with a knife to get all the milk from the cob. To 4 quarts of corn add: 1 cup cream or rich milk  cup sugar 2 tablespoons salt Mix and boil for 20 minutes stirring constantly to prevent scorching. Spread in shallow pans and dry in the oven or dryer, stirring often. Dry until the kernels will break with clean glass-like fracture. Spinach Leaves or Other Greens Strip out heavy midribs from chard or other large leaves. Steam 1 to 3 minutes Spread on trays covered with cheesecloth, dry 2 to 4 hours in the oven. Oven Drying For most families the oven is large enough to dry all necessary foods. It is convenient and inexpensive. Cover the racks with cheesecloth or other thin material. Set the temperature control at 150. Open the oven door about every hour and change the position of the trays to give uniform drying. The temperature may be increased to 250 and FOOD PRESERVATION the oven door left slightly open all the time if desired. Drying Fruit Practically all commercially dried fruit is treated with sulphur. This is to improve the appearance, keeping qualities, and food values. After sulphuring, the fruits are sun-dried. They should be covered with cheesecloth or screens to prevent flies or insects from contaminating them. Apples Apples are the most commonly dried fruit. 'They are sliced in quarter-inch slices and may or may not be sulphur treated and dried in full sun. Fruit that is sufficiently dried has an elastic springy feel. Most fruits such as cherries, peaches, apricots, and pears are canned for home use. These fruits may also be dried, however. The Utah State Agricultural College Extension Service in Logan will supply detailed methods of sulphur treatment and drying these fruits. Drying Herbs Parsley, mint or sage may be easily dried for winter use. Hang them inside with the leaves down, and when dry, remove the leaves and store them in glass jars. 4 Storing Dried Products Be sure that foods are thoroughly dry. Sun-dried fruits should be heated in the oven at 200 before storing. Store in paper bags, covered jars, or airtight tins. Preparation for the Table Soak overnight or for several hours (about one pound of vegetables per pound of water). Drain the water into a kettle, bring it to a 469 boil, add the dried product and cook until tender. Do not overcook. FREEZING This method of food preservation is comparatively new, and is becoming increasingly popular. The natural fresh flavor, appearance, and food values are satisfactorily maintained. Present research indicates that quick freezing does not destroy vitamins A, thiamin (B:), riboflavin (Bs), or ascorbic acid (C). Vitamin losses increase if the preparation for freezing is delayed. Following are some rules to insure high-quality frozen products: 1. Select high-quality fresh products ready for immediate use. 2. Clean and prepare to preserve natural color, flavor, and food values. 3. Pack or wrap in reasonably airtight containers. 4. Freeze in quick freeze room where temperature is 10 or 15 degrees below zero. 5. Store in lockers where temperature is kept at zero. 6. Keep products frozen until ready for use. 7. Cook products requiring cooking in such a way as to retain the most food values. Freezing Fruits Fruits that freeze satisfactorily include all kinds of berries, cherries, apricots, peaches, figs, plums, and prunes. 1. Select fruits ready for table use. 2. Wash carefully, discard underripe, overripe, or bruised sections. 3. Cut large fruit (apricots, peaches, prunes) in halves or slices. 4. Pack in waxed containers, fruit jars or enameled tins. (Do not use rub- ' ber rings on fruit jars.) 470 5. Use sugar, (1/2 cup to 1 quart of fruit) ot cold syrup (342 cups sugar to 1 quart water).; 6. Keep fruit as cool as possible and get to the locker at once. 7. Freeze at 10 to 15 degrees below zero. 8. Store where temperature is kept at zero with no more than 5 degrees variation. Freezing Vegetables Vegetables that freeze satisfactorily include asparagus, green beans, lima beans, broccoli, chard, corn, peas, spinach, and cauliflower. To Prepare Vegetables for Freezing 1. Select as for table use (get products to locker as quickly as possible; no more than two hours should elapse between time of harvesting and freezing). Z. Clean and wash thoroughly. Cut, shell or slice according to type of vegetable. 3. Scald vegetables in boiling water. Use a wire basket or mosquito netting bag. Be sure water is boiling. Scald small amounts, 5 to 6 pounds. Do not over-scald. Time: Asparagus2-3 minutes Beans (Lima)2-3 minutes Beans (Snap)2-3 minutes Broccoli3-5 minutes Cauliflower2-3 minutes Corn (cut)z2-5 minutes Peas1-1/2 minutes 4. After scalding, place at once under cold running water and leave until the vegetable is as cold as the water. Remove from water as soon as the vegetables are cooled. 5. Place products in waxed containers, fruit jars with rubber-rings or all sealing lids, or enameled cans that are airtight. 6. Pack vegetables dry or in a 2% brine solution. In the brine pack method, vegetables are packed dry in containers, and then 1/ cup of brine is poured over each pint, leaving 2 inch head space in pint containers, and 4 inch in quart containers. Brine Solution 4 teaspoons table-salt dissolved in 1 quart warm water 5 1/3 tablespoons table-salt dissolved in 1 gallon warm water Chill brine before pouring over. Vegetables. (The brine solution should be used as the cooking water when vegetables are used. ) 7. Keep the vegetables as cold as possible until they reach the locker. 8. Quick freeze and store in locker. HOME STORAGE Several vegetables lend themselves to storage better than to any other method of preservation. Carrots, beets, celery, onions, late cabbage, parsnips, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and turnips may be stored as they come from the garden. Cabbage Vitamin C is one of the important food nutrients in cabbage. Raw cabbage is one of the cheapest year-round vitamin C foods. It also contributes calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Cabbage may be stored and used fresh. It may also be made into sauerkraut and packed in jars. Sauerkraut Use fully matured heads. Shred and place in stone jars. Use alternate layers of cabbage and salt in proportion of one pound of salt to forty pounds of cabbage. Pack firmly in stone jar, cover with a clean cloth and a board or plate on which is placed a weight heavy enough to cause the brine to come up to the cover. Keep at about 86 F. For about 10 days to allow it to ferment. Remove skum as it forms. Pack in glass jars and add enough brine to fill jar. (Continued on page 478)"

Cannon ERNARD SHAW has stated that woman's emancipation, with the growth of feminism, has not tended to discourage masculinity in men, but has tended to discourage boorishness, a trait of the weak who are trying to conceal their weakness. \"THERE have always been men who believe that women like to be dominated by the \"stronger sex.\" Ralph A. Habas, in the April issue of Facts, discusses this question thoughtfully in an article, \"Do Women Want Domination?\". He takes the negative viewpoint, and says that an attitude of voluntary cooperation should be the keynote of a happy marriage; neither dominance nor submissiveness, but a deep-seated regard for each other's personality. \"THE magnitude of America's Red Cross movement may be gauged by activities in its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters, reported by Louis Markey in \"Twenty-four Hours a Day,\" (Red Book, April 1943.) Most of the 43,000 workers are women, generally unpaid volunteers. In the Home Service Division, contacts are established, when necessary, between American families and their sons overseas (about 8,000 cases monthly). In the Blood Donors' Division, twenty cots are occupied nearly all the time. Stationary canteens are operated by 2,000 women. 'There are 1,000 nurses' aids, 200 Gray Ladies, 300 staff assistants, 500 stenographers and clerks, and 100 F. B. I. Assistants. In the Public Education Division, 250,000 women have taken courses in first aid, home nursing, nutrition, and diet. The workers deliver 5,500,000 surgical dressings monthly.

He was appointed by the First Presidency of the Church, in September 1919, \"to audit the books of the General Board, examine the methods of accounting employed and to make recommendations regarding the bookkeeping and accounting as conditions might require.\" He thus became special advisor and supervisor of the business and financial affairs of the Board, which duty he faithfully and efficiently performed. This able and experienced accountant consolidated the accounts of the Board; set up a modern system of bookkeeping, and then for years supervised the operation of that system; with painstaking care he reviewed the accounts and regularly examined the receipts and disbursements; guarded the expenditures; and annually audited the books and at all times gave sound financial advice. He thus set up for Relief Society a safe and wise pattern of procedure which has been easy to follow. As a professional bookkeeper and auditor of long experience, President Clawson's contribution to the General Board has a value so great that it can hardly be measured. With painstaking care President Clawson also examined and became familiar with the Relief Society stake and ward record books, and with the Page 472 annual financial, statistical, and narrative reports sent in annually by these organizations to be audited and compiled by the General Secretary for presentation to the General Board and to the women of the whole organization. Few Relief Society women were more familiar with the inner workings of the organization, and no one was more proud of the systematic and painstaking efforts and accomplishments of stake and ward officers and workers in carrying on these practical affairs of the organization than was President Rug Clawson. Hardly a week in the year passed without a visit to Relief Society headquarters by this good and faithful man. Keenly did he sense his responsibility, and greatly interested was he in the affairs of the organization. 'This close association over a period of more than twenty years, together with his kindness, friendliness, courtesy, and good humor endeared him not only to the executive officers, but to every member of the staff. President Clawson was consulted regarding many of the varied problems of the Society as a whole, and his wise and fatherly counsel and advice were always very helpful. President Clawson was a living example of loyalty and devotion to the Church. No sacrifice was too great for him to make for the Gospel of the Master. He was a great defender of the faith. While he had EDITORIAL always a mild-appearing manner, yet for the right he was always aggressive. He always manifested that same courage which he exhibited when, as a young missionary in Georgia, he bravely faced the firing squad of that threatening and infuriated mob which had brutally taken the life of his missionary companion; and as he stood beside the dead 473 body of his associate and listened to the continued threats of the mob, he even bared his breast and told them to shoot. This surprising attitude on his part so startled the mob that they turned away, leaving him alone with the body of his friend and companion in the dense woods of GeorgiaAmy Brown Lyman."

            "content": "General Secretary-Treasurer Vera White Pohlman N 1921, when Thewas in its eighth year, the General Board was faced with the necessity of increasing the subscription price because of higher costs of printing during and after World War I. Relief Society women throughout the Church, eager to maintain the subscription price at one dollar per year, pledged themselves to increase the circulation so that the price need not be raised. They fulfilled this pledge and the price has been maintained at one dollar per year ever since. Furthermore, a steadily increasing circulation has made it possible to offer a bigger and better Magazine during the past few years, still at the dollar rate. Now, in its thirtieth year, the Magazine is again threatened with a higher subscription priceagain because of increased costs due to war conditions. And again the circulation must be greatly increased in order to avoid raising the subscription price. The General Board believes that Relief Society members, officers, and Magazine representatives will give every possible support to the Magazine in order that its present high quality may be maintained without increasing the subscription price, just as did the Relief Society women of nearly a quarter century ago. In order that the various stakes and missions may fully realize their present Magazine subscription rates and the great opportunity for extending the circulation, Magazine subscriptions in relation to Relief Society members are listed in the accompanying table and pictographs for all stakes and English-speaking missions of the Church which submitted the official annual Relief Society report to the General Board. The chart lists all stakes in alphabetical order, followed by the Englishspeaking missions. Opposite the name of each stake and mission is a row of 20 symbolssome dark and some lighteach representing 5 per cent of the Relief Society members in the stake or mission. The dark symbols represent the proportion of members who subscribed for the Magazine in 1942; the light symbols represent the proportion of members who did not subscribe for the Magazine IN 1942. The General Board has never required a specified quota of Magazine subscriptions from the various stakes, wards, and missions, but it has recognized, in the honor roll and by award subscriptions, those Societies whose subscriptions equalled or exceeded 75 per cent of their members. Accordingly, the charts show an achievement line at the 75 per cent point. From this line, stakes and missions may observe the extent to which their 1942 Magazine subscriptions approached or exceeded this point. If every stake and English-speaking Page 48] 482 mission whose subscription rate is less than 75 per cent of the membership will make an effort to increase subscriptions toward this point, it should be possible to keep the Magazine subscription price at one dollar per year. At the end of each row of symbols is a rank number by means of which the corresponding stake or mission may be found in the preceding table, listed in order according to percentage of Magazine subscriptions in relation to members. This table shows, as of 1942, the number of members, number of Magazine subscriptions, and the percentage of subscriptions to members. It also shows the number of subscriptions to be procured during the calendar year 1943 in order for the stake or mission to have a subscription rate equal to 75 per cent of its members, together with the approximate number of Latter-day Saint women in the stake or missionfrom all of whom Magazine subscriptions may be solicited. For example, for the 161 stakes and missions included in the table and chart, a total subscription list of 75,157 would be required to represent 75 per cent of the 100,320 members of Relief Society in these stakes and missions, but there are approximately 165,813 Latter-day Saint women in these same stakes and missions from whom to procure the 75,157 subscriptions. Similar computations may be made in the stakes and missions with respect to their local Relief Societies.\nAttention is especially directed to the annual report in the June-July issue of the Magazine, to the table at the bottom of page 425 showing the extent to which Relief Society officers and class leaders subscribe for the Magazine. This table shows that nearly all (97 per cent) of stake officers and board members subscribe for the Magazine, that nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) of the executive officers in wards and branches are Magazine subscribers, and that 81 per cent of the class leaders take the Magazine. Figures are available in every stake, ward, and mission Relief Society annual report for 1942 from which local rates may be computed.\nAll subscriptions procured by the local Magazine representatives may be included in the count of subscriptions, whether or not the subscribers are members of Relief Society, and also those subscriptions procured within the boundaries of each local ward or branch which are mailed elsewhere, such as gift subscriptions.\nIt should be borne in mind that as the number of members increases or decreases during 1943, the subscription percentage will also fluctuate. For example, if a stake procures the number of subscriptions listed in the table as representing 75 per cent of the members, the subscription rate for this stake at the end of 1943 would be less than 75 per cent if the number of members has increased, or more than 75 per cent if the number of members has decreased. Magazine representatives should therefore check frequently with their Relief Society secretaries to ascertain the current membership count.\nTHE high-ranking stakes and missions which procured Magazine subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of their members for 1942 head the table. These are the Australian and the Western States Missions, and South Los Angeles, San Diego, Big Horn, San Francisco, Union, Cassia, Phoenix, and Bear Lake Stakes. These stakes and missions are also represented in the Notes from the Field of this issue where they tell of methods used in achieving these rates.\nOf the total of 161 stakes and English-speaking missions listed in the table and charts, only these 10 report subscriptions equaling or exceeding 75 per cent of their members. It is especially noteworthy that the Australian Mission and the South Los Angeles Stake each procured subscriptions in excess of their membership. Also worthy of special mention are two districts of the Northern States MissionIllinois North and South with a percentage of 92, and Wisconsin with a percentage of 76, and the South Alabama district of the Southern States Mission with a percentage of 77. Mission districts are not listed separately in the table and chart because not all missions are organized into districts with respect to Relief Society work. These three high-rating mission districts were recognized, however, in the Magazine subscription honor roll in the May issue of the Magazine.\nEach year, local Relief Societies, as well as stakes and missions, whose subscriptions to theequal or exceed 75 per cent of the Relief Society membership, are compiled into an honor roll and published in the Magazine. Each local Magazine representative achieving this goal is awarded a one-year gift subscription to the Magazine. This honor roll is based on the annual Magazine subscription reports submitted by local, stake, and mission Magazine representatives.\nA total of 383 localrepresentatives achieved a place on the honor roll for 1942 and were awarded gift subscriptions, as shown on the honor roll in the Magazine for May 1943, supplemented by the June-July issue, page 412. But these 383 local Relief Societies (284 of them in stakes and 99 in missions), represented only 17 per cent of the total of 2,273 local Relief Societies throughout the Church. Only 8 or 6 per cent of the 144 stakes achieved a rating of 75 per cent, and only 2 of the missions. The missions, however, cannot all be compared in this respect, inasmuch as several of them are in non-English-speaking countries, and reports from some of the English-speaking missions in faraway places could not reach us under wartime shipping conditions.\nMany of the local Relief Societies failed to submit subscription reports to their stake or mission officers, and the General Board received no compiled reports from 99 of the stakes nor from some of the missions from which reports could have reached the office. It is unfortunate that in some of these non-reporting stakes and missions there were local Magazine representatives who had achieved excellent Magazine subscription rates but whose records did not reach the General Board for inclusion in the honor roll either because the local Relief Society failed to submit its report or because the stake or mission failed to send in the compilation.\nThe rates shown are based on members and subscriptions as shown\nCAN YOUR STAKE INCREASE MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS? 483\n484\nin the regular annual report. These figures should have been exactly the same as those submitted on the subscription reports fromrepresentatives, but these figures were in agreement in only about one-fourth of the stakes and missions. In all remaining stakes and missions either the count of members or count of subscriptions was in conflict in the two reports. This is surprising inasmuch as there was only one source of information for each figureMagazine representatives were instructed to procure the count of members as of December 1, 1942 from their respective Relief Society secretaries, and secretaries were instructed to procure the count of subscriptions from their respective Magazine representatives. The regular annual Relief Society report must necessarily be considered as the official report and therefore the figures as printed may not agree in all instances with figures submitted by Magazine representatives, including those printed in the honor roll. It is conceded that in many instances the number of subscriptions as reported by Magazine representatives may have been more accurate than the number shown by the secretary on the annual report, but without evidence to this effect the only alternative is to accept for this purpose the figures in the regular annual report. It is hoped that the recognition of this discrepancy will lead to more accurate reports for 1943.\nDiscrepancies of this sort account for inclusion in the honor roll of two stakes which on the basis of the annual report are not shown in the accompanying table and chart as having achieved a goal of 75 per cent or more.\nTABLE SHOWING, FOR 1942,SUBSCRIPTIONS IN RELATION TO RELIEF SOCIETY MEMBERS In 144 Stakes and 17 English-speaking Missions\nRANK\nSTAKE OR MISSION\nMAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS IN RELATION TO MEMBERS\nSubscriptions to equal 75 Per cent of Members\nEstimated Number of L.D.S.

The following excerpts from the Doctrine and Covenants and from the Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith set forth the position which Latter-day Saints take in regard to the Constitution of the United States:\n\"... It is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.\n\"And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood.\" Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 101:79-80.\n\"Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever.\"Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 109:54.\nThe Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard; it is founded in the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner; it is to all those who are privileged with the sweets of liberty, like the cooling shades and refreshing waters of a great rock in a thirsty and weary land. It is like a great tree under whose branches men from every clime can be shielded from the burning rays of the sun. Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 147.\n\nThe Cover\n\"THE GOLDEN GLOW AND THE COMBINATION FENCE\" T. J. Howells, M. D.\nMANY years ago across the street east from the old Salt Lake Theatre, there was located a small manufacturing company where the western \"combination fence\" was made. This was a lath and wire fence used to enclose the pastures and gardens of early pioneer homes. The industry was started by Bishop Robert T. Burton and the fence, usually red in color made of fir lath, became instantly popular throughout the intermountain country.\nThis month's cover, featuring a picture of a section of this historic fence with golden glow, is characteristic of our intermountain country as are the sagebrush and the mountains. The golden glow is a showy fall blooming flower, widely grown both in the United States and Canada. This old-fashioned ornamental plant reaches a height of between four and seven feet; generous with its bloom, this hardy flower withstands our winters and grows along the fences and the walls and in the gardens of many of our pioneer homes.\nThe photograph is by T. J. Howells, M. D. Cover arrangements are by Evan Jensen.\nVOL. 30, NO. , 1943\n529"

            "content": "To The Parents Of Service Men\nElder Hugh B. Brown Coordinator for L. D. S. Service Men\nIN 1918 the Giant Mars was wounded, and some thought permanently disabled, but by 1939 he had regained his strength and in blind fury is now straining at the pillars of civilization. Never before have so many been called to resist him. Never before have so many parents, wives, brothers, sisters, and friends had a personal interest in great and unpredictable events. Modern efficiency places the most intelligent, the physically sound, the fittest of our youth, in the greatest danger.\nIn 1918, there were less than 20,000 Latter-day Saint men in the service. In 1943, we have more than double that number. You who have prayed with and for these men and have taught them how to pray, to read the scriptures, and to believe in God, know that they had high ideals and lofty ambition when this call came. They and you had planned their lives in peaceful pursuit of worthy achievement, and to this end you had supervised their training. This sudden changing of their course and way of life; this separation from those they love, with its accompanying loss of inspiration and the supports and safeguards of home environment; this sudden impact with a world at war, with its challenge to all they had believed and known, is subjecting that training to a test more grueling than anything you or they anticipated.\nWe who have observed them in this test, being transformed from boys to men, carrying tremendous responsibility and harnessed to a course of training which only the strong can endure, fearlessly preparing to meet the enemy and to look into the face of death; we who have seen their reaction to the down-drag of temptation, as well as to the uplift of high resolvewe know that you parents have reason to be proud. They were taught at your hearthstone, inspired by your example, and with pride and honor they carry the banners and standards of home and Church\nPage 525\nto all parts of the world in numbers tenfold greater than our normal missionary corps.\nThough their duty calls them far from home, and though their present discipline and training is in other hands, though they have reached maturity in a day and are strong and self-reliant and unafraid, still they want to feel that you are near them. They look to you for encouragement and faith. Being reminded that someone believes in them, is praying for them, is a real safeguard in the hour of temptation, an effective spur to high morale. They must knowand you must tell themthat they are trusted, that you have no doubt of the quality of their manhood and the integrity of their character. They will respond to the trust you place in them, will strive to be worthy of your confidence. They will spread their wings to the lifting power of your faith in them.\nThey hunger and thirst for word from home and anxiously watch for the arrival of the mail. If you could be present at a mail delivery in a desert camp and see their eager and expectant faces as they wait for their names to be called; if you could note, as we have done, the dejection and utter loneliness of the few to whom no mail has come, and see them crawl into their pup tents, homesick to the marrow of their bones; if you could know, as Satan knows, that at such moments their resistance is at low ebb, and that it is then he can get in some of his most effective work, you would make sure that every week would see at least one letter on its way to them.\nWe need not urge the mothers to write to their sons, as they are usually prompt and constant, but too often we hear young men say, \"Gee, I wish Dad would write.\" Fathers, they need the strength which your words will bring to them. Your letter may arrive at a moment when it will save your boy from ruin.\nAs we waited for a train in a small town near a camp at midnight, we saw a lad sitting on the station platform. We asked him why he was alone, and where his buddies were. \"They have gone for a night of revelry,\" he said, \"and I am waiting to ride back to camp with them.\" When asked why he had not gone with them, he took a letter from his pocket and said, \"It's from my Dad.\" He read one paragraph to us, which in substance was as follows: \"I'm proud to have a son who can be trusted, who will meet every temptation manfully. Your mother and I believe in you.\" \"I'd be a traitor,\" said the lad, \"if with this letter in my pocket, I'd disgrace those who trust me like that. I'd rather die than let them down.\" What would have happened if that father had not written? Who would have shared the blame, if the boy had gone astray? Here, as elsewhere, there are casualties because of too little and too late.\nIt is a soul-searching experience to have your letters returned with a notation that your son has gone where letters cannot reach him.\nA good mother, in a small town, before she bade her only son goodby, embroidered her initials on the inside of his inner coat pocket. She did not say anything about it. When the boy got to camp, he saw the letters and recognized them as his\n\nTO THE PARENTS OF SERVICE MEN\nmother's initials. That evening he wrote this sentence: \"Dear Mom: I want to thank you for putting those letters inside my coat pocket. I'll try to see to it that the coat does not go any place where your name could not go.\" That boy is safe in the army.\nTHE Church is doing much to keep contact with these men. They have received tickets of identification and service men's Church directories. We are now distributing the special pocket-size edition of The Book of Mormon and Principles of the Gospel. These are sent free to all men in the service, and New Testaments are furnished by other groups. Wherever it is possible, these men are being visited by members of the Priesthood, who organize them into groups that meetings may be held wherever they may go. We get word that Church services are being held by them on various battlefronts, in Australia, Alaska, Africa, Asia, Europe, and America; but nothing which the Church may do can take the place of letters of love and encouragement from home.\nBut we must not write letters which have a depressing effect upon our sons. We should not emphasize the worries and despondencies which may annoy us at the time of writing. Nor should we criticize the conduct of the war or our leadership in our letters, as confidence and loyalty are basic to effective military service. Our letters should be buoyant, cheerful, full of hope. They should carry the contagion of a triumphant spirit.\nOur men are now fighting to determine whether we shall have a country, homes, and churches, for\n527\nthese are definitely in danger. For their sakes, we must guard our inherited forms of freedom and preserve the kind of society for which they are fighting. We must resist with all our power every attempt to introduce alien isms into our American system. But it is neither necessary nor wise to harrow up their feelings with political irritations, nor plant seeds of doubt where courage waits on faith.\nKeeping contact with them during their service with the armed forces, understanding something of their problems, retaining their confidence by keeping them assured of our love, will insure their cooperation in the stupendous and delicate task which will confront all parents when the boys come home.\nThese 30,000 to 40,000 Latter-day Saint men will not return the same boys who went away. Some will have done a lot of sober thinking, will have discovered that in material and scientific fields old methods and the thinking which went with them did not suffice to meet the new demands. Their strong young minds will demand not only answers but reasons for those answers. They will feel the need of an assuring hand. We must be prepared to guide when the way seems dark, when heavy strain has impaired their vision; to help solve their problems, economic, educational, and spiritual; to convince them that truth is ageless and unchanging, and that there are some eternal, intangible verities.\nOthers will have become accustomed to acting on emotional impulses, will almost have forgotten how to think. They may not be willing to accept as true all that has authoritative sanc-\n528\ntion. An up-to-date knowledge of our changing world, an appreciation of their viewpoint will be needed, if these bewildered and soul-hungry young men returning from the battlefield are to be given bread and not a stone.\nSome of them will have lost their way, will be disillusioned and discouraged. Some of them will have yielded to temptation and will need help to regain self-confidence and the courage to try again. As they come back to the reserve lines which are held by us, they must find understanding, confidence and courage, intelligence and faith. We must keep the spiritual home fires burning by which to warm them back to vigor when they come in from this awful storm.\nNow is the time to begin to prepare for their coming, to take thought of the futureclear, rational, prayerful thoughtbefore it is too late. Those of them who return with physical wounds will be scientifically treated in the best institutions in the world with specialists in attendance. Everything possible will be done to restore their health, to heal their wounds, to compensate for lost abilities by establishing them in some suitable activity.\nBut upon the parents and the Church will rest the responsibility, not only of supplementing what the government may do, but of reestablishing their faith in life and in themselves. Spiritual hospitalization also calls for specialists who are dedicated to their tasks.\nYour tasks may be difficult and your problems baffling, but when we consider the Master's promise to those who \"do it unto the least of these,\" we may know our first duty is to guard and guide our own, if we are to hear His approving, \"Well done.\"\nOur greeting, then, includes a plea to keep in touch with our service men, to write only such letters as will buoy them up and give them hope and confidence and courage, to start today to make provision for their homecoming, and to pray for guidance as we undertake the task of postwar rehabilitation.\nWhile they are in foreign lands, fighting to defend democracy, we will hold her banners so high at home that when they come marchingsailingflying back to a chastened but triumphant America, in gratitude to God they'll say, \"Surely this was worth fighting for,\" and they whose sons will not come back will humbly say, \"Amen.\""

And now by that same power he has been nominated for this exalted place.\nJohn Smith, the great-grandfather of George Albert, and a presiding Patriarch of the Church was an uncle of the Prophet Joseph Smith.

KIMBALL\nSPENCER WOOLLEY KIMBALL, who was called to become a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles in July 1943, comes to the circle of the General Authorities of the Church with a rich heritage of Mormon pioneer ancestry and a varied and wide experience in Church discipline.\nHis father, Andrew Kimball, was the son of that close friend and counselor of Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Ann Alice Gheen. His mother, Olive Woolley, was a daughter of Edwin Dilworth Woolley and Mary Ann Olpin. Brother Woolley served as bishop of the 13th Ward for many years, the ward in which President\nPage 530\nGrant lived as a boy, and was also the business manager of President Young.\nElder Spencer Kimball was born in Salt Lake City, March 28, 1895, the sixth child in a family of eleven. When he was three years old, his father, who for ten years had been mission president of the Indian Territory, later the Central States Mission, was called to Arizona to serve as stake president of St. Joseph Stake, over which he presided for over twenty-six years, until his death, serving as a civic, educational, economic, and religious leader during the pioneer era.\nHere the young Spencer had close personal contact with prominent state officials and Church leaders, including President Joseph F. Smith and President Heber J. Grant. Under such circumstances Spencer absorbed the Church program and learned Church discipline.\nThrift and industry became a part of his life when still a mere child. His father gave to him and his sister Alice the potato crop from a small plot of land. The children dug the potatoes and putting them in their little red wagon, they sold all their crop, retaining the money except for ten per cent which the wise father had taught them should go for tithing. Among Spencer Kimball's papers today are tithing receipts from his potato-selling days to the current year.\nThe new member of the Twelve is prominent in the Southland where he is favorably known by many Ari-\n(Continued on page 555)"

President Howells is\n(Continued on page 566)\n\nL. D. S. Men In The Armed Service\nElder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union\nTHE problem of evil, both physical and moral, is one of the most difficult of solution. It has been a puzzle to many great thinkers, through the ages, in the realms of both religion and philosophy. Yet evil in this world seems to be necessary. In the language of Jesus, \"Woe unto the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh.\" (Matt. 18:7)\nWar is one of these offenses, and insofar as we are concerned at present, it \"must needs be.\" It has now become our responsibility to administer woe to those by whom the war came.\nA major problem for American soldiers is to see that they do not permit the war to bring upon themselves moral and spiritual deterioration, however ghastly the combat may be, or however tempting the opportunities offered them for moral relaxation. Maintaining high moral and spiritual standards is one of the most helpful means of bringing the war to a speedy end. Furthermore, the character qualities of the returning soldier-citizens will be a major factor in establishing a just and lasting peace.\nWhat are the obligations of Latter-day Saint men in the armed forces other than mere performance of their military duties? They have obligations to God and to their fellowmen that are most binding. They are fighting to uphold the sacred rights of man, not for themselves alone, but for all mankind. Their first allegiance is to God and the God-given principles for which they, as Latter-day Saints, stand. These are not at variance with their obligations to their country and their fellowmen everywhere. Their own individual comfort and personal safety are subordinate to these higher religious obligations and their own spiritual salvation.\nIt is a great mistake for any man, under any circumstances, to lower his moral and religious standards either to harmonize his conduct with the crowd, or to indulge his appetites and passions. Any popularity or satisfactions thus gained are very fleeting and ultimately disastrous. A little use of the moral imagination, foreseeing remote consequences of conduct, will make this clear, and should be a powerful factor in forestalling such grave mistakes.\nStrict adherence to the high standards of the gospel not only preserves the self-respect of the individual, but it also secures the respect of fair-minded, thinking associates. These persons have high regard for one who adheres strictly to the standards of conduct to which he is committed as a member of a religious body. This, however, does not mean that a man should behave as did many of the Pharisees of New Testament times. A holier-than-thou attitude is always obnoxious. It is the opposite of that attitudehumility and\n(Continued on page 553)\nPage 533"

Taylor\nNINETY years ago when the Bee Hive House was being built, with its spacious rooms, lovely recessed windows, and dignified encircling porch, it must have appeared as a veritable palace to the pioneers. From its outlook tower was afforded an unobstructed view of the entire valley. New trains of emigrants could be seen as soon as they emerged from Emigration Canyon, and Indian bands detected when still many miles away.\nAlthough 1855 is given as the date of the completion of the house, brief entries in the journal of Truman O. Angell, architect, show that it was planned early in 1852. The first mention of Brigham Young's new house was made January 7, 1852. This entry gives a glimpse of the many projects under way at that time:\n... the president then asked what jobs on hand not finished that we expected to finish in 1852. He then names the Tabernacle, Eldredge House, Benson, Parley P. Pratt's, L. T. Johnson, B. Young barn, B. Young office, barn on the Church farm, State House, wall around Temple Square, if possible build a house for the historian and one for Brigham Young.\nOther entries concerning the house are found under the dates:\nFebruary 3-4, '52Took minutes for plan of Brigham Young's house.\nFebruary 7-15I have been engaged on a multitude of subjects. The chief of which was on the governor's house, making out the design &C.\nApril 28, '53Called for the earth to be cleared of rubbish that I might stake out the president's house.\nPage 534\nMay 3, '53Laid out the president's house or found the corners... The wind blew too much to proceed further. Left the work and went to my office, made ready the bill for timber and joists for said house.\nMay 4, '53Been this day, until four o'clock afternoon, sticking stakes for various partitions and showing the workman where and how to trace them at digging out the earth.\nMay 9, '53Continued the design of details of the president's house. It is to be a good house.\nMay 16thThis day I have been at the design of the observatory of the president's house.\nNov. 25, '53I went from my room to the president's house to take the oversight of the erection. I found it my duty to act as the foreman of the mason work as the building was difficult to build.\nA reference telling of the completion of the Bee Hive House is found in a letter of August 3rd, 1855, written by Heber C. Kimball and published in the Millennial Star, November 17, 1855. He gives many details of progress in Zion, one item stating that:\nPresident Young's first big house is now finished and complete and also the Church office. They are now putting the shingles on his second big house and they will have it enclosed this week.\nAn early application of the name \"Bee Hive\" to his house, before it was built, is found in the Journal History:\nJuly 9, 1852Thomas Bullock commenced clerking in my new office, immediately west of my \"Bee-Hive Mansion.\" (History of Brigham Young, page 62.)\nIt would appear from these two references that the governor's office\nTHE BEE HIVE HOUSE 535\nBEE HIVE HOUSE AS IT APPEARED PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1855\nwas built before the president's office. A careful study of an old photograph of the Bee Hive, Lion House, and Church Office buildings from the files in the Historian's Office, reveals some interesting facts. There is no date on the picture, but as the Lion does not appear on the battlement porch, it was taken before Oct. 31, 1855 as the Deseret News, volume 5, page 269, of that date, tells of the placement of the Lion. The picture shows that the office buildings, which for long years have been one unit, were originally two buildings. A magnifying glass reveals the inscription \"Governor's Office\" on one building and \"President's Office\" and \"Tithing Office\" on the other. The picture shows the original size of the Bee Hive House with the north portion of the building only a story and a half high. Across the front of the roof is a decorative motif, later removed.\nThe spacious two-story porch with its colonial columns is one of the outstanding features of this house today. Yet for almost twenty years the upstairs porch had no roof. A picture of the first bicycle made in Utah, in 1872, taken near the Eagle Gate, shows the porch of the Bee Hive House having its round posts changed to square pillars and being carried up the two full stories.\nIn building the Bee Hive House, cut granite was used for the foundation, red sandstone for flagging, steps, and cellar floors. The 24-inch walls and 15-inch main partitions were of sun-baked adobe, while pine from nearby canyons furnished the heavy timbers and the wood for inside trim. The outside walls were plastered and tinted a straw color. The woodwork was painted white. Green shutters were hung on all large windows.\nTHE most detailed and enlightening description of this house has been given by Clarissa Young Spencer, a daughter of Brigham Young,\nSOUTHEAST PARLOR AS IT APPEARS TODAY\nA view of the back parlor may be seen in the mirror.\nwhose home was within its walls until six years after her marriage. Her account makes it possible to visualize some of the rooms and their furnishings.*\nOn either side of the wide front door were tall panel windows with small panes of glass. There was a beautiful silver doorknob and an ingenious metal slide that rang a doorbell of highly resounding quality. The entrance was in the center of the south wall and a wide hall extended the length of the main building. At the north end was a long staircase with native or grained mahogany balustrade. The\n*Information gleaned from manuscript, \"The Bee-Hive House 1854-1888\" by Clarissa Young Spencer, and her book, One Who Was Valiant, Spencer-Harmer.\nwalls of the hall were painted to represent great blocks of marble in shades of tan and brown. The woodwork was grained to represent oak. The stair carpet was held in place by German silver stair rods. A lamp on the newel posts supplied light at night.\nOff the hall to the right was one of the two spacious parlors of the home. It had recessed windows on the south and east. The walls were painted a soft green and the floor was covered with a three-ply ingrain carpet. A high mantel piece was built between the east windows. A coal-oil lamp at each end of the mantel supplied the light. On each side of the clock in the center was a china dog with long brown ears. A\n\nTHE BEE HIVE HOUSE 537\nBRIGHAM YOUNG'S BEDROOM AS IT APPEARS TODAY\nlarge drop-leaf table stood in the middle of the room. A secretary was placed on the north wall and a square United Makers grand piano. On the west one. Comfortable chairs with cherry stain and gold trim made especially for the house were to be found in front of each window, and about the center table. There were small chairs for the children. This room was used as a sitting room as well as a parlor. It was the place President Young ate his morning meal. Dinner was eaten at four-thirty each day with his families in the Lion House.\nPresident Young's bedroom was opposite the parlor. The woodwork was grained oak, the wall a soft pink. It had two recessed windows with Nottingham curtains. A wall mirror and his washstand were between them. On the west wall were the doors leading to his office, a \"Lady Franklin\" stove and a wall cupboard where, among other things, he kept rock candy and raisins as a treat for his children. A large chair, a table, secretary and bed, with a bedside table and high brass candlesticks completed the furnishings.\nOn the second floor was the main parlor and the blue and pink bedrooms. The pink room was Clarissa's. The woodwork was grained in bird's-eye maple. This room was sixteen feet square. In recent years the high ceiling has been lowered five feet.\nThe parlor, or \"Long Hall\" as it was called, faced southeast on the second floor. This had a fine coved ceiling with modeled plaster molding running the length of the room. The floor was covered with\n538\na pale gray carpet with a pattern of bunches of roses and green leaves. There were lace curtains and rose-colored lambrequins on gold cornices at the windows. Underneath a large mirror in a beautiful gold frame was a table containing a basket of flowers made of colored shells. Two \"Lady Franklin\" stoves supplied the heat. Two large couches constructed so that when pushed together they made a fine bed, some rocking chairs, and decorated straight wooden chairs completed the furnishings. Light was furnished from the coal-oil lamps with attractive frosted shades of two chandeliers hanging from the lofty ceiling.\nThe stairway leading to the top\nfloor was circular. Here there were two garret rooms just alike. In each was a half diamond-shaped window. From the east room a short flight of steps led to the observatory tower on which stood the beehive. The narrow rail-enclosed roof platform extended the width of the house. The Journal History of July 4, 1867, page 7, tells of a band playing from this elevated spot as part of the day's celebration.\nThe addition at the north of the house was a story and a half. There were located the buttery, \"the men's dining room,\" the big kitchen, bedrooms, and the room housing the family store. The dining room was heated in early days by a fireplace, later replaced by a stove. A large table surrounded by chairs stood in the center. At each end of the table was a six-inch pedestal holding a coal-oil lamp. A bright rag carpet laid over straw covered the floor. At the north end was a built-in bake oven.\nBack of the dining room was the kitchen. It had all the conveniences available at that time. There was a washstand with a roller towel, a looking glass, and a tin wash basin. There was a large sink completely lined with tin by the kitchen door. Outside that door the waste water was thrown into a sunken stone square with an outlet that emptied into a cesspool, later a drain from the sink to the hopper was built. The kitchen had deep cupboards reaching to the ceiling with space underneath for wood box and later for coal hods. Next was a large cook stove, then another set of cupboards from floor to ceiling with drawers for towels and table linens, and shelves for pots and pans. Two large tables with chairs at each\nTHE BEE HIVE HOUSE 539\nTHE BEE HIVE HOUSE\nend provided working space. Both the dining room and kitchen walls were whitewashed.\nThe stairways to the cellar and upper story led from the men's dining room. In the large cool stone-flagged cellar were cupboards filled with great earthen jars of preserves. There were swinging shelves for the milk pans and a long table with a large polished stone slab for making piecrust in summer.\nFrom cellar to garret there were, in all, fourteen rooms in the original home.\nThe outside of the house was not neglected. Besides a beautiful flower garden there were extensive vegetable gardens and an orchard of fruit trees extending some distance to the east. A high cobblestone wall with tapering circular pillars at regular intervals was built around all of President Young's property. The Eagle Gate, erected in 1859, was the main carriage entrance.\n\"One very fine carriage used only on state occasions, was housed on the southeast corner of the enclosure between the cobblerock wall and the Eagle Gate.... The carriage was run into the carriage house on heavy planks which were laid over a shallow tank of water. An elevated trough carried the water into this tank and was used for washing the carriage and emptied into the running stream.\"*\nThis stone wall remained until a year after President Young's death. The Journal History of December 16, 1878, page 2, states: The last two or three weeks an iron 'ornamental fence has been put in front of President B. Young's Bee-Hive House, the wall having been torn down to make (Continued on page 556) \"Information gleaned from manuscript, \"The Bee Hive House 1854-1888,\" by Clarissa Young Spencer and her book, One Who Was Valiant, Spencer-Harmer. Short-story Writing Pear] Spencer Department of English, Logan Senior High School Another article on Short-story Writing by Pearl Spencer appeared in the June-July issue of the Magazine, page 389. DITORS agree that the chief difference between the gifted amateur and the writer who gets his stories published is not sincerity, understanding, or keen observation, for in any of these an amateur may be actually superior to a given professional. No, one must have another qualification to win prizes or sell storiesa technique. Having learned how to use material effectively, a writer may produce good, bad, or mediocre stories, according to her conscience and talents; but at least she'll have a possibility of marketing them. Until she has acquired a technique, however, she must be satisfied with the plaudits of loyal friends and the joy of writing for the fun of it. To point out some of the elements of short-story technique, \"Eighteen in August,\" by Roma Rose, is here reprinted by permission of the author and Collier's magazine. This story has been chosen because it is the kind of story anyone of us might - think of writing, and, at the same time, it is expertly enough done to be acceptable to a magazine that places a very high premium indeed on expertness. In considering the story, \"Eighteen in August,\" we find that there is nothing new about the theme: the struggle between the possessive mother and her child. Many authors have capitalized on its poignancy; it Page 540 has appeared in Therecurrently, and it is within anyone's ken, for one need not leave her neighborhood to encounter it, If the choice of theme is the first step in planning the story, a rather general plot situation must next be formulated. In this story, a young man, at the one moment when he might best free himself from his mother's possessiveness, cannot tear himself away, and as a result lives a life essentially incomplete. So far, any of us could do about as well. But now the question arises as to how to tell the story. How to depict the struggle and the decision. How to dramatize the long, empty years. How to give a striking conclusion to a story in which the whole point is that nothing happensgive it short-story form, in fact. \"Eighteen in August\" is one answer to these questions. In a few hundred words, Mrs. Rose tells how Professor Locke diffidently persuades young Woodbridge to make the decision that offers him freedom of soul. The rest of the story leaves us alone with the Professor, who did not achieve that freedom for himself. And suddenly we see that the story of the lad is also and primarily the story of the Professor's own youth and the decision he also had to make. The turning point in his life has also SHORT-STORY WRITING been revealed and the life-long consequences of his choice. The all-important unity of the story is never threatened by this device, for it is the Professor's story from the first word. It is seen through his eyes; he creates its emotional tone. We have finished with the lad when he makes his decision. It is with the Professor that we survey the future. Unity is also insured by the clarity with which the issue is defined: the right of a son to possess his own soul. It is in no sense a plea that boys go into the army instead of medicine, that they marry before they march away, or that they ignore the advice of their mothers. And notice that the issue is defined by the characters, not lectured about by the author. Note also the care with which the author has worked to make her characters convincing even though they are types, of course, not individuals in the true sense. The mothers are charming, vigorous, companionable women, the kind who could hold intelligent sons. The young man and the old are sensitive, loyal, and conscientious, but without the emotional drive that translates feelings into action. They are also the sort whose work is absorbing enough to make an almost satisfactory substitute for other things, leaving not too much time for \"quiet desperation.\" Another important part of the plot construction is the preparation made for the Professor's words to become a decisive factor in the boy's life. Too often a talk, a picture, a single incident will be made the deciding factor in a story without the reader's seeing why it has such power. This has been a baleful weakness in too many \"moral\" stories. A reader will 541 accept the fact that the right word at the right time may alter a whole life, but he certainly ought to know why it was the right word and why the time was ripe for it. Study the extreme economy of explanation, the point where the unskillful writer so often bogs down. It would be an excellent exercise to expand this story, to discover whether its effectiveness would be increased by more detail. The sparseness of description may bother you, and again, it would be instructive to amplify it and compare results. (And here it might be mentioned parenthetically, that the stories in the files of the Magazine reveal that Utah women have a feeling for atmosphere, for the homely, memorable detail, for the color of every-day living that lends authenticity to many an otherwise almost formless nartrative. It is a gift to cultivate, never to sacrifice to glibness and stock phrases. ) In writing this story, of course, Mrs. Rose was working under the severe restrictions imposed by the short-short story''a most difficult form' she writes, and one which too often emerges a sketch or incident. It will be interesting to decide if and where she might have expanded it under different length requirements, or whether it has the \"inevitable length\" that Somerset -Maugham uses as one test of a good story. And when you come to the end of \"Eighteen in August\" pause long to admire the ending. It's hard to get a story of this kind ended effectively. When an author sums up a story in so perfect a bit of dramatic irony, we take off our hats to a job well done. 542 Along with any plea for aspiring writers to struggle to master the techniques of their craft, a warning should be sounded against too much devotion to the authors who have achieved publication with deft, \"smart\" writing which has little else to recommend it. This cheapening of talent can be followed in its stages by reading the groping but impassioned early work of some of our living American writers, and then comparing it with their deft but unmoving and insignificant current stories. They are like people who acquire social aplomb at the expense of character and individuality. For although sincerity, an honest point of view, and genuine emotion cannot, in and of themselves, make good stories, no stories can be worth the writing without them. Eighteen In August By Roma Rose  Reprinted from Collier's for May 15, 1943, by permission of the author and Collier's. ROFESSOR LOCKE listened, nodding soberly from time to time. \"With his 1. Q. Of 137,\" the woman was saying, \"he can carry this schedule. That leaves Saturday afternoons and Tuesdays and Thursdays from four to six for his laboratory work, and, of course, Sundays.\" She was the mother of one of his studentsa tall, handsome woman with straight black brows in a strong and intelligent face. She had come to get her son through his premedical course in two years instead of three, so that he would be deferred from the draft as a full medical student as soon as he was eighteen. Professor Locke glanced again at the record of George Woodbridge on the desk before him. Nothing but A's and B's. One of his best students. \"It might be possible,\" he said. \"But I don't think it is advisable.\" \"Nonsense,\" Mrs. Woodbridge said, looking at him with a contradicting stare. \"He hasn't been doing so well lately.\" \"He's worried, naturally,\" she said. \"Once we get this settled, he'll be all right.\" \"T don't believe he can do it even if I were to allow him to try. But I'll go into the matter thoroughly. His transcripteverything. I do not feel justified in giving my consent without considering the entire case.\" She rose to go. \"I know you won't be too academic about this, Professor. It is more than just a matter of credits and points.\" She managed a smile, charming, persuasive. '\"'As long as I live, I will feel that you have saved my son for me.\" \"I will consider it carefully,\" he said. \"Goodby, Mrs. Woodbridge.\" Professor Locke walked down the hall and found young Woodbridge in the laboratory. \"Mr. Woodbridge, EIGHTEEN IN AUGUST I want to speak to you. As soon as vou can, come into my office.\" The young man_ straightened. \"Yes, sir. J can come now.\" He had smooth, light brown hair, and he ran his hand over it. His eyes were gray and larger than his mother's. He must resemble his father, Professor Locke thought. \"Your mother has been here.\" The young man blushed as he walked along. \"She said she was coming in.\" \"So you want to hurry up and be a doctor?\" \"Wellyes, sir.\" At the office, the young man opened the door for Professor Locke and then followed him inside. \"Sit down, Mr. Woodbridge. What made you want to study medicine?\" \"Well, I always knew that's what I was going to do. My mother and I have talked about it and planned for it since I was a kid.\" Professor Locke fingered the paperweight on his desk. \"Let's seeyou'll be eighteen in August... How do you feel about going into the Army?\" The boy breathed once before he lifted his eyes. His features, clearcut though they were, now blurred with indecision. \"I really don't know, sir.\" There was a pause. \"It doesn't seem like the Great Adventure, certainly. And I'm not attracted by any of the hero stuffbut I keep feeling\" He hurried now, faster as he went\"I keep feeling I ought to go. I'm not married. I'm not prepared for my profession yet. What I mean is: I haven't as much to lose as most of them.\" 543 \"So you've decided\" Professor Locke prompted helpfully. The boy flushed. \"But my mother\" he said. \"And of course, as she says, we'll be needing doctors after it's over. It can't last forever.\" He swallowed. \"Tll do my best, sir, to carry the work.\" \"T'm sure you would.\" Professor Locke paused. \"In your own mind, though, you think you should go. Is that right?\" \"T don't know for sure. But I'm afraid that's the way it looks to me.\" He put both his feet firmly on the floor. \"Sometimes,\" Professor Locke said, \"it is difficult to distinguish between responsibility and dependency in our relations with our fellow human beings.\" The young man was thoughtful. \"I'm not sure I know what you mean, sir.\" \"Whether we are responsible for them, or dependent on them,\" the professor explained. \"The distinction is fine.\" For the first time in years, he could remember Katharine's face clearly as they stood on the steps of the Chemistry Building that spring night in 1917. And the bitterness in her voice as she had said, \"I know why she wants us to wait until you come back... But it's not her life. It's yours and mine.\" \"The distinction is fine,\" he said again. \"Sometimes almost indistinguishable.\" The boy looked at him, puzzled, trying to understand. Professor Locke knew that look well. \"I talk like a bad textbook,\" he said and laughed in his classroom manner. \"Let me put it this way: 544 It is exceedingly difficult to hurt those whom we love, or who love us.\" He knew he was hiding behind words but he was getting closer. \"Yes, sir. It is.\" So difficult, Professor Locke thought, looking at this boy's face, at the uncertainty in his young eyes, that he will not be able to do it alone. \"What I am trying to say to you, George, is this: In the life of nearly every man, there comes a time when he must say no to his mother. When his own judgment must be his only guide.\" \"You really think so, sir?\" The boy's voice was hopeful. \"I know it.\" The professor did not move until the words had come, harshly. Then he leaned back in his chair, stiff and brittle... old. \"I'm glad to hear you say that, sir. I believe that, too. But my mother \" He hesitated. \"She's pretty determined. It won't be easy.\" I could settle it, Professor Locke thought quickly. I could say: No, he can't carry this heavy schedule. He's too young. But that's not the point. \"It's up to you, Woodbridge,\" he said. For one long, wavering moment, the boy sat there. He ran his hand nervously over his smooth brown hair. Then it was over. \"Ill do it,\" he said quietly, surely. He got up. \"I don't know how. It will be awful. But thank you, sir.\" He took a step to the door. \"Thank you, sir.\" Professor Locke came around the desk. \"I am not sending you out to die,\" he said, self-conscious at his own seriousness. \"That is not my decision to make. Nor yours. This is something else. I don't know if you understand, but I admire you. I hope you will come back. I'd like to see you finish here. Good luck, Mr. Woodbridge.\" He put out his hand, and the young man clasped it. ROFESSOR LOCKE sat down slowly. His heart was pounding. He was very tired, but he must get home now; he was expected. He was never later than five o'clock. He filled his brief case with orderly stacks of papers. He buttoned his overcoat carefully to the top and went out. ' His mother was waiting in her chair, her thick white hair lookin vigorous and handsome and wel kept. Her knitting lay in her lap. He bent and touched his lips to the cheek she offered. \"And how was it today, son?\" She was always so interested in everything he did. \"Did you have a hard day? You look tired.\" \"No,\" he said. \"I had a good day.\" \"I'm so glad. What happened?\" \"Nothing.\" Usually he told her the little high lights, arranging them with care, making them seem important. \"I had some conferences... One of my best students is going into the Army.\" \"What a shame!\" She sighed and picked up her knitting. \"You know, dear,\" she said, \"I'm so thankful that you're over the draft age. I couldn't let you go. You're all I've got.\" She gave him a bright, loving smile. \"Yes. Mother,' he said. \"And you're all I've got.\" He went into his study and closed the door. Dixie Pioneers Florence Ivins Hyde MOST stories of pioneer life depict the conquering of a wilderness by men and women who trekked through snows, forded treacherous rivers, climbed mountainsides, ate the dust of the desert, fought starvation, and drank the brackish waters of new lands, and, for the most part, they never turned back. We sometimes wonder, why they didn't. The Dixie pioneers of Utah were no exception to the rule. In the ride between Salt Lake City and St. George, as one drinks in the beauty of the peach and cherry blossoms, the rock formations, unsurpassed in coloring, it is difficult to realize the sacrifice that went into the roads that make this pleasure possible. Only a few years ago there were no roads. They had to be made as the people went along, and only the stout of heart could survive the difficulties. Still, their pioneer life was not all tragedy. There was some romance and some humor, but these were the \"purple patches\" of their lives. For 'the most part, their way was long and weary, and life was a constant struggle. Perhaps the women of this group felt the hardships the most. They saw their husbands grow old before their time. They watched their children die young, and there were times when they heard their children cry for food. But through it all they stood by their men. One woman has said that more than once she had decided to \"'set her husband up\" for taking them into such an undesirable place, but when he would come home at night, he \"looked so tired she hadn't the heart.\" The life experiences of my own grandparents and parents are typical of a class among the Mormons of that time. They hardly became settled in one place before they were called to settle a new place: always trying to make something from nothing. To us who live in this world of ultra-sophistication, the stories of this pioneer life appear like the grimmest reality. In those early days the journey from Salt Lake to St. George, which now can be made in eight hours, required four weeks. Each night the tents had to be pitched, beds made down, and food cooked. Occasionally it became necessary to \"lay over\" a day to wash clothes and bake bread, which had to be done in a small bake skillet. Sometimes they were delayed because their horses and oxen sank in the mud, and it was with great difficulty that they were rescued. In certain places quicksand was encountered from which the animals were never recovered. In case of a storm they must spend a day drying their bedding over the bushes. Journeying farther South, the sun grew hot, the wind dry, dust and sand and more dust and sand, but through it all they journeyed on. Some of those original pioneers were men and women who had known the comforts that comparative wealth can give. A Page 545 546 few were of the type who could never take root in new soil, but, on the whole, these Dixie pioneers never questioned the wisdom of their choice in following the command of their leaders. As they prepared for their journey into the South in 1861, their instructions were to \"travel light.\" 'Their leader, Erastus Snow, my grandfather, said to them: I do not feel that it will be wisdom for us to load ourselves down with household furniture, but if a woman wishes to take her rocking chair along, let her take it, for that will probably make her more comfortable than any other article of furniture. I wish our brethren to supply themselves with tools to work in the ground, such as spades, shovels, picks, etc. We can find plenty of timber for making bedsteads and other articles of furniture. He asked to have a carding machine taken, as well as any musical instruments, music books or school books that the people could collect. Their instructions were to locate at the junction of the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers, and by the time they reached Black Volcanic Ridge, it was apparent that they had a difficult problem to solve. It was here that they unloaded and dismantled their wagons, letting them down over the cliffs, one part after another. It was here, too, that the wife of Johnny Pym, an English convert, gave birth to a child. Both the mother and child were let down over the ridge. One wonders how these pioneers endured those first hard years in southern Utah. For thirty years they fought the elements, before they finally subdued them. Their crops dried up because no rain came in time, or too much rain brought floods which destroyed their dams. But when these dams went out, others were built. At one time it rained forty days. Rivers and creeks overflowed their banks carrying along barns, homes, furniture, even men, women, and children, some of whom were never rescued. But Erastus Snow's motto was, \"Remain and conquer.\" He said: Never travel without a shovel no matter where you go. And if you see a rock that should be removed, remove it, and if you see a low place that needs to be filled, get out and throw in some dirt. Hardly were their tents pitched before they laid their plans for a permanent settlement with houses, corrals, and fences. My grandfather, Israel Ivins, had surveyed the land so that the allotments could be made. Men were sent to scout out a road into the mountains in order to obtain wood, cedar, and pine, for furniture. Every male over fourteen years of age was required to work three days each year in improving roads. All kinds of artisans had been called to Dixie by Brigham Young, masons, blacksmiths, painters, plasterers, and carpenters. One man they called '\"\"Chairmaker Bleak,\" who was an artist in his line. The beds were four-poster beds with rope springs, on which were laid straw or cornhusk mattresses, or if a family was lucky, a feather bed. Chairs were built with rawhide seats. The people lived in tents and wagons, often sleeping in beds wet by the rain. If the sun shone next day, the bedding was hung on bushes to dry. These tents were called Sibleytents and were round, with two doors opposite each other. As time went DIXIE PIONEERS 547 ERASTUS SNOW, LEADER OF THE DIXIE PIONEERS, AND ELIZABETH ASHBY SNOW, HIS WIFE, WITH THEIR FIRST CHILD, ELIZABETH SNOW (MRS. ANTHONY W. IVINS) on, Grandfather Snow found it necessary to build a little room back of one door for an extra bedroom. That winter President Young came down and occupied that room. Mother tells of being awakened in the night by a terrific wind, and seeing grandma standing in the middle of the tent holding up the pole, while grandfather drove deeper the stakes that held the ten. This tent room served as living room, dining room, and bedroom. In summer, the family cooked, washed, ironed, and ate outside in a bowery covered with grapevines. Often, just at meal time, a strong wind would come up, filling the food with sand.  DURING these early years the mail came through only once in several weeks. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the war news came on strips of paper of different colors, about eight inches wide and one yard long. They were called telegrams. Grandfather Snow subscribed for these telegrams, and when they arrived, the men would come together in his tent where the news was read by Brother Bleak, who \"was-a very good reader.\" The struggle which took so much from the people physically, developed their resourcefulness, and they really enjoyed solving many of their problems. When they first arrived, their children's dresses were made from wagon covers colored with dye made from \"dockroot,\" logwood, and blueing. In dyeing wool, if they wanted it variegated in color, strings 548 were tied tightly around the yarn at intervals. Until a woolen factory was established in the nearby town of Washington, the mothers spun the yarn and wove it into cloth for their children's clothes, or they learned to make over dresses from used ones sent them by relatives in faraway places. As they became more prosperous, the little girls wore red flannel skirts and white blouses called \"posies,\" blouses with little peplums. Caps for the children were made of numerous layers of paper pasted together and shaped over a little brass kettle, then covered with bits of cloth. Hats for men were made from the gleanings from the wheat fields. My grandmother would braid and sew a man's hat in one day and sell it for five dollars to the gold seekers who passed on their way to California. She would, also, make by hand, in one day, a man's stiff shirt with a tucked bosom, which she would sell for seven dollars. For the first few years, the most serious problem was that of food, which was so scarce the people rarely had enough to eat. The few cows in * the town were called for in the morning by boys who took them into the hills where there was a little grass, and who brought them back at night. Sometimes the children had to wait a long time for the cow to come, and when she did come, they often got \"no more than a teacupful of milk apiece.\" Sometimes the cow strayed away and did not get home at all, and the children went to bed hungry. Breakfast consisted of corn bread and bran coffee, and supper of cornmeal mush. Later, after the flour mill was built, they had griddle cakes made of biscuit dough rolled thin and fried in butter. The hot summers made it almost impossible to keep food palatable. Milk would not keep sweet from morning until night. The butter would melt, the water was warm. All the housewife could do to cool the water was to wrap the water barrel in a wet blanket or carpet. The family dipper always hung on the side of the barrel. Occasionally, relatives from Salt Lake would send a few dried beans or apples. Always. Tucked away in the sack would be found a box of needles or pins, or a spool of thread. The first store was established by men from California, in the basement of the Snow house, called the \"Big House.\" The men were boarded by my grandmother who lived upstairs. When Christmas came, they wished to make her a \"nice\" present, so gave her the \"makings of a rice puddingtrice, eggs, and raisins\"; she furnished the milk. FROM the very beginning these pioneers tried to have a school, even while they lived in tents. Sister Everett and later Sister Snell taught the children to read. My father tells about the boys crawling under the sides of the school tent and running away. \"But,\" he says, \"the girls never ran away.\" The great teacher of the time was Richard Horne. He did for these little children of Dixie what Karl G., Maeser did for the adults of the Church. These early days produced some unique characters, one of whom was \"Aunt Mary Gates,\" a sister of Erastus Snow and wife of Jacob Gates. She had no children of her own, but DIXIE PIONEERS gathered the children of the town around her, and taught them Greek and Roman history, and even astronomy, which she tried to explain by using apples and sometimes oranges for the planets. She developed a unique philosophy. She would declare: Why dress children up and then scold them if they get dirty?... Why iron sheets in hot weather? Why not fold them up and sit on them? It is a great accomplishment to know what to slight.... When a person cooks one chicken for fifteen people, she should make plenty of gravy. No small problem was that of the pioneers' relationship with the Indians, who resented the coming of the white man and on several occasions waylaid travelers and murdered them. Grandfather's method of dealing with them was similar to that of Brigham Young's. When Indians came into St. George in crowds, he would kill a beef and divide it among them. He largely solved the Indian problem, for no one, with the exception of Jacob Hamblin, had greater influence with them. At one time when they were boys, my father and Uncle Willard Snow did not return from a rabbit hunt. Jacob Hamblin went with a group to hunt for them, finding them prisoners at an Indian camp. When he told the Indians that one boy was a son of Erastus Snow, they immediately released them. Old Mokiac was a patriarch, the chief of the Piutes. He had two sons, Mokiac and Limpy, who was crippled. Both were \"mean.\" One day Mokiac appeared at President Snow's home and asked his wife for food. She gave him meat, and bread and butter. Then he demanded tea. She 549 said she had none, whereupon he pulled out his knife and flourished it about to frighten her. Fortunately, her son walked in and the Indian left; but Erastus Snow demanded of Old Mokiac that his son be punished, not by the whites, but by the Indians themselves. He was brought into the town by them and tied to the Liberty Pole where his father whipped him with a black whip, while the people looked on. AS the years passed by, the people began to have more conveniences and could think more of parties, of dramatics, and various types of entertainment. But many of the men who had helped to make this entertainment possible, never lived to see that day. At one time Erastus Snow reported to the Authorities of the Church that they had thirty or forty young widows who would have to rear their families alone. One man who had been \"called\" refused to stay, saying he would not give up his farm up north for the whole of southern Utah. Brother Adams, the poet laureate, wrote a song about it for one of the gatherings, wherein he sang, \"He measured Mormon Dixie by the breadth of his thumbnail.\" Those pioneers of Dixie conquered the wilderness as other pioneers have done. It was a physical struggle to conquer physical obstacles. That strange mysterious thing which prompts men and women to answer the call of duty buoyed them up. They did not want pity nor ask for glory. They left their sons and daughters as a monument to their lives. Many places in the town today have stories behind themwhere they (Continued on page 559) Chastity The following statements are reprinted herewith because of the vital present-day need for the message which they contain: President Joseph F. Smith soTHERE are at least three dangers that threaten the Church within.... As I see these they are the flattery of prominent men in the world, false educational ideas, and sexual impurity. \"But the third subject mentionedpersonal purity, is perhaps of greater importance than either of the other two. We believe in one: standard of morality for men and women. If purity of life is neglected, all other dangers set in upon us like the rivers of waters when the flood gates are opened.\" Gospel Doctrine, pp. 391-392. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. CHASTITY is fundamental to our life and to our civilization. If the race becomes unchaste, it will perish. Immorality has been basic to the destruction of mighty nations in the past. It will bring to dust the mighty nations of the present. ) \"Fyvery one of us who instructs our youth, in whatever place or position, and in whatever capacity, must teach the young people of today to abstain from unchastity. We must surround our teachings with due and proper reserve and modesty. We must approach and teach the youth as the children of God, with spirits that are to live throughout eternity, and tell them plainly and clearly that the laws of God, and of man also, demand that they live chaste. If we shall teach anything less than this, we will destroy our youth and we will bring ourselves under a condemnation which is too great to be fathomed by the human mind. \"In what I have said I include all of us parents. How can we parents face our Maker if we have failed in one featherweight to meet the duty which is ours in these matters? And let us not make the mistakeany of usof assuming that our children are beyond temptation and may not fall. This is a delusion and a snare that will bring us to the very depths. Let every father and every mother, every brother and every sister, stand guard day and night that their loved ones be not seized and carried away by lust. \"You young people, may I directly entreat you to be chaste. Please believe me when I say that chastity is worth more than life itself. This is the doctrine my parents taught me; it is truth. Better die chaste than live unchaste.

Page 551 EDITORIAL 2 VOL. 30 SEPTEMBER 1943 Seek Knowledge IN the threshold of the new educational year in Relief Society, and in the midst of personal trials and sorrows which today form a part of life's pattern for the very great majority of Relief Society members, they will desire, perhaps more than at any other time in their lives, to draw nearer to the Lord, and, by obedience to His commandments, to better merit His blessings. In contemplation of this year's work, each member may ask herself what one thing she may do in order to grow spiritually. Certainly a fundamental law was given to man when the Lord declared, \"It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance\"; and the Prophet Joseph Smith said, \"The principle of knowledge is the principle of salvation.\" One object, therefore, for which all members might strive would be to better learn the principles of salvation in order the better to live in accordance with them. The Prophet Joseph Smith has told us, \"the conditions of God's kingdom are such, that all who are made partakers of that glory, are under the necessity of learning something respecting it, previous to their entering into it.\" As Latter-day Saints, we are candidates for the celestial kingdom, the highest kingdom of which we have any knowledge, and therefore it is essential that each one learn what Page 552 she can of its requirements and laws, in order that she may pattern her life in accordance with its laws, and thus not only prepare herself to dwell therein, but to live a full and abundant life here. The courses of study in Relief Society for the year 1943-44 offer Relief Society members a rich opportunity to gain a greater knowledge of the Gospel. If every member would prayerfully study the lessons as outlined, and the references, and then continue with her reading as her interest might lead her, she would, at the close of the year's lesson work, find herself possessed of far greater knowledge than she does at the present time. The theology lessons, based on The Articles of Faith by Dr. Talmage, will impart information which is fundamental to an understanding of the tenets of the Church. The literature lessons, Bible Literature, using the King James translation of the Bible as a textbook, will lead the student into a study of the Bible and an appreciation of its literary qualities as well. In the Messages to the Home lessons, each member will recognize basic sources of strength which will help her to carry on more valiantly, and by a study of the references for these lessons, she will be guided to the sermons and writings of our great Church leaders. The study of American history, in the social science EDITORIAL department, written from the viewpoint held by Latter-day Saints in regard to the great principle of free agency, of liberty, and of the divine influence exercised in framing our Constitution, will aid Relief Society members, as American citizens, to better uphold fundamental concepts of our Government. Let each Relief Society member, then, seek during this coming season to take greater advantage of the knowledge of spiritual matters to be gained by a study of the courses outlined for Relief Society, and resolve to increase her knowledge of eternal truth. Let her find time for such a study, though it may entail foregoing some reading of current fiction 553 and drama, and. Fewer amusements, none of whose worth can compare with the joy and satisfaction to be derived from a study of the Gospel. By thus increasing her knowledge of Church doctrine, each member will better be able to obey the admonition of Paul who said, \"... Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"M. C. S. L. D. S. Men In The Armed Service (Continued from page 533) charitycommended by Jesus. A humble profession of faith and strict adherence to standards of conduct in conformity with that faith, always, in the long run, win the respect of normal men and women. We have known many examples of this, and also of the reversethe cases of Latter-day Saint men who have lost the respect and confidence of non-Church members because these men failed to live up to the principles of their Church, or seemed to be ashamed of their Church connections and the principles for which their people stand. Firmness of faith in the right, together with stamina and moral courage to practice and to defend the right are outstanding qualities of character. Certainly no Latter-day Saint can afford to be lacking in these character qualities.\nWe sympathize with young men in the armed service of their country in the difficult and hazardous situation in which they are placed. Generally speaking, it is no fault of theirs. It is, however, a sign of weakness for them to let this situation lead them to become reckless as to their moral and religious obligations, and thus toward their own lasting happiness and the happiness of their loved ones. It is to be hoped that these loved ones will not be remiss in doing everything possible to encourage and strengthen their relatives and friends who have been called to face the physical and moral hazards of war.\n\nNotes to the Field\nStake Planning Meeting Recommended During September\nAS in 1942, the General Board, with the special approval of the First Presidency, again recommends that a stake planning meeting be held during the month of September, preliminary to the beginning of regular weekly meetings in October, for all stake board members, ward officers, and class leaders. It is recommended that, wherever possible, this meeting be arranged in connection with a stake priesthood meeting or a stake quarterly conference in order to keep transportation at a minimum.\nThe purpose of this meeting is to stimulate all phases of Relief Society work at the beginning of the 1943-44 season, to preview lesson work and other activities planned for the coming year, and to give whatever instructions and help are deemed necessary by the stake board.\nWe feel sure that all Relief Society officers and class leaders will greatly appreciate this privilege granted by the First Presidency of holding this special meeting for stake and ward officers in order to better prepare for the coming season's work.\nStake Relief Society presidents will please acquaint their respective stake presidents with the recommendation that this special meeting be held and arrange with them as to the most favorable time for calling the meeting. Stake Relief Society presidents are requested to send complete details of this meeting to all ward presidents as soon as possible so that good ward representation may be assured.\nWe are sure that stake board members will make every effort to take full advantage of this special meeting and that they will be well prepared to conduct their respective departments for ward workers at this meeting.\nWard Relief Society Conferences, November 7, 1943\nCONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on the evenings of Fast Sundays, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 7, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual Relief Society conference.\nPage 554\nWard Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons\nNOTES TO THE FIELD\nand other work, near the beginning of the educational season.\nIt is recommended that the conference consist of two meetingsa preliminary meeting for officers, and a general session for all Relief Society members and for all other members of the ward. In order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that visiting teachers on their regular November visits invite all ward members to be present at this meeting and that advance announcements of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.\nA suggested program for the general session of the conference, with detailed instructions for its presentation, will be mailed to each ward Relief Society president in September.\n555\n\nSpencer W.

Banking was his first work, but after eight and a half years of banking experience, he resigned to purchase an interest in a small new struggling insurance business which has since become the leading insurance and realty firm in eastern Arizona. He has derived great pleasure from his farming and livestock operations as well.\nThe Church activities of the new member of the General Authorities have been varied and continuous. When but fourteen, he became an assistant teacher in Sunday School and while yet in high school he was appointed chorister of the stake Sunday School. He sang, for many years, in ward and stake choirs, at times substituting as organist or pianist. His missionary work under President Samuel O. Bennion, in Missouri, was one of the highlights of his life. Upon returning from his mission he became first, stake clerk in 1918, then counselor in the stake presidency in 1924, where he continued to serve until the St. Joseph Stake was divided in 1938, and he was called to be the first stake president of Mt. Graham Stake, the position he was occupying at the time of his call to the apostleship.\nThis is the first time in the history of the Church that an apostle has been called from Arizona, and many people in the seven Arizona stakes will rejoice in his appointment, and business and professional men will feel honored by his call.\nElder Kimball has been favored with a charming wife, who has always been helpful and understanding. Camilla Eyring is the daughter of Edward Christian Eyring and Caroline Romney who lived in Mexico until 1912. Four children have been born to the Kimballs, Spencer LeVan, a commissioned officer in the United States Naval Reserve, Olive Beth, Andrew Eyring, and Edward Lawrence.

Although he has worked with rough characters in mining camps and one summer as a stevedore in a Los Angeles freight yard, as well as dining with European nobility and aristocracy at which\ndinners many different kinds of intoxicants were served, still, due to his strict early training, he has never tasted tea nor coffee, tobacco nor liquor.\nWith extreme humility, Elder Spencer Woolley Kimball will enter upon his new duties after the October conference where he will be presented for the sustaining vote of that body.\n\nThe Bee Hive House\n(Continued from page 539)\nway for it.

Young.* He took down the story-and-a-half on the north and built three floors, bringing the new addition to the same height as the original building. Many rooms were added, the most important being the large east entrance hall and the spacious back parlor. A heavy carved oak Dutch door was installed at the main entrance and the original door was used for the State Street entrance. The hall was panelled with maple and elaborate mirrored mantels and lighting fixtures were installed. Wide doorways with folding doors were arranged to connect six of the large rooms on the main floor. From the south wall of the front parlor through the wide entrance hall to the north wall of the back parlor was\n*Information gleaned from manuscript, \"The Bee Hive House 1854-1888,\" by Clarissa Young Spencer and her book, One Who Was Valiant, Spencer-Harmer.\na length of 75 feet, making the Bee Hive parlors an ideal place in which to entertain large groups.\nIn 1893, the house became the property of the Latter-day Saint Church and from 1899, was used as the home of the president of the Church. President Lorenzo Snow occupied it for three years. It was President Joseph F. Smith's home for seventeen years. When President Heber J. Grant became president of the Church he decided to remain in his own home on the rim of City Creek Canyon and to allow the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association to use the Bee Hive House as a home for girls who came to the city seeking employment. During the last twenty-three years, thousands of girls have found a real home within the forty-three rooms of this outstanding edifice.\nThe Bee Hive House has had a long useful life. It is dear to the hearts of the members of the Church as one of the few buildings of the pioneer period still standing. The years have but emphasized how well it was built.

Moyle Garden Editor, The Deseret News\nALMOST every amateur gardener, at some time or other during the year, succumbs to that old urge to go out to cut and trim and use the pruning shears on some poor defenseless shrub. It is usually during the early spring that this malady manifests itself; but the pruning shears often become a dangerous weapon in the hands of well-meaning, but misguided plant lovers.\nThousands of helpless plants are not only shorn of their naturally free and graceful form, each year, but often the over-zealous floricultural barber actually cuts away a good part of the year's floral display. Such a calamity is sure to occur when any spring flowering shrub is pruned in early spring, just as it is ready to spread out its yearly show of flowers. The cutting back should be delayed until after the flowers have faded, which is the ideal time to prune most shrubs. By pruning just after the bloom is over, most shrubs will have a full year in which to develop new growth to produce another crop of flowers.\nCorrect pruning has been one of the problems of gardenmakers since the very beginning of gardening. All down the ages, gardeners have had trouble in knowing when, what, and how to trim. Even Shakespeare has given us a slight inkling of how the expert gardeners in the days of King Richard the Second handled the matter. In the scene laid in the garden of the Duke of York, we hear the gardener giving orders to his helper on proper pruning as follows:\nGo bind up yon dangling apricocks Which, like unruly children, make their sire Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight; Go thou, and like an executioner, Cut off the heads of too-fast-growing sprays That look too lofty in our commonwealth: You thus employed, I will go root away The noisesome weeds, that without profit suck The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.\nAll of which is very good advice whether in those far-off times or in our own Victory-garden age. For the continuous good looks and performance of any shrub depends greatly on its being kept in a vital stage of young vigorous wood, and this is only accomplished by pruning, but pruning which should be guided by something more than an urge to trim and cut.\nEach plant presents an individual problem, but the most successful way to keep any woody plant from growing old and full of dead and dying branches is to remove the oldest branches at their base. Cut them away near the soil line or where they sprout from the main branch. This will encourage new branches to grow\nPage 557\n558\nand these will soon become of flowering size and will take the place of the old worn-out portions. Cut the entire branch right down to the bottom so that no old devitalized portion will be left to clutter up the center and prevent the new branches from getting air and sun. Unpruned plants soon become crowded in the center and even the new wood cannot grow or bloom well when it is so crowded.\nAlthough the different shrubs vary in their growing habits, most of the common fast growing kinds such as forsythia, flowering almond, philadelphus, syringea and spirea all need this attention at least every other year, and as much as one-third of the old wood may be cut out with good results. Slower growing shrubs need less frequent and less drastic pruning, but even lilacs are improved and made to bloom better by occasionally removing the oldest branches in order to keep them flowering well.\nIn addition, all crooked branches, and any that grow toward the center and interfere with other branches, and also any poor weak ones should be cut entirely away at their base. It is best to merely shorten too-long branches. Thus the natural form and habit of the plant are retained, and, at the same time, new growth is encouraged. How different is the usual method of treating the poor defenseless shrub, cutting back all branches, young and old. So that the poor thing bristles like some angry pincushion. Such pruning merely adds trouble, for soon the plant is so crowded with dead and weak branches that it cannot flower well, and its very appearance is negligible.\nSuperfluous branches We lop away that bearing boughs may live.\nSo says Shakespeare's gardener, and he then ruminates on the state of affairs of government under the improvident King, comparing the troubled times with a badly managed garden\n... Oh! What a pity is it That he had not so dressed and trimmed his land As we this garden!\nAnd so it goes to this very day, management of both government and garden must be good, if either is to prosper well.\nTake the method of using the shears, for instance; the cut should always be slanting and done cleanly so that the fibers of the plant are not torn and ragged. And no stump should be left on any plant, shrub or tree to invite disease and decay. Such stumps are a menace and eventually bring decay into the good parts of the plant. Cut away clean at the main branch so that new bark can grow and heal the cut over.\nWITH roses, it is the pruning which determines the size and beauty of the flower as much as any one thing. No bush of any hybrid tea rose can produce lovely flowers if it is choked with a forest of superfluous branches. The center of the rose plant must be maintained free from weak and over-crowded stems. Clip all except the strongest branches completely away at their base, and keep the development of your rose plant in mind even when cutting roses. Cut the blooms with a long stem, leaving two or three leaves on the stem, and by all means make the\nPRUNING RULES TO MAKE YOUR GARDEN GROW\ncut just above a leaf or bud which grows out, instead of in toward the center, for the new branch which will soon begin wherever a cut is made, will grow in the direction that this leaf or bud points. By all means keep the center of rose plants open to allow air and sun to circulate and so keep them in good health.\nThere are several different types of climbing roses, each one demanding a different kind of pruning. The climbers that produce clusters of small roses and that bloom only once during the year, such as the Dorothy Perkins and the American Beauty rose, are best pruned just after the blooming season is over. New branches will already be found growing from the base of the plant, and the old canes that have just borne a crop of flowers should be cut away at their base, thus making way for new branches to grow. Almost all other climbers need only to have the very old and dead wood cut away occasionally.\nThose fine new everblooming hybrid tea climbers which produce an astonishing burden of large and lovely roses need only to have the faded blooms\n559\nclipped away. This encourages another crop of flowers, so it should not be neglected. The branches themselves need little pruning.\nLarge flowered climbers such as Dr. Van Fleet, that exquisite pale pink rose, need little or no pruning except the cutting away of dead branches. Occasionally a branch will die out, and this should be removed as soon in the spring as the foliage is all well out and one can tell for sure whether the branch is dead. But all too often we have a cold winter which does a thorough job of killing the top growth, and thus our plants must begin again to make entirely new wood.\nEvergreens need occasional trimming to keep any too-lush branches from spoiling their appearance, and certain of the tall junipers should be trimmed twice each year to make their growth more dense and stronger. They will be able to withstand snow and wind better if pruned, for the growth will be thicker and more velvety. Only the outer tip of the branches should be cut away. The best time for this work on junipers is April and late August.\n\nDixie Pioneers\n(Continued from page 549)\ndanced on the salt grass for their first Christmas celebration, where the old Liberty Pole was placed, or where the \"Big House\" stood. They conquered because they knew what they needed and they knew how to get it. They had a unity of purpose that carried them through.\nIn our generation we must conquer mental obstacles. It may be a more difficult problem. Let us pray that we may succeed as well as they.\n\nTomorrow's Cup\nAnna Prince Redd\nChapter VI\nSynopsis: Janet, protectingly reared in Washington, D. C., lives in constant dread of the San Juan country of Utah where her husband, Paul Morgan, has an Indian trading post on the mesa. She plans on their moving to Washington before the birth of her baby, but does not disclose this intention to her husband. Upon returning home with Paul after a happy week spent on the mesa, they find that Janet's sister, Rhae, and her husband, Warren Newsbaum, have arrived for a short visit with the announced intention of taking Janet back to Washington with them. The next morning Paul is hurt when he saves Warren from being dragged by a broncho. A few months later, while Paul, restored to health, is absent on a roundup, an Indian, Mike, threatens to kill Janet. She seeks refuge in the Devil's Corridor where she becomes unconscious. During the long days that follow, Janet lies in an unconscious condition, and when her child is born it lives only a few hours. After its birth, however, she falls into a natural sleep.\nJack came into the store the back way, unobserved, just as Paul brushed a litter of papers aside and sank tiredly into his desk chair. It was the first time she had been to see him at his work since her illness months before. All day she had watched the Indians string in and out of the store, knowing that Paul would be worn from their bargaining, longing to go and help him as she had always done, but afraid to intrude on what seemed to be more and more his own domain. She had been encased in her own grief so long that it was hard to break free. She was shocked to realize how long\nPage 560\nit had been since she and Paul had felt the old, carefree companionship with each other. A year ago she would have been in the store with Paul, bargaining with the shrewdest of them. No Indian ever sold a blanket at the first figure set for it. Janet smiled in spite of herself. Many a time she'd driven a better bargain than Paul had succeeded in doing. It made her want to get in and swap bargains until Paul would catch her up in his big arms and say they'd made enough money for one day, it was time for \"chow.\"\nBut the day had worn wearily away and she had not gone near the store. \"Paul should be coming in to dinner,\" had been her last thought, and as he was making no effort to drive the loiterers out so he could lock up, she suddenly was on her way to see that he did. But her first sight of him, unconscious of her presence, made her feel shy and awkward.\nAs Paul sank into his chair, relaxing his long body, his face looked drawn and tired. Janet hesitated, standing out of sight behind a barrel of cured meats. The store had emptied itself of the last straggler and there seemed nothing for her to do, now that she was here. She turned to leave, and just then the front door opened, directly in line with her path of retreat. Paul looked up without curiosity, for one more to come and go was\nTOMORROW'S CUP\nall in a day to him. He showed no interest whatever, even when he saw that the man in the door was Doctor Potsworth.\nThe doctor came in. \"How are you, Paul?\" he asked gravely.\n\"Oh, fine,\" Paul replied, but his voice belied his words.\nJanet was shocked by his lack of interest. His enthusiasm for everything in life had been one of his main attractions for her. She turned to slip quietly away, when Paul's voice stopped her.\n\"Glad to see you, Doc,\" Paul was saying. \"Janet's over at the house.\"\nJanet drew back guiltily.\n\"I didn't come to see Janet,\" Potsworth said bluntly. \"I came to see you. I saw Janet yesterdayin town.\"\nJanet hung on Paul's answer. She had gone to town without telling him that she was going, hardly knowing why, herself. Certainly she hadn't intended buying that railroad ticket. It would be Doctor Potsworth who would come in and see her doing it. Of course she hadn't explained. There wasn't anything she could say about it. Now what would Paul say?\nHe said evenly: \"Yes, I believe Janet was in town.\"\nJanet was disappointed without knowing why. She had vaguely hoped Paul would deny that she had been away without his knowledge. His next words shocked her almost into betraying her presence.\n\"Janet's planning a vacation, Doc. A long vacation.\"\nHis voice was so controlled that it was emotionless. He almost recited the words.\n\"Feeling dull, eh?\" Dr. Potsworth asked.\nPaul leaped to his feet. \"Can I help it if she's sick of the place? I\n561\nam, too! We're as far from each other as El Toro is from civilization!\"\nJANET turned and ran out of the store, her heart hammering out his words. Paul was sick of El Toro! Now they would go away! At first that was her one clear thought. She went past a cowboy chopping wood in the shade of the red cliffs back of the house. Past Juanee making moccasins for her boys. Past old Taos' kennel, where now an upstart collie yelped for attention. She spurned him with her foot. Old Taos was dead. El Toro was dead. Fear was dead! Her heart sang with relief. Paul was sick of El Toro! Soon all this would be only a bitter memory. There'd be a new life; new friends and old ones. Her heels made ecstatic little sounds on the hollow stones of the patio. A new life! No Devil's Corridor under her feet. No mummy case at her back. No Indians to stalk her dreams. No reproachful squaw to worry about. When she and Paul were gone, Indian Joe would come back to Juanee again and stop hunting foolish old Mike and his bad begay. Juanee's twin boys ran around the house chasing a phantom deer, bows taut, arrows aimed. Janet's eyes followed them.... No laughing-eyed boys to peer at her through the screen, waiting for cookies.... Eyes that reproached her when she did not smile. Eyes that looked at her curiously as they were doing now from behind the corner of the porch.\nJanet gave each of the boys a handful of cakes, hardly conscious that her thought train had been broken. She'd send the boys presents. Strange\n562\nthings they had never seen. Things that would make their eyes pop out of their heads. Things that would hold their curiosity for days on end. (They were so much a part of her life that her new plans could not go on without them.)\nAway ran the twins twanging their arrows, laughing back at Janet. Her thoughts went as swiftly on their own way. There'd be her father, fusty and dear in his museum; Rhae and Warren and all their friends. Her old home; all the dear familiar things she'd known and left. Paul would see. Their life would be so gay and beautiful he'd forget his enslavement here. Paul would forget to frown; his laugh would ring out at little things as it had when she first knew him. Paul would not have to be scolded by a fat old doctor who took upon himself the spiritual as well as the physical welfare of his patients. Paul would be a figure of respect in his new world. He'd be doing\nWhat would Paul be doing? Try as she would, she could not make Paul's image come alive in any surroundings other than his own. Taken from El Toroeven in her thoughtshe became unreal and elusive.\nJanet shook her head as if to clear her mind of this unwelcome thought, and to restore the gay visions she had conjured up; but they refused to be conjured. Sitting straight in a chair by the door, she listened, as if she could still hear Paul and the doctor talking. Paul, idly sketching Indian heads on his desk pad, or jumping up angrily to deny the doctor's words. Doc, scolding and nagging at him, reminding him of his duty to his wife.\nJanet locked and unlocked her fingers. Why should she care what they were saying? What anyone said? She was free now. Free to leave El Toro! But Paul's words persisted in her ears.... \"We're as far from each other as El Toro from civilization....\" Paul's eyes, sick with misery, still defied her to hurt him any more.\nSlowly realization came. Paul was not sick of El Toro. Paul loved his country and his home with all his heart. But he was unhappy. Hurt from loneliness and her withdrawal into her own grief. Unhappy because of the tiny grave upon the hill, just as she was. Unconsciously she had blamed Paul for that. And for many, many other things. Though her grief had softened, her bitterness remained, including Paul, the good little doctor, El Toro, San Juan, and herself in its dregs. The dregs of selfish, unshared grief; pain that denied healing.\nHow could she have become so absorbed as not to have seen the pain in Paul's eyes, in his voice? How far they were from the quiet happiness of their camp on Gray Mesa. From the fire-glow and the stars above Hotel Collins. And how many, many bitter times she had remembered. \"This week is something to remember, Janet,\" Paul had said as they rode down from the mesa. \"Something we may both wish for in the days to come.\" Paul's voice then... Paul's voice now.... On the mesa, in the store, dull with misery.\nJanet sprang up, anger at Paul, at Dr. Potsworth, at herself, at the country, being broken to bits by the hammering of her heart. Suffocating with the force of\nTOMORROW'S CUP\nit, she went out into the patio. The sun was setting on the little cemetery she had never seen. She knew only by Juanee's sad gaze that her baby was there. Janet smiled and climbed the hill. Realization had not come too late.\n\"PAUL, won't you take Dr. Potsworth's advice and let what's done be done? Leave Mike and his begay alone and let them come back?\"\nJanet and Paul were sitting together in the west patio. Night had fallen in quiet beauty. Heavy with perfume, the desert air clung about them. There wasn't the least riffle of a breeze, no sound to break the stillness but their own intermittent voices.\n\"It's been months, Paul,\" Janet continued, \"since Mike tore up the place. Yet you trail him ceaselessly. Juanee worries about Joe, lying in wait for Mike to slip back into the reservation. You both know the Utes will never let you take Mike without a fight. There's been too much trouble in this country already, too much bloodshed. Give this fight up, Paul.\"\nPaul's hand closed reassuringly over Janet's. \"Why didn't you tell me you were afraid,\" he said. \"I'd have gone to the ends of the earth with you. It was left for Doc to set me straight. I blame myself for what happened to you. I'll take you away, and come back here only to do the things I have to do.\"\n\"Like hunting savages.\"\n\"But, Janet dear, acts like Mike's can't continue. The Indians think we're afraid to fight. This time they'll not get off!\"\n563\n\"Then you give me just one more thing to fear.\"\n\"Let me take you away, Janet?\"\n\"No, Paul. If you had hunted for a way to bind me to El Toro you could not have found a surer one.\"\nPaul noted with satisfaction that there was no bitterness in Janet's voice. He even fancied it held a bit of relief. He lifted her hand and spread each of her tapered, beautiful fingers over one of his own, measuring his thought to fit his words.\n\"Youyou meanthat fear for me overmasters your fear of the country?\"\nJanet nodded. \"There can be no choice,\" she said simply.\n\"Your happiness is all I want,\" Paul said gratefully. \"If it will help things for you, I'll try to get Mike out of my system. Now that we're together again nothing else matters.\"\nJanet laughed shakily. \"You sound as if I'd been gone for years, Paul. Actually. Not just into my moody self.\"\n\"Ages,\" Paul corrected. \"Years couldn't be that long. Don't ever leave me alone again, Janet. We belong together. If not here, then\"\n\"Here. Paul.\" Janet said it determinedly.\n\"IT'S good to see you smile again, Juanee.\"\nJanet had turned from her baking to greet the young Indian woman as she came in at the back door, grinning broadly.\n\"Now that my Joe is back I sing all day,\" Juanee told her. \"And my mother, she is coming today... Five months she has been gone.\"\n\"Yes. Ever since the day Mike's begay tricked you away from El Toro. Will your mother tell us what happened to her at her hogan? How\n564\nthe begay got her turquoise cross?\"\n\"If my father is not angry, my mother will talk.\" Juanee's black eyes flashed angrily; her proud little shoulders came up in defiance.\n\"But your father brought Mike back to the reservation\"\n\"Tied to the tail of his horse!\" Juanee interrupted. \"His honor is restored.\"\n\"Yes, Juanee. And Mike has promised to be a good Indian. Your father did well to let the sheriff take Mike to jail. That will help him to be a good Indian. Your father will not be angry now?\"\n\"My father is just. He is a chief. He is proud.\"\n\"Mike is a foolish old man. His boy is bad because he has a bad father. Mike promises that the boy shall live with his grandmother and go to school. His grandmother is a good woman. So now everything is settled, Juanee, and you are happy again.\"\n\"You, too, Miss Janet? All the time you make me think of a velvet yucca, white and tall.\"\n\"Why, Juanee, that was a lovely compliment.\"\n\"But you should be pinklike the cactus blossom.\"\n\"When I come back from Washington, D. C., you won't know me, Juanee,\" Janet announced unexpectedly.\n\"You are going away?\" There was worry in Juanee's eyes.\n\"Yes, Juanee.\" Janet was surprised at the way she went on announcing a half-formed plan. She had said she would not leave El Toro, but knowing that Mike was safely lodged in jail had suddenly released her tension. She could go away now for awhile and be happy.\n\"And Mister Paul?\" Juanee asked, reproaching Janet with every inch of her slim, loyal little body.\n\"He is going to Washington too. Not now, but very soon.\"\nJuanee's satisfaction was complete. \"That is good,\" she said. \"When you come to El Toro again there will be another papoose in my hogan.\"\nJanet cried: \"Juanee! That's wonderful!\"\nBut her heart contracted with envy.\n\"Do not be sad, Miss Janet,\" Juanee was quick to catch the meaning of Janet's eyes. \"Every night I pray to the Father of my people. That is why I have another papoose. Now, when my boys are six years old.\"\n\"And you think I should pray to the Father of my people?\"\n\"If you want baby, yes.\"\nJanet's eyes turned to the little grave upon the hill, framed within the big new window Paul had added to El Toro. \"I have prayed, Juanee. Very, very hard.\"\n\"Then you get baby.\" Juanee's white teeth flashed through a broad smile. \"I'll go now and bake potatoes in the ashes.\"\nWhenever Juanee wanted to celebrate she baked potatoes in the ashes.\n\"That's a very good custom,\" Janet said, and Juanee went out.\n\"Dear God,\" Janet prayed silently. \"Let me want to bake potatoes in the ashes too!\"\n(To be continued)"

            "content": "Dixie Pioneers Florence Ivins Hyde MOST stories of pioneer life depict the conquering of a wilderness by men and women who trekked through snows, forded treacherous rivers, climbed mountainsides, ate the dust of the desert, fought starvation, and drank the brackish waters of new lands, and, for the most part, they never turned back. We sometimes wonder, why they didn't. The Dixie pioneers of Utah were no exception to the rule. In the ride between Salt Lake City and St. George, as one drinks in the beauty of the peach and cherry blossoms, the rock formations, unsurpassed in coloring, it is difficult to realize the sacrifice that went into the roads that make this pleasure possible. Only a few years ago there were no roads. They had to be made as the people went along, and only the stout of heart could survive the difficulties. Still, their pioneer life was not all tragedy. There was some romance and some humor, but these were the \"purple patches\" of their lives. For 'the most part, their way was long and weary, and life was a constant struggle. Perhaps the women of this group felt the hardships the most. They saw their husbands grow old before their time. They watched their children die young, and there were times when they heard their children cry for food. But through it all they stood by their men. One woman has said that more than once she had decided to \"'set her husband up\" for taking them into such an undesirable place, but when he would come home at night, he \"looked so tired she hadn't the heart.\" The life experiences of my own grandparents and parents are typical of a class among the Mormons of that time. They hardly became settled in one place before they were called to settle a new place: always trying to make something from nothing. To us who live in this world of ultra-sophistication, the stories of this pioneer life appear like the grimmest reality. In those early days the journey from Salt Lake to St. George, which now can be made in eight hours, required four weeks. Each night the tents had to be pitched, beds made down, and food cooked. Occasionally it became necessary to \"lay over\" a day to wash clothes and bake bread, which had to be done in a small bake skillet. Sometimes they were delayed because their horses and oxen sank in the mud, and it was with great difficulty that they were rescued. In certain places quicksand was encountered from which the animals were never recovered. In case of a storm they must spend a day drying their bedding over the bushes. Journeying farther South, the sun grew hot, the wind dry, dust and sand and more dust and sand, but through it all they journeyed on. Some of those original pioneers were men and women who had known the comforts that comparative wealth can give. A Page 545 546 few were of the type who could never take root in new soil, but, on the whole, these Dixie pioneers never questioned the wisdom of their choice in following the command of their leaders. As they prepared for their journey into the South in 1861, their instructions were to \"travel light.\" 'Their leader, Erastus Snow, my grandfather, said to them: I do not feel that it will be wisdom for us to load ourselves down with household furniture, but if a woman wishes to take her rocking chair along, let her take it, for that will probably make her more comfortable than any other article of furniture. I wish our brethren to supply themselves with tools to work in the ground, such as spades, shovels, picks, etc. We can find plenty of timber for making bedsteads and other articles of furniture. He asked to have a carding machine taken, as well as any musical instruments, music books or school books that the people could collect. Their instructions were to locate at the junction of the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers, and by the time they reached Black Volcanic Ridge, it was apparent that they had a difficult problem to solve. It was here that they unloaded and dismantled their wagons, letting them down over the cliffs, one part after another. It was here, too, that the wife of Johnny Pym, an English convert, gave birth to a child. Both the mother and child were let down over the ridge. One wonders how these pioneers endured those first hard years in southern Utah. For thirty years they fought the elements, before they finally subdued them. Their crops dried up because no rain came in time, or too much rain brought floods which destroyed their dams. But when these dams went out, others were built. At one time it rained forty days. Rivers and creeks overflowed their banks carrying along barns, homes, furniture, even men, women, and children, some of whom were never rescued. But Erastus Snow's motto was, \"Remain and conquer.\" He said: Never travel without a shovel no matter where you go. And if you see a rock that should be removed, remove it, and if you see a low place that needs to be filled, get out and throw in some dirt. Hardly were their tents pitched before they laid their plans for a permanent settlement with houses, corrals, and fences. My grandfather, Israel Ivins, had surveyed the land so that the allotments could be made. Men were sent to scout out a road into the mountains in order to obtain wood, cedar, and pine, for furniture. Every male over fourteen years of age was required to work three days each year in improving roads. All kinds of artisans had been called to Dixie by Brigham Young, masons, blacksmiths, painters, plasterers, and carpenters. One man they called '\"\"Chairmaker Bleak,\" who was an artist in his line. The beds were four-poster beds with rope springs, on which were laid straw or cornhusk mattresses, or if a family was lucky, a feather bed. Chairs were built with rawhide seats. The people lived in tents and wagons, often sleeping in beds wet by the rain. If the sun shone next day, the bedding was hung on bushes to dry. These tents were called Sibleytents and were round, with two doors opposite each other. As time went DIXIE PIONEERS 547 ERASTUS SNOW, LEADER OF THE DIXIE PIONEERS, AND ELIZABETH ASHBY SNOW, HIS WIFE, WITH THEIR FIRST CHILD, ELIZABETH SNOW (MRS. ANTHONY W. IVINS) on, Grandfather Snow found it necessary to build a little room back of one door for an extra bedroom. That winter President Young came down and occupied that room. Mother tells of being awakened in the night by a terrific wind, and seeing grandma standing in the middle of the tent holding up the pole, while grandfather drove deeper the stakes that held the ten. This tent room served as living room, dining room, and bedroom. In summer, the family cooked, washed, ironed, and ate outside in a bowery covered with grapevines. Often, just at meal time, a strong wind would come up, filling the food with sand.  DURING these early years the mail came through only once in several weeks. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the war news came on strips of paper of different colors, about eight inches wide and one yard long. They were called telegrams. Grandfather Snow subscribed for these telegrams, and when they arrived, the men would come together in his tent where the news was read by Brother Bleak, who \"was-a very good reader.\" The struggle which took so much from the people physically, developed their resourcefulness, and they really enjoyed solving many of their problems. When they first arrived, their children's dresses were made from wagon covers colored with dye made from \"dockroot,\" logwood, and blueing. In dyeing wool, if they wanted it variegated in color, strings 548 were tied tightly around the yarn at intervals. Until a woolen factory was established in the nearby town of Washington, the mothers spun the yarn and wove it into cloth for their children's clothes, or they learned to make over dresses from used ones sent them by relatives in faraway places. As they became more prosperous, the little girls wore red flannel skirts and white blouses called \"posies,\" blouses with little peplums. Caps for the children were made of numerous layers of paper pasted together and shaped over a little brass kettle, then covered with bits of cloth. Hats for men were made from the gleanings from the wheat fields. My grandmother would braid and sew a man's hat in one day and sell it for five dollars to the gold seekers who passed on their way to California. She would, also, make by hand, in one day, a man's stiff shirt with a tucked bosom, which she would sell for seven dollars. For the first few years, the most serious problem was that of food, which was so scarce the people rarely had enough to eat. The few cows in * the town were called for in the morning by boys who took them into the hills where there was a little grass, and who brought them back at night. Sometimes the children had to wait a long time for the cow to come, and when she did come, they often got \"no more than a teacupful of milk apiece.\" Sometimes the cow strayed away and did not get home at all, and the children went to bed hungry. Breakfast consisted of corn bread and bran coffee, and supper of cornmeal mush. Later, after the flour mill was built, they had griddle cakes made of biscuit dough rolled thin and fried in butter. The hot summers made it almost impossible to keep food palatable. Milk would not keep sweet from morning until night. The butter would melt, the water was warm. All the housewife could do to cool the water was to wrap the water barrel in a wet blanket or carpet. The family dipper always hung on the side of the barrel. Occasionally, relatives from Salt Lake would send a few dried beans or apples. Always. Tucked away in the sack would be found a box of needles or pins, or a spool of thread. The first store was established by men from California, in the basement of the Snow house, called the \"Big House.\" The men were boarded by my grandmother who lived upstairs. When Christmas came, they wished to make her a \"nice\" present, so gave her the \"makings of a rice puddingtrice, eggs, and raisins\"; she furnished the milk. FROM the very beginning these pioneers tried to have a school, even while they lived in tents. Sister Everett and later Sister Snell taught the children to read. My father tells about the boys crawling under the sides of the school tent and running away. \"But,\" he says, \"the girls never ran away.\" The great teacher of the time was Richard Horne. He did for these little children of Dixie what Karl G., Maeser did for the adults of the Church. These early days produced some unique characters, one of whom was \"Aunt Mary Gates,\" a sister of Erastus Snow and wife of Jacob Gates. She had no children of her own, but DIXIE PIONEERS gathered the children of the town around her, and taught them Greek and Roman history, and even astronomy, which she tried to explain by using apples and sometimes oranges for the planets. She developed a unique philosophy. She would declare: Why dress children up and then scold them if they get dirty?... Why iron sheets in hot weather? Why not fold them up and sit on them? It is a great accomplishment to know what to slight.... When a person cooks one chicken for fifteen people, she should make plenty of gravy. No small problem was that of the pioneers' relationship with the Indians, who resented the coming of the white man and on several occasions waylaid travelers and murdered them. Grandfather's method of dealing with them was similar to that of Brigham Young's. When Indians came into St. George in crowds, he would kill a beef and divide it among them. He largely solved the Indian problem, for no one, with the exception of Jacob Hamblin, had greater influence with them. At one time when they were boys, my father and Uncle Willard Snow did not return from a rabbit hunt. Jacob Hamblin went with a group to hunt for them, finding them prisoners at an Indian camp. When he told the Indians that one boy was a son of Erastus Snow, they immediately released them. Old Mokiac was a patriarch, the chief of the Piutes. He had two sons, Mokiac and Limpy, who was crippled. Both were \"mean.\" One day Mokiac appeared at President Snow's home and asked his wife for food. She gave him meat, and bread and butter. Then he demanded tea. She 549 said she had none, whereupon he pulled out his knife and flourished it about to frighten her. Fortunately, her son walked in and the Indian left; but Erastus Snow demanded of Old Mokiac that his son be punished, not by the whites, but by the Indians themselves. He was brought into the town by them and tied to the Liberty Pole where his father whipped him with a black whip, while the people looked on. AS the years passed by, the people began to have more conveniences and could think more of parties, of dramatics, and various types of entertainment. But many of the men who had helped to make this entertainment possible, never lived to see that day. At one time Erastus Snow reported to the Authorities of the Church that they had thirty or forty young widows who would have to rear their families alone. One man who had been \"called\" refused to stay, saying he would not give up his farm up north for the whole of southern Utah. Brother Adams, the poet laureate, wrote a song about it for one of the gatherings, wherein he sang, \"He measured Mormon Dixie by the breadth of his thumbnail.\" Those pioneers of Dixie conquered the wilderness as other pioneers have done. It was a physical struggle to conquer physical obstacles. That strange mysterious thing which prompts men and women to answer the call of duty buoyed them up. They did not want pity nor ask for glory. They left their sons and daughters as a monument to their lives. Many places in the town today have stories behind themwhere they (Continued on page 559) Chastity The following statements are reprinted herewith because of the vital present-day need for the message which they contain: President Joseph F. Smith soTHERE are at least three dangers that threaten the Church within.... As I see these they are the flattery of prominent men in the world, false educational ideas, and sexual impurity. \"But the third subject mentionedpersonal purity, is perhaps of greater importance than either of the other two. We believe in one: standard of morality for men and women. If purity of life is neglected, all other dangers set in upon us like the rivers of waters when the flood gates are opened.\" Gospel Doctrine, pp. 391-392. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. CHASTITY is fundamental to our life and to our civilization. If the race becomes unchaste, it will perish. Immorality has been basic to the destruction of mighty nations in the past. It will bring to dust the mighty nations of the present. ) \"Fyvery one of us who instructs our youth, in whatever place or position, and in whatever capacity, must teach the young people of today to abstain from unchastity. We must surround our teachings with due and proper reserve and modesty. We must approach and teach the youth as the children of God, with spirits that are to live throughout eternity, and tell them plainly and clearly that the laws of God, and of man also, demand that they live chaste. If we shall teach anything less than this, we will destroy our youth and we will bring ourselves under a condemnation which is too great to be fathomed by the human mind. \"In what I have said I include all of us parents. How can we parents face our Maker if we have failed in one featherweight to meet the duty which is ours in these matters? And let us not make the mistakeany of usof assuming that our children are beyond temptation and may not fall. This is a delusion and a snare that will bring us to the very depths. Let every father and every mother, every brother and every sister, stand guard day and night that their loved ones be not seized and carried away by lust. \"You young people, may I directly entreat you to be chaste. Please believe me when I say that chastity is worth more than life itself. This is the doctrine my parents taught me; it is truth. Better die chaste than live unchaste. The salvation of your very soul is concerned in this.\"From an address delivered at the 109th Semi-annual Conference. Page 550"

Dustin\nYOUTH\nThe lanky brown arms of a seedling tree One morning pulled her head above the ground, And tried to stretch up straight that she might see Above the dove-gray sage that stood around And formed a beard upon earth's dormant length. She saw earth's beveled hem all dipped in snow That shadowed her with its great tow'ring strength Where evergreens were filed in row on row. She watched the light of day hide in the West Where it drenched moody earth in colored streaks; And redmen drawing near, as brightly dressed, Were stretching rawhides into tepee peaks. The nights were pinned with stars, and moons passed by And framed a seedling tree against the sky.\nMATURITY\nThose lanky arms grew strong and firm and round, Her tousled hair was brushed out by the wind, And when she wore night's shadow-lace she found The glist'ning Evening Star the night had pinned Above her ear; she stood with dignity, And could be seen across the valley's breast. One day a pilgrim band found this lone tree, And stopped their rattling, white-top train to rest. She watched them as they bared earth's virgin loam, And heard them plan a city at her feet. And as they built each log and earth-patched home That faced the squares where wheels scarred up each street, New caravans met there beneath her shade, Where hands were clasped and new friendships were made.\nOLD AGE\nA canopy now frames her wrinkled face As she looks out on Emigration Street; In summer, poplars drape fine shadowed lace Into a shawl that wraps her head and feet. And high above she hears the drone of wings; She watches horseless buggies speeding by; She's in a new world now of pulsing things, But sees the same blue canvas stretched on high Whereon the Master Artist paints each day From His rich bowl of gold the moon and stars; And shakes bright dust along the Milky Way, And then with raindrops arches pastel bars. This fine old cedar who is stooped with age Has watched a city spring from dusty sage!\nPage 565\n\nNew General Presidency Of The Primary Association\n(Continued from page 532)\na native of Salt Lake City and a daughter of George M.

The president,\nBelle Johnson, is in the center, with her counselors, Belle McAllister and Hettie Bent on either side. Than one hundred ward members participated as members of the cast, in the Singing Mothers' chorus, in a male quartette, and in other musical numbers. In eight scenes, the pageant depicted the organization, growth, and activities of the Relief Society during its 101 years. The accompanying picture shows a part of the scene, \"The Trek Across the Plains.\" There was much enthusiasm shown and it is felt that working together on this venture brought about greater unity and cooperation in the ward as well as in the Society. Carbon Stake (Utah) BELLE JOHNSON, Carbon Stake Relief Society president, and Estella McIntire, membership coordinator, report that a special program of recognition of the accomplishments of the wards of this stake during the four-year membership-building program was held in connection with the Relief Society session of the stake quarterly conference during the summer of 1942. The part of the program which was devoted to the recognition of achievements and presentation of awards was carried out in thyme. The report continues: The Singing Mothers and other music were under the direction of Stake Chorister Mary Hansen. The talk suggested in the program outlined by the General Board was given by Counselor Belle McAllister, and the scriptural reading, with music, by Assistant Secretary Ardes McQueen. President Belle Johnson gave the president's report and the rest of the time was given to the recognitions and awards. The hall was decorated in white roses and baby breath. Two arches made of white flowers were placed over the pulpit, forming a beautiful canopy for those taking part. There was a part on the program for. Each of the stake board members and also for those being honored.  NOTES FROM THE FIELD 571 THE RIGBY STAKE RELIEF SOCIETY Planting an American weeping beech tree on the grounds of the new Idaho Falls Temple, April 24, 1943Awards were made to Mabel Livingstone of the Third Ward Relief Society for the best Relief Society scrapbook in the stake; to Junie Allred, also of the Third Ward.

Two little girls dressed in blue and gold carried the certificates of award in daintily decorated baskets to the honored ones. This was followed by a candle-lighting ceremony which was one of the highlights of the program. The stake scrapbook was a work of art and was on display during and after the program for the benefit of the congregation. The program was planned by the stake board and written up in rhyme by Assistant Secretary Ardes McQueen. Rigby Stake (Idaho) STELLA F. BROSSARD, Relief Society stake secretary-treasurer submitted the following report of the tree-planting ceremony held by the Rigby Stake Relief Society, which planted a tree on the grounds of the new Idaho Falls Temple: The tree-planting ceremony of the Rigby Stake Relief Society was held Saturday, April 24, 1943, at 4:00 p. M. On the Latter-day Saint Temple grounds at Idaho Falls, Idaho. The tree, donated to the Temple grounds by the Rigby Stake Relief Society, is an American weeping beech. Forty persons were present at the ceremony, including Elders H. T. Moss and O. S. Cordon, formerly of the Rigby Stake presidency; Elder Lyman J. Ball, high councilman who is Relief Society advisor; the former Relief Society stake president, Lettie E. Call; and Elder Robert F. Woller, temple gardener. President Phoebe Cordon presided.

VISITING TEACHERS OF THE RICHFIELD THIRD WARD, SEVIER STAKE, Who achieved a record of 100 per cent visiting teaching during 1941-42. Vocal trio composed of Geneva Snow, Sylvia Jones, and Mabel Fillmore sang Joyce Kilmer's poem, \"Trees.'\"' The dedicatory prayer was offered by Elder H. T. Moss. Sevier Stake (Utah) THE Sevier Stake Relief Society submitted the following report of an entertainment for the visiting teachers of the Richfield Third Ward held in July 1942: Under the leadership of the ward Relief Society president, Georgia Ogden, and her counselors, Myrtle Curtis and Ruby Nielson, a unique entertainment was given for the visiting teachers of the Richfield Third Ward. Sister Curtis was in direct charge of the arrangements. 'Thirty-four of the thirty-eight visiting teachers were in attendance. Sisters Myrl Brugger, Sevier Stake Relief Society president, and Martha Hunt, stake leader of visiting teachers, were present by special invitation. The entertainment was given in appreciation for the fine work done by the visiting teachers of this ward, who achieved a record of 100 per cent visiting for the year. A telephone conversation carried on by the ward president, seated at one end of the table with Everdena Winkel, ward sponsor at the other end, explained the purpose of the entertainment, presented the high ideals and standards of Relief Society work, and expressed appreciation of the willing and efficient work that had been carried on by: the ward visiting teachers. Another feature of the entertainment was the spelling of the word TEACHER, each assigned member giving her own interpretation and meaning of each letter in regard to the visiting teachers' work. The contributions offered on this part of the program were original and varied in form and length. Light refreshments, singing, and games added much to the entertainment of the afternoon. Liberty Stake (Utah) EDNA P. PULHAM, secretary treasurer of Liberty Stake Relief Society, submitted the following report: The Liberty Stake Relief Society Board entertained the ward presidencies at a delightful luncheon, Thursday, September 17, 1942, in the Lion House. The occasion was in the nature of a fall festival, expressing gratitude for the bounties of life. In keeping with this idea, the tables were  NOTES FROM THE FIELD 573 RELIEF SOCIETY OF LA GRANDE FIRST WARD, UNION STAKE (OREGON) TAKEN AT CLOSING SOCIAL, MAY 26, 1942 Seated directly behind the basket of flowers at the right is Viola Fullmer, with her counselors, Julia Decker and Katie Weimer on either side. Seated at the extreme right is Mina Larson, who preceded Sister Fullmer as president, and seated at the extreme left is Edith Stoddard, who served for many years as president of this ward Relief Society.

Beautifully decorated with fruits and vegetables cut in numerous patterns, depicting stars and flowers. Each plate was marked with a place card, and a nosegay consisting of radish rosebuds and green parsley, with a paper lace background tied with red ribbon. The master centerpiece consisted of a huge basket of fruit. On each end of the table was a large bowl of endive, on which vegetables, cut in various shapes to represent flowers, were arranged. These unique decorations were the work of a decoration committee of which Gardie Standing, stake board member, was chairman. Stake Relief Society President Emma G. Phillips presided. The program was opened by the group singing \"One Hundred Thousand Strong,\" under the leadership of Stake Chorister Margaret Stockman and Stake Organist Agnes Duffin. The invocation was by Louise H. Weilenmann, president of the Liberty Ward. After an address of welcome by Gertrude R. Michelsen of the stake presidency, the time was turned over to our capable toastmistress, Diana R. Lambert, a board member. [Since that time, Sister Lambert has succeeded Sister Michelsen as counselor. The harvest idea was also carried out in the toasts which were as follows: \"The PeachOur Heritage,\" by Mildred P. Elggren, a member of the stake presidency; \"The PearOur Responsibility as Mothers of the Home Front,\" by Lillie B. Forsgren, president of the Harvard Ward; \"WheatOur Achievements of Yesterday,\" by Elda D. Miller, president of the Third Ward; \"The AppleOur Pledge to the Future,\" by Reta T.

The missionaries and branch Priesthood members enjoyed a softball game before the picnic lunch. The accompanying picture of the Relief Society members was taken at this outing. We have all enjoyed in \"Notes From the Field\" the pictures of our friends in the wards and stakes at home, and hope some $75 of them will still remember those of us who have been in the mission fields many years, but: still call Utah \"Home.\" JEANETTE LANDERMAN, secretary of the Corpus Christi Branch Relief Society, reports: The Corpus Christi Branch Relief Society held its first bazaar Saturday evening, December 12, 1942. A chicken dinner was served; a fine program of songs, dances, and oratory was presented; and various games and dancing made the evening complete. Weare all ready to begin on articles for our 1943 bazaar. We have a beautiful spirit of love, charity, faith, and toil among our sisters here. SO YOUNG A BRIDE Anna Prince Redd So young a bride!

Sheology Articles of Faith Lesson 19  Zion Tuesday, December 7, 1943 (This is the third chapter dealing with Article 10) Article 10\"\"We believe... Continent, * * *\" that Zion will be built upon this (the American) Lesson Aim: To show that the work of the Lord will cover the whole earth, and two capitals-will be established, one on the eastern and one on the western hemisphere, both of which will be Zion. CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 19, TALMAGE'S ARTICLES OF FAITH Two Gathering Places Some of the passages quoted in connection with the dispersion and the subsequent gathering of Israel make reference to Jerusalem, which is to be re-established, and Zion, which is to be built. True, the latter name is in many cases used as a synonym of the first, owing to the fact that a certain hill within Jerusalem of old was known specifically as Zion, or Mount Zion; and the name of a part is often used figuratively to designate the whole; but in other passages the separate and distinctive meaning of the terms is clear. Micah predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and its associated Zion (Micah Page 576 3:12), and then announced a new condition that is to exist in the last days, when another \"mountain of the house of the Lord\" is to be established and this is to be called Zion (Micah 4:1-2; Isaiah 2:2-3) Joel (Joel 3:16). Zephaniah (Zeph. 3: 14-16),' Zechariah (Zech. 1:17; 2:7- 12), Isaiah ( Isa. 4:3-4; 40:9), as well as other prophets, have looked forward toward Zion and Jerusalem. The Name \"Zion\" By derivation, Zion probably meant bright or sunny; but this commonplace signification, is lost in the deeper and more affecting meaning LESSON DEPARTMENT that the word as a name and title came to acquire. The name has been applied as follows: 1. To the hill itself, or Mount Zion, and, by extension of meaning, to Jerusaiem. 2. To the location of the \"mountain of the house of the Lord,\" which Micah predicts shall be established in the last days, distinct from Jerusalem. To these we may add another application of the name as made known through moder revelation, ViZ.: 3. To the City of Holiness, founded by Enoch, the seventh patriarch in descent from Adam, and called by him Zion. (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:18-21 ) 4. Yet another use of the term is to be noteda metaphorical oneby which the Church of God is called Zion, comprising, according to the Lord's own definition, the pure in heart (Doctrine and Covenants 97: 21). Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\" is generally believed to mean by derivation the foundation or city of peace. We meet it for the first time as Salem, the abode of Melchizedek, high priest and king, to whom Abram paid tithes (Gen. 14:18-20). During the reigns of David and Solomon, the city as the capital of the undivided kingdom acquired great fame for its riches, beauty, and strength, its chief attraction being the imposing Temple of Solomon, (see I Kings, chaps. 5-8; 2 Chron., chaps. 2-7). Again will the ancient city become a royal seat, her throne that of the King of Kings, 577 with permanency of glory assured. The Latter-day Zion; New Jerusalem Biblical statements concerning the Zion of the last days, as separate from both the ancient and re-estabished Jerusalem of the east, are silent regarding the geographical location of this second and latter day capital of Christ's kingdom. We learn something, however, from the Bible as to the physical characteristics of the region wherein Zion is to be built. It is explicit regarding the mountainous character of the country of modern Zion which is to be an ensign to the world. (Micah 4: 1-2; Isa. 2:2-3; 33:15-17; 18:1-3). The teachings of the Book of Mormon, and the truths made known through revelation in 'the present dispensation ate more explicit in regard to location. In these scriptures, the names Zion and New Jerusalem are used synonymously, the latter designation being given in honor of Jerusalem of the east. John the Revelator (Rev. 21:2), and Ether (Ether 13:3-8) foretell the establishment of this New Jerusalem, as did Jesus Christ when visiting the Nephites in America, soon after his resurrection (3 Nephi 20:22; 21: 22-24). Ether the Jaredite, and John the Revelator, separated by more than six centuries of time and prophesying on opposite hemispheres, each saw the New Jerusalem come down from heaven \"prepared,\" says the Jewish apostle \"'as a bride adorned for her husband\" (Rev. 21:2). \"The Church in this day teaches that the return of this city from the heavens in glory, is the return of exalted Enoch and his righteous people; and that the people of the Zion of Enoch, 576 and the modern Zion, or the gathered saints on the western continent, will become one people. Latter-day revelation has designated Independence, Missouri, as the \"center place\" of Zion (Doctrine and Covenants 57:1-5). On August 3, 1831, the temple-site was dedicated by the prophet, Joseph Smith, and his associates in the Priesthood. Great events are to mark the latter days: Zion shall yet be established on this chosen site, and \"shall not be moved out of her place,\" and the pure in heart, shall return \"with songs of everlasting joy, to build up the waste places of Zion.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 101:17-18, 43, 74, 75; 103:1, 11; 136:18). Zion is to be chastened, but only for a little season (Doctrine and Covenants 100:13). Redemption will come, but it is to be determined according to the faithfulness of the people (Doctrine and Covenants 105:9). As long ago as 1834 came the word of the Lord unto the Church: \"Behold I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people, speaking concerning the Church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now\" (Doctrine and Covenants 105:1-2).

If any class or ward members have visited either of these places choose them, if possible, to make the reports. A Committee of Specialists Six representative members of the class could be selected by the class leadr well in advance of the lesson to become specialists on the chapter \"Zion.\" They should do extensive reading and research on this subject. On the theology day, they should each have with them their detailed notes, their Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, and should be familiar enough with the references to find passages quickly. They should be seated at a table in the front of the class. The class leader should direct the procedure of the hour, using the committee members to answer questions, make explanations, etc., to bring out the points of the lesson. Note: The above procedure suggested for the six members might be LESSON DEPARTMENT adopted, in part, by all members of the class. \"To be thoroughly acquainted with the lesson is to be thoroughly interested in it.\" 'The class 579 members should be urged to familiarize themselves with the lesson and to bring to class the standard works of our Church each theology lesson day. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The time is soon coming, when no man will have any peace but in Zion and her stakes. (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 161.) And what is Zion? In one sense Zion is the pure in heart. But is there a land that ever will be called Zion? Yes, brethren. What land is it? It is the land that the Lord gave to Jacob, who bequeathed it to his son Joseph, and his posterity, and they inhabit it, and that land is North and South America. That is Zion, as to land, as to territory, and location. The children of Zion have not yet much in their possession, but their territory is North and South America to begin with. As to the spirit of - Zion, it is in the hearts of the Saints of those who love and serve the Lord with all their might, mind and strength. (Discourses of Brigham Young, edition of 1925, pages 183-184.) We want all the Latter-day Saints to understand how to build up Zion. The City of Zion, in beauty and magnificence, will outstrip anything that is now known upon the earth. The curse will be taken from the earth and sin and corruption will be swept from its face. Who will do this great work? Is the Lord going to convince the people that he will redeem the center Stake of Zion, beautify it and then place them there without an exertion on their part? No. He will not come here to build a Temple, a Tabernacle, a Bowery, or to set out fruit trees, make aprons of fig leaves or coats of skins, or work in brass and iron, for we already know how to do these things. He will not come here to teach us how to raise and manufacture cotton, how to make hand cards, how to card, how to make spinning machines, looms, etc., etc. We have to build up Zion, if we do our duty. (Discourses of Brigham Young, edition of 1925, page 184.)\n\nVisiting Teachers\nMessages to the Home\nSources of Strength\nLesson 3Freedom of Choice\nTuesday, December 7, 1943\nFREEDOM of choice develops people, makes them strong and self-reliant. They must think and act for themselves. Free agency is a basic principle in man's development. Without it, he can never reach the high destiny marked out for him. The right to choose his course in life, to say how he will worship and whom, to walk the earth as a free man, are some of the reasons, if not the principal ones, why\n580\nthis great war is being waged. In the august council held in Heaven before the world was framed or man appeared upon its surface, Satan sought to rob us of our agency. He and his followers were defeated, and the forces of righteousness and truth were triumphant. They were victorious in that contest, and they will always ultimately prevail.\nMan's development rests upon his agency. Democratic government is built upon the fundamental idea that men are able to govern themselves, that they are happier when they do it, that no man has the right to govern another man without that man's consent, that enforced obedience is not only contrary to the will and purpose of the Almighty, but contrary to man's highest happiness. If the individual has not the power of choice, if he is denied his agency, how can he be held accountable for something he cannot do? We are given to know right from wrong and are free to choose.\nOur Heavenly Father never resorts to force or compulsion.\nHe'll call, persuade, direct aright, And bless with wisdom, love, and light; In nameless ways be good and kind, But never force the human mind.\nWe all have the right of choice, but when a choice is once made, we are responsible for the consequences.\nThese questions may arise: Why are we subject to temptation? Why is the world made hard? The world is made hard to make men and women strong. It takes rough seas to make good sailors. Without overcoming obstacles, life would be flat, unprofitable, and great quality in character would be impossible.\n\"Who would take adversity from men? He who banishes hardship banishes hardihood, and out of the same door with calamity walks courage and fortitude, triumphant faith, and sacrificial love.\"\nYou remember \"The Two Roads,\" by Jean Paul Richter. This is the story of a boy who dreamed that he was an old man and that he had chosen the wrong road, and he cried in the anguish of his soul for the days of his youth to returnthe days when his father took him to the fork of the roads and told him he had his choice. He explained that one road led into a dark cave where serpents hissed and crawled and where poison flowed instead of water, and the other led into sunny lands where harvests waved and birds sang. In his dream he thought he had taken the wrong road, and his heart was full of remorse. Fortunately it was only a dream. How important it is to make the right choice!\nDiscussion\n1. How is one made strong through making decisions for oneself?\n2. What factors will aid one in choosing aright?\n3. Discuss the quotation: \"The pursuit of easy things makes men weak, while a mastery of the difficult makes men strong.\"\nReferences\nDoctrine and Covenants, Sec. 29:36; 101:78-79 Pearl of Great Price, Moses 4:1-3; 7:32 Discourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925, chapter V, pp. 95-103.

No people have surpassed them in the creation of songs, especially those of a religious type. These Biblical lyrics are to be found mainly in the Old Testament, where they often occur in story settings or are grouped, as in the Psalms, in what we might today call a religious songbook.\nHow shall one distinguish a Bible lyric from the Bible story in which it is sometimes found? It would be rather difficult to do so, if one had only the King James version of the Bible. There, as has been said before, the various literary forms are all cast in a \"chapter and verse\" mold. But take the Modern Reader's Bible, by Dr. R. G. Moulton, or another such volume, The Bible Designed to be Read as Living Literature, by Ernest S. Bates, wherein the Bible is cast in its literary forms, and the lyrics lift into the clear.\nIn the study of the Bible lyric which comes in its story setting, we have a marked advantage. It is like a rose that blooms at the end of a thorny stem. Back of the song is the stirring tale that quickens into lyrical expression at the strategic moment. This is not unlike what occurs in grand opera when the story that is being dramatized rises into such a lyric gem as the \"Jewel Song\" in Faust, the \"Sextet\" in Lucia. Here is one basic difference: the Bible lyric is generally deeply religious in its cast and nature.\nLet us add concreteness to these thoughts with a few typical illustrations:\nMoses has broken the chains of bondage of his oppressed people. Rising in stirring climax, the epic of the Plagues has brought the story to the point when the King, feeling God's wrath in the death of his own son, has set the Israelites free. They\n582\nare on their way to the Promised Land. An army pursues. The waters of the Red Sea have been rolled back, and the people pass through, while the pursuers are drowned in the depths. Up to this point the story is all told in swiftly-moving Biblical prose; but even such expression cannot adequately depict the exultation that sweeps over Israel at its deliverance. It is here that a nation's heart bursts into superb song:\nI will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and my song, And he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: The Lord is his name, Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the Gods? Who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?\n(See Exodus 15:1-17; Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 67-68.)\nThe foregoing quotation is, of course, only part of this stirring lyrical ode. This excerpt, however, reveals something of a Bible song in its story setting.\nAnother lyric of rare artistry, David's Lament, closes the epic of the warrior king of Israel. When the tragic word of the death of Saul, the\nking, and his son Jonathan, David's dearest friend, comes to him, the soul of David is expressed in these lyric lines:\nThy glory, O Israel, Is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty Fallen!\nTell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Askelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\nYe mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, Neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, as of one not anointed with oil.\n\nSaul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.\nYe daughters of Israel, Weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.\nHow are the mighty Fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, Slain upon thy high places.\nI am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love for me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.\nHow are the mighty Fallen! And the weapons of war Perished!\n(See 2 Sam. 1:19-27; Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 281-282.)\nOther well known lyrics woven into the Bible stories are the plea of Ruth, Hannah's song of rejoicing over the birth of Samuel, David's Lament over Absalom.\nBesides these gems of poetry that sparkle in their various settings, there are many beautiful lyrics in the books of prophecy, especially those in Isaiah. Of these more will be said in a later lesson.\nThe Psalms, as already said, are a collection of the songs of Israel. Many of these echo in the hearts of people all over the world, for in their entirety or in part, they are being sung by God-fearing folk everywhere. Eminent literary critics have ranked Psalm Twenty-threeThe Shepherd Psalmas one of the finest lyrics ever created. Its lovely lines have sung solace and faith and trust into the hearts of thousands upon thousands down the years. Observe the sweet cadence and consoling thought as you read aloud these beginning lines:\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me beside the still waters, He restoreth my soul.\nRhythmic beauty is given to the Bible lyric, as shown in this and the other parts of songs quoted in this lesson, by the parallel form in which the songs are cast. Observe that the thought of the lyric is expressed then re-expressed in different words. This is an outstanding characteristic of Hebrew verse. In effect, this repetition not only reimpresses the thought but gives to the lyric a musical beauty and, with the artistic changes in the parallel lines, avoids monotony.\nAnother characteristic of the Bible lyric, which marks indeed all great\n583\nlyrics, is the vividness of word pictures; for example, observe in the lines just quoted what a delightful scene is deftly sketched of a shepherd with his flock. Note also the pictures that come from these expressions, \"swifter than eagles,\" \"stronger than lions,\" \"in scarlet delicately,\" \"passing the love of woman.\"\nA wealth of artistry, with an uplift into things divine, is in the study of the Bible lyric. Our hope is that this lesson may prove an \"open sesame\" to these treasures. It remains for those who study it to carry forward.\nDiscussion and Activities\n1. What is the origin of the word lyric? Name some lyric in the Bible, other than those given in this lesson, which has brought uplift to you.\n2. It has been said that back of every great song lies a story. How is this truth illustrated by some of the lyrics found in the Bible?\n3. What is the main theme of the lyrics created by the Children of Israel? Why?\n4. One poet has said, \"Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.\" Apply this thought to the creation of some Bible lyric; to the negro spirituals; to any other rare lyric.\n5. What is meant by \"parallel verse\"? Illustrate with quotations from one of your favorite psalms. By reading the quotation aloud show the musical effect of the parallel lines.\n6. Find two expressions in some Bible lyric that suggest pictures.\n7. Read aloud all of Psalm 23 or 24, or some other Bible lyric. Note the cadence, the word pictures, the religious uplift that comes from the lyric chosen.\n8. How are Bible lyrics echoed in many of the songs we sing today? Give an illustration.\n\nSocial Science\nNO social science lesson is printed in this issue of the Magazine, as no lesson for this department is planned for the month of December, due to the holiday season.\n\nStories from the Book of Mormon\nNO lesson for this department is printed in this issue of the Magazine, as the General Board does not require that a meeting be held on Tuesday, December 28, due to the holiday season.\n\nERRATUM\nATTENTION is called to an error in the social science lesson, no. 9, in the Augustpage 515, which erroneously names John Marshall as the first Chief Justice of the United States.

Three years later he was chosen to be first counselor in the stake presidency, and, in 1938, he was made president of the Boise Stake in which capacity he served until he moved to Washington, D. C. with his family.\nElder Benson is blessed with a devoted wife who has supported him in all his endeavors. Flora Smith Amussen is the youngest daughter of Utah's pioneer jeweler, Carl Christian Amussen, and Barbara Smith.

            "content": "Stumps Of Opportunities\nJohn M. Freckleton\nTHE tree was extremely tall and bare. Against the flushed evening sky it would stand sharply outlined in its nakedness, as though graven on the wall of the heavens. I don't know what kind of tree it was, though it may have been an elm. But on the many occasions when I passed it, I was deeply impressed by its lonely dignity. It was an interesting tree. To follow the long, lean lines of its limbless trunk high into the sky, finding far above a few twisted branches, was an inspiring act. The sight of this tree always made me long to write a beautiful poem about it. But I never had time.\nOne day, not long ago, I chanced to pass the corner where stood this tree. Where it had been flowed empty sky. The tree was gone, and where its roots had sought the earth was a low, shattered stump. Tall majesty had shrunk to obscurity. Doubtless the long bole had been ruthlessly sawed into convenient lengths for logsand my poem was gone. The feeling that came over me when I viewed the scanty remains was not an altogether new one. I felt regret over its untimely fate, certainly, but more definitely, sorrow over not having written my poem. With the inspiration gone, whence would come its dedication? But, as I have said, the feeling of sorrow was not a new one for me. Many times in my life, I have found myself experiencing a similar emotion. Things I should have done, things I would have done, left undone.\nInteresting people I have neglected until too late. My grandfather was an unusual sort of person. He crossed the plains with grandmother, pushing a handcart. In the wilderness of Utah Territory, he helped establish a vigorous commonwealth. He helped enforce law and justice, he aided in the fight for truth, and served as a man of God. During his early years here, he was a justice of the peace, a bishop, and twice a missionary to his native country, Old Ireland. And in the meantime, he was able to be a good father to twelve children. Both he and grandmother saw the roughness of frontier life, yet he was always a lover of art, music, and literature. Not only did he read the works of the great masters, but he attempted to capitalize on the inspiration they gave by writing for himself. He was not especially successful in writing, but in the rough country where he lived he was eminently successful in finding beauty.\nFor a long time I had intended interviewing grandfather on his early life in Ireland and Scotland, and about his journey to Utah and life here. Never finding time, I failed to accomplish this desire. He has been dead quite a number of years now, and all the interesting tales he could have told, and the valuable information he could have given me have gone with him. Of him, I have but a stump of memory, nothing else.\nPage 585\n586\nIn a similar way, I have come into contact with other interesting personalities, failed to take advantage of my opportunities to gain something from them, and later found myself regretting my procrastination.\nOn numerous occasions I have gone to concerts or lectures, heard a marvelous performance by a brilliant artist, and fought a losing fight with myself to walk up and talk with this person face to face. And it would not have been hard to do. Once I had an excellent opportunity, through a mutual acquaintance, to meet and talk with Percy Grainger, the noted composer and pianist. For some unimportant reason, I neglected going to the hall where he was rehearsing, and consequently, my only contact with him was that of a deeply thrilled member of his concert audience. Another stump of lost opportunity to look back on.\nAll this suggests that day by day we are all missing good opportunities to get more out of life. The stumps of many noble trees are doubtless strewn along our way. The fact that we can look back over a period of years and see, with regret, many worthwhile things we could have done is proof of this. Perhaps it was a poem that should have been written. Perhaps service to humanity that was neglected. We all like to feel that we have been useful to the world. But all the while we are likely to find ourselves merely sliding through life, merely existing.\nI could have been a strong pillar of the church, one might say to himself. I could have been more devoted to the Church rather than giving mere lukewarm allegiance. The books which should have been\nread, the letters which should have been written, the hundred and one minor deeds of life which should have been done, these all leave disturbing stumps where noble opportunities once flourished.\nOpportunity, however, is never in the future, but constantly at hand. Yet when we at last find time, opportunity is often gone. It is no longer a noble, inspiring tree, it is a useless stump. It is as much truth as poetry to say that there is no yesterday, nor tomorrow, but only today. Opportunity is not yesterday, nor will it be tomorrow, it is here today, and the only time to enjoy it is the present.\nAfter all, when we look about us and see the people who have done the things we might have done, isn't it evident that they did not wait for a better time? Had they done so, they would probably still be waiting. Rather than a saddening field of stumps to contemplate, they boast a flourishing grove.\nOne of these days, not very, very long from now, we will find ourselves in another life, the life of the hereafter. There we will be given the task, perhaps, of looking back upon the life we have left, of considering all that we have done. Then, if never before, we will learn the truth of the expression, \"of all the sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, 'it might have been.'\"\nWill we see in retrospect a depressing expanse of broken stumps of opportunities, or will we see a charming forest of tall trees, with scarcely a stump to be seen? Well, that's your task, and mine. Let's see what we are going to do about it.\n\nEvery child needs a Bible...\nIt is the symbol of Christianity, the hope for the future. It is the lifetime gift... Remembered and treasured always.\nAMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY\nBIBLES\nSINCE 1863\nAt Your Bible Bookstore"

Having learned how to use material effectively, a writer may produce good, bad, or mediocre stories, according to her conscience and talents; but at least she'll have a possibility of marketing them.

            "content": "Eighteen in August,\" by Roma Rose, is here reprinted by permission of the author and Collier's magazine. This story has been chosen because it is the kind of story anyone of us might - think of writing, and, at the same time, it is expertly enough done to be acceptable to a magazine that places a very high premium indeed on expertness. In considering the story, \"Eighteen in August,\" we find that there is nothing new about the theme: the struggle between the possessive mother and her child. Many authors have capitalized on its poignancy; it Page 540 has appeared in Therecurrently, and it is within anyone's ken, for one need not leave her neighborhood to encounter it, If the choice of theme is the first step in planning the story, a rather general plot situation must next be formulated. In this story, a young man, at the one moment when he might best free himself from his mother's possessiveness, cannot tear himself away, and as a result lives a life essentially incomplete. So far, any of us could do about as well. But now the question arises as to how to tell the story. How to depict the struggle and the decision. How to dramatize the long, empty years. How to give a striking conclusion to a story in which the whole point is that nothing happensgive it short-story form, in fact. \"Eighteen in August\" is one answer to these questions. In a few hundred words, Mrs. Rose tells how Professor Locke diffidently persuades young Woodbridge to make the decision that offers him freedom of soul. The rest of the story leaves us alone with the Professor, who did not achieve that freedom for himself. And suddenly we see that the story of the lad is also and primarily the story of the Professor's own youth and the decision he also had to make. The turning point in his life has also SHORT-STORY WRITING been revealed and the life-long consequences of his choice. The all-important unity of the story is never threatened by this device, for it is the Professor's story from the first word. It is seen through his eyes; he creates its emotional tone. We have finished with the lad when he makes his decision. It is with the Professor that we survey the future. Unity is also insured by the clarity with which the issue is defined: the right of a son to possess his own soul. It is in no sense a plea that boys go into the army instead of medicine, that they marry before they march away, or that they ignore the advice of their mothers. And notice that the issue is defined by the characters, not lectured about by the author. Note also the care with which the author has worked to make her characters convincing even though they are types, of course, not individuals in the true sense. The mothers are charming, vigorous, companionable women, the kind who could hold intelligent sons. The young man and the old are sensitive, loyal, and conscientious, but without the emotional drive that translates feelings into action. They are also the sort whose work is absorbing enough to make an almost satisfactory substitute for other things, leaving not too much time for \"quiet desperation.\" Another important part of the plot construction is the preparation made for the Professor's words to become a decisive factor in the boy's life. Too often a talk, a picture, a single incident will be made the deciding factor in a story without the reader's seeing why it has such power. This has been a baleful weakness in too many \"moral\" stories. A reader will 541 accept the fact that the right word at the right time may alter a whole life, but he certainly ought to know why it was the right word and why the time was ripe for it. Study the extreme economy of explanation, the point where the unskillful writer so often bogs down. It would be an excellent exercise to expand this story, to discover whether its effectiveness would be increased by more detail. The sparseness of description may bother you, and again, it would be instructive to amplify it and compare results. (And here it might be mentioned parenthetically, that the stories in the files of the Magazine reveal that Utah women have a feeling for atmosphere, for the homely, memorable detail, for the color of every-day living that lends authenticity to many an otherwise almost formless nartrative. It is a gift to cultivate, never to sacrifice to glibness and stock phrases. ) In writing this story, of course, Mrs. Rose was working under the severe restrictions imposed by the short-short story''a most difficult form' she writes, and one which too often emerges a sketch or incident. It will be interesting to decide if and where she might have expanded it under different length requirements, or whether it has the \"inevitable length\" that Somerset -Maugham uses as one test of a good story. And when you come to the end of \"Eighteen in August\" pause long to admire the ending. It's hard to get a story of this kind ended effectively. When an author sums up a story in so perfect a bit of dramatic irony, we take off our hats to a job well done. 542 Along with any plea for aspiring writers to struggle to master the techniques of their craft, a warning should be sounded against too much devotion to the authors who have achieved publication with deft, \"smart\" writing which has little else to recommend it. This cheapening of talent can be followed in its stages by reading the groping but impassioned early work of some of our living American writers, and then comparing it with their deft but unmoving and insignificant current stories. They are like people who acquire social aplomb at the expense of character and individuality. For although sincerity, an honest point of view, and genuine emotion cannot, in and of themselves, make good stories, no stories can be worth the writing without them. Eighteen In August By Roma Rose  Reprinted from Collier's for May 15, 1943, by permission of the author and Collier's. ROFESSOR LOCKE listened, nodding soberly from time to time. \"With his 1. Q. Of 137,\" the woman was saying, \"he can carry this schedule. That leaves Saturday afternoons and Tuesdays and Thursdays from four to six for his laboratory work, and, of course, Sundays.\" She was the mother of one of his studentsa tall, handsome woman with straight black brows in a strong and intelligent face. She had come to get her son through his premedical course in two years instead of three, so that he would be deferred from the draft as a full medical student as soon as he was eighteen. Professor Locke glanced again at the record of George Woodbridge on the desk before him. Nothing but A's and B's. One of his best students. \"It might be possible,\" he said. \"But I don't think it is advisable.\" \"Nonsense,\" Mrs. Woodbridge said, looking at him with a contradicting stare. \"He hasn't been doing so well lately.\" \"He's worried, naturally,\" she said. \"Once we get this settled, he'll be all right.\" \"T don't believe he can do it even if I were to allow him to try. But I'll go into the matter thoroughly. His transcripteverything. I do not feel justified in giving my consent without considering the entire case.\" She rose to go. \"I know you won't be too academic about this, Professor. It is more than just a matter of credits and points.\" She managed a smile, charming, persuasive. '\"'As long as I live, I will feel that you have saved my son for me.\" \"I will consider it carefully,\" he said. \"Goodby, Mrs. Woodbridge.\" Professor Locke walked down the hall and found young Woodbridge in the laboratory. \"Mr. Woodbridge, EIGHTEEN IN AUGUST I want to speak to you. As soon as vou can, come into my office.\" The young man_ straightened. \"Yes, sir. J can come now.\" He had smooth, light brown hair, and he ran his hand over it. His eyes were gray and larger than his mother's. He must resemble his father, Professor Locke thought. \"Your mother has been here.\" The young man blushed as he walked along. \"She said she was coming in.\" \"So you want to hurry up and be a doctor?\" \"Wellyes, sir.\" At the office, the young man opened the door for Professor Locke and then followed him inside. \"Sit down, Mr. Woodbridge. What made you want to study medicine?\" \"Well, I always knew that's what I was going to do. My mother and I have talked about it and planned for it since I was a kid.\" Professor Locke fingered the paperweight on his desk. \"Let's seeyou'll be eighteen in August... How do you feel about going into the Army?\" The boy breathed once before he lifted his eyes. His features, clearcut though they were, now blurred with indecision. \"I really don't know, sir.\" There was a pause. \"It doesn't seem like the Great Adventure, certainly. And I'm not attracted by any of the hero stuffbut I keep feeling\" He hurried now, faster as he went\"I keep feeling I ought to go. I'm not married. I'm not prepared for my profession yet. What I mean is: I haven't as much to lose as most of them.\" 543 \"So you've decided\" Professor Locke prompted helpfully. The boy flushed. \"But my mother\" he said. \"And of course, as she says, we'll be needing doctors after it's over. It can't last forever.\" He swallowed. \"Tll do my best, sir, to carry the work.\" \"T'm sure you would.\" Professor Locke paused. \"In your own mind, though, you think you should go. Is that right?\" \"T don't know for sure. But I'm afraid that's the way it looks to me.\" He put both his feet firmly on the floor. \"Sometimes,\" Professor Locke said, \"it is difficult to distinguish between responsibility and dependency in our relations with our fellow human beings.\" The young man was thoughtful. \"I'm not sure I know what you mean, sir.\" \"Whether we are responsible for them, or dependent on them,\" the professor explained. \"The distinction is fine.\" For the first time in years, he could remember Katharine's face clearly as they stood on the steps of the Chemistry Building that spring night in 1917. And the bitterness in her voice as she had said, \"I know why she wants us to wait until you come back... But it's not her life. It's yours and mine.\" \"The distinction is fine,\" he said again. \"Sometimes almost indistinguishable.\" The boy looked at him, puzzled, trying to understand. Professor Locke knew that look well. \"I talk like a bad textbook,\" he said and laughed in his classroom manner. \"Let me put it this way: 544 It is exceedingly difficult to hurt those whom we love, or who love us.\" He knew he was hiding behind words but he was getting closer. \"Yes, sir. It is.\" So difficult, Professor Locke thought, looking at this boy's face, at the uncertainty in his young eyes, that he will not be able to do it alone. \"What I am trying to say to you, George, is this: In the life of nearly every man, there comes a time when he must say no to his mother. When his own judgment must be his only guide.\" \"You really think so, sir?\" The boy's voice was hopeful. \"I know it.\" The professor did not move until the words had come, harshly. Then he leaned back in his chair, stiff and brittle... old. \"I'm glad to hear you say that, sir. I believe that, too. But my mother \" He hesitated. \"She's pretty determined. It won't be easy.\" I could settle it, Professor Locke thought quickly. I could say: No, he can't carry this heavy schedule. He's too young. But that's not the point. \"It's up to you, Woodbridge,\" he said. For one long, wavering moment, the boy sat there. He ran his hand nervously over his smooth brown hair. Then it was over. \"Ill do it,\" he said quietly, surely. He got up. \"I don't know how. It will be awful. But thank you, sir.\" He took a step to the door. \"Thank you, sir.\" Professor Locke came around the desk. \"I am not sending you out to die,\" he said, self-conscious at his own seriousness. \"That is not my decision to make. Nor yours. This is something else. I don't know if you understand, but I admire you. I hope you will come back. I'd like to see you finish here. Good luck, Mr. Woodbridge.\" He put out his hand, and the young man clasped it. ROFESSOR LOCKE sat down slowly. His heart was pounding. He was very tired, but he must get home now; he was expected. He was never later than five o'clock. He filled his brief case with orderly stacks of papers. He buttoned his overcoat carefully to the top and went out. ' His mother was waiting in her chair, her thick white hair lookin vigorous and handsome and wel kept. Her knitting lay in her lap. He bent and touched his lips to the cheek she offered. \"And how was it today, son?\" She was always so interested in everything he did. \"Did you have a hard day? You look tired.\" \"No,\" he said. \"I had a good day.\" \"I'm so glad. What happened?\" \"Nothing.\" Usually he told her the little high lights, arranging them with care, making them seem important. \"I had some conferences... One of my best students is going into the Army.\" \"What a shame!\" She sighed and picked up her knitting. \"You know, dear,\" she said, \"I'm so thankful that you're over the draft age. I couldn't let you go. You're all I've got.\" She gave him a bright, loving smile. \"Yes. Mother,' he said. \"And you're all I've got.\" He went into his study and closed the door."

            "content": "Seek Knowledge IN the threshold of the new educational year in Relief Society, and in the midst of personal trials and sorrows which today form a part of life's pattern for the very great majority of Relief Society members, they will desire, perhaps more than at any other time in their lives, to draw nearer to the Lord, and, by obedience to His commandments, to better merit His blessings. In contemplation of this year's work, each member may ask herself what one thing she may do in order to grow spiritually. Certainly a fundamental law was given to man when the Lord declared, \"It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance\"; and the Prophet Joseph Smith said, \"The principle of knowledge is the principle of salvation.\" One object, therefore, for which all members might strive would be to better learn the principles of salvation in order the better to live in accordance with them. The Prophet Joseph Smith has told us, \"the conditions of God's kingdom are such, that all who are made partakers of that glory, are under the necessity of learning something respecting it, previous to their entering into it.\" As Latter-day Saints, we are candidates for the celestial kingdom, the highest kingdom of which we have any knowledge, and therefore it is essential that each one learn what Page 552 she can of its requirements and laws, in order that she may pattern her life in accordance with its laws, and thus not only prepare herself to dwell therein, but to live a full and abundant life here. The courses of study in Relief Society for the year 1943-44 offer Relief Society members a rich opportunity to gain a greater knowledge of the Gospel. If every member would prayerfully study the lessons as outlined, and the references, and then continue with her reading as her interest might lead her, she would, at the close of the year's lesson work, find herself possessed of far greater knowledge than she does at the present time. The theology lessons, based on The Articles of Faith by Dr. Talmage, will impart information which is fundamental to an understanding of the tenets of the Church. The literature lessons, Bible Literature, using the King James translation of the Bible as a textbook, will lead the student into a study of the Bible and an appreciation of its literary qualities as well. In the Messages to the Home lessons, each member will recognize basic sources of strength which will help her to carry on more valiantly, and by a study of the references for these lessons, she will be guided to the sermons and writings of our great Church leaders. The study of American history, in the social science EDITORIAL department, written from the viewpoint held by Latter-day Saints in regard to the great principle of free agency, of liberty, and of the divine influence exercised in framing our Constitution, will aid Relief Society members, as American citizens, to better uphold fundamental concepts of our Government. Let each Relief Society member, then, seek during this coming season to take greater advantage of the knowledge of spiritual matters to be gained by a study of the courses outlined for Relief Society, and resolve to increase her knowledge of eternal truth. Let her find time for such a study, though it may entail foregoing some reading of current fiction 553 and drama, and. Fewer amusements, none of whose worth can compare with the joy and satisfaction to be derived from a study of the Gospel. By thus increasing her knowledge of Church doctrine, each member will better be able to obey the admonition of Paul who said, \"... Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"M. C. S. L. D. S. Men In The Armed Service (Continued from page 533) charitycommended by Jesus. A humble profession of faith and strict adherence to standards of conduct in conformity with that faith, always, in the long run, win the respect of normal men and women. We have known many examples of this, and also of the reversethe cases of Latter-day Saint men who have lost the respect and confidence of non-Church members because these men failed to live up to the principles of their Church, or seemed to be ashamed of their Church connections and the principles for which their people stand. Firmness of faith in the right, together with stamina and moral courage to practice and to defend the right are outstanding qualities of character. Certainly no Latter-day Saint can afford to be lacking in these character qualities.\nWe sympathize with young men in the armed service of their country in the difficult and hazardous situation in which they are placed. Generally speaking, it is no fault of theirs. It is, however, a sign of weakness for them to let this situation lead them to become reckless as to their moral and religious obligations, and thus toward their own lasting happiness and the happiness of their loved ones. It is to be hoped that these loved ones will not be remiss in doing everything possible to encourage and strengthen their relatives and friends who have been called to face the physical and moral hazards of war.\n\nNotes to the Field\nStake Planning Meeting Recommended During September\nAS in 1942, the General Board, with the special approval of the First Presidency, again recommends that a stake planning meeting be held during the month of September, preliminary to the beginning of regular weekly meetings in October, for all stake board members, ward officers, and class leaders. It is recommended that, wherever possible, this meeting be arranged in connection with a stake priesthood meeting or a stake quarterly conference in order to keep transportation at a minimum.\nThe purpose of this meeting is to stimulate all phases of Relief Society work at the beginning of the 1943-44 season, to preview lesson work and other activities planned for the coming year, and to give whatever instructions and help are deemed necessary by the stake board.\nWe feel sure that all Relief Society officers and class leaders will greatly appreciate this privilege granted by the First Presidency of holding this special meeting for stake and ward officers in order to better prepare for the coming season's work.\nStake Relief Society presidents will please acquaint their respective stake presidents with the recommendation that this special meeting be held and arrange with them as to the most favorable time for calling the meeting. Stake Relief Society presidents are requested to send complete details of this meeting to all ward presidents as soon as possible so that good ward representation may be assured.\nWe are sure that stake board members will make every effort to take full advantage of this special meeting and that they will be well prepared to conduct their respective departments for ward workers at this meeting.\nWard Relief Society Conferences, November 7, 1943\nCONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on the evenings of Fast Sundays, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 7, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual Relief Society conference.\nPage 554\nWard Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons\nNOTES TO THE FIELD\nand other work, near the beginning of the educational season.\nIt is recommended that the conference consist of two meetingsa preliminary meeting for officers, and a general session for all Relief Society members and for all other members of the ward. In order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that visiting teachers on their regular November visits invite all ward members to be present at this meeting and that advance announcements of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.\nA suggested program for the general session of the conference, with detailed instructions for its presentation, will be mailed to each ward Relief Society president in September.\n555\n\nSpencer W. Kimball, The Arizona Apostle\n(Continued from page 530)\nzonians for his work in Church, business, civic enterprises, and service clubs, notably in Rotary. Banking was his first work, but after eight and a half years of banking experience, he resigned to purchase an interest in a small new struggling insurance business which has since become the leading insurance and realty firm in eastern Arizona. He has derived great pleasure from his farming and livestock operations as well.\nThe Church activities of the new member of the General Authorities have been varied and continuous. When but fourteen, he became an assistant teacher in Sunday School and while yet in high school he was appointed chorister of the stake Sunday School. He sang, for many years, in ward and stake choirs, at times substituting as organist or pianist. His missionary work under President Samuel O. Bennion, in Missouri, was one of the highlights of his life. Upon returning from his mission he became first, stake clerk in 1918, then counselor in the stake presidency in 1924, where he continued to serve until the St. Joseph Stake was divided in 1938, and he was called to be the first stake president of Mt. Graham Stake, the position he was occupying at the time of his call to the apostleship.\nThis is the first time in the history of the Church that an apostle has been called from Arizona, and many people in the seven Arizona stakes will rejoice in his appointment, and business and professional men will feel honored by his call.\nElder Kimball has been favored with a charming wife, who has always been helpful and understanding. Camilla Eyring is the daughter of Edward Christian Eyring and Caroline Romney who lived in Mexico until 1912. Four children have been born to the Kimballs, Spencer LeVan, a commissioned officer in the United States Naval Reserve, Olive Beth, Andrew Eyring, and Edward Lawrence. The love, consideration, and thoughtfulness manifested for each other by the members of the family\n556\nhave made this family unit the pride of many admirers.\nPresident Kimball is rugged and strong, due to his outdoor life, early hard work, and strict observance of the Word of Wisdom. Although he has worked with rough characters in mining camps and one summer as a stevedore in a Los Angeles freight yard, as well as dining with European nobility and aristocracy at which\ndinners many different kinds of intoxicants were served, still, due to his strict early training, he has never tasted tea nor coffee, tobacco nor liquor.\nWith extreme humility, Elder Spencer Woolley Kimball will enter upon his new duties after the October conference where he will be presented for the sustaining vote of that body.\n\nThe Bee Hive House\n(Continued from page 539)\nway for it. The Eagle Gate and the pillars supporting it are not being torn down.\nAFTER President Young's death, his wife, Lucy Decker, whose home it had been since 1860, continued to live there until 1888 when it was acquired by John W. Young.* He took down the story-and-a-half on the north and built three floors, bringing the new addition to the same height as the original building. Many rooms were added, the most important being the large east entrance hall and the spacious back parlor. A heavy carved oak Dutch door was installed at the main entrance and the original door was used for the State Street entrance. The hall was panelled with maple and elaborate mirrored mantels and lighting fixtures were installed. Wide doorways with folding doors were arranged to connect six of the large rooms on the main floor. From the south wall of the front parlor through the wide entrance hall to the north wall of the back parlor was\n*Information gleaned from manuscript, \"The Bee Hive House 1854-1888,\" by Clarissa Young Spencer and her book, One Who Was Valiant, Spencer-Harmer.\na length of 75 feet, making the Bee Hive parlors an ideal place in which to entertain large groups.\nIn 1893, the house became the property of the Latter-day Saint Church and from 1899, was used as the home of the president of the Church. President Lorenzo Snow occupied it for three years. It was President Joseph F. Smith's home for seventeen years. When President Heber J. Grant became president of the Church he decided to remain in his own home on the rim of City Creek Canyon and to allow the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association to use the Bee Hive House as a home for girls who came to the city seeking employment. During the last twenty-three years, thousands of girls have found a real home within the forty-three rooms of this outstanding edifice.\nThe Bee Hive House has had a long useful life. It is dear to the hearts of the members of the Church as one of the few buildings of the pioneer period still standing. The years have but emphasized how well it was built. Stately, sturdy, and strong, it is fitted to serve the future as faithfully as it has served the past."

Sheology Articles of Faith Lesson 19  Zion Tuesday, December 7, 1943 (This is the third chapter dealing with Article 10) Article 10\"\"We believe... Continent, * * *\" that Zion will be built upon this (the American) Lesson Aim: To show that the work of the Lord will cover the whole earth, and two capitals-will be established, one on the eastern and one on the western hemisphere, both of which will be Zion. CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 19, TALMAGE'S ARTICLES OF FAITH Two Gathering Places Some of the passages quoted in connection with the dispersion and the subsequent gathering of Israel make reference to Jerusalem, which is to be re-established, and Zion, which is to be built. True, the latter name is in many cases used as a synonym of the first, owing to the fact that a certain hill within Jerusalem of old was known specifically as Zion, or Mount Zion; and the name of a part is often used figuratively to designate the whole; but in other passages the separate and distinctive meaning of the terms is clear. Micah predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and its associated Zion (Micah Page 576 3:12), and then announced a new condition that is to exist in the last days, when another \"mountain of the house of the Lord\" is to be established and this is to be called Zion (Micah 4:1-2; Isaiah 2:2-3) Joel (Joel 3:16). Zephaniah (Zeph. 3: 14-16),' Zechariah (Zech. 1:17; 2:7- 12), Isaiah ( Isa. 4:3-4; 40:9), as well as other prophets, have looked forward toward Zion and Jerusalem. The Name \"Zion\" By derivation, Zion probably meant bright or sunny; but this commonplace signification, is lost in the deeper and more affecting meaning LESSON DEPARTMENT that the word as a name and title came to acquire. The name has been applied as follows: 1. To the hill itself, or Mount Zion, and, by extension of meaning, to Jerusaiem. 2. To the location of the \"mountain of the house of the Lord,\" which Micah predicts shall be established in the last days, distinct from Jerusalem. To these we may add another application of the name as made known through moder revelation, ViZ.: 3. To the City of Holiness, founded by Enoch, the seventh patriarch in descent from Adam, and called by him Zion. (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:18-21 ) 4. Yet another use of the term is to be noteda metaphorical oneby which the Church of God is called Zion, comprising, according to the Lord's own definition, the pure in heart (Doctrine and Covenants 97: 21). Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\" is generally believed to mean by derivation the foundation or city of peace. We meet it for the first time as Salem, the abode of Melchizedek, high priest and king, to whom Abram paid tithes (Gen. 14:18-20). During the reigns of David and Solomon, the city as the capital of the undivided kingdom acquired great fame for its riches, beauty, and strength, its chief attraction being the imposing Temple of Solomon, (see I Kings, chaps. 5-8; 2 Chron., chaps. 2-7). Again will the ancient city become a royal seat, her throne that of the King of Kings, 577 with permanency of glory assured. The Latter-day Zion; New Jerusalem Biblical statements concerning the Zion of the last days, as separate from both the ancient and re-estabished Jerusalem of the east, are silent regarding the geographical location of this second and latter day capital of Christ's kingdom. We learn something, however, from the Bible as to the physical characteristics of the region wherein Zion is to be built. It is explicit regarding the mountainous character of the country of modern Zion which is to be an ensign to the world. (Micah 4: 1-2; Isa. 2:2-3; 33:15-17; 18:1-3). The teachings of the Book of Mormon, and the truths made known through revelation in 'the present dispensation ate more explicit in regard to location. In these scriptures, the names Zion and New Jerusalem are used synonymously, the latter designation being given in honor of Jerusalem of the east. John the Revelator (Rev. 21:2), and Ether (Ether 13:3-8) foretell the establishment of this New Jerusalem, as did Jesus Christ when visiting the Nephites in America, soon after his resurrection (3 Nephi 20:22; 21: 22-24). Ether the Jaredite, and John the Revelator, separated by more than six centuries of time and prophesying on opposite hemispheres, each saw the New Jerusalem come down from heaven \"prepared,\" says the Jewish apostle \"'as a bride adorned for her husband\" (Rev. 21:2). \"The Church in this day teaches that the return of this city from the heavens in glory, is the return of exalted Enoch and his righteous people; and that the people of the Zion of Enoch, 576 and the modern Zion, or the gathered saints on the western continent, will become one people. Latter-day revelation has designated Independence, Missouri, as the \"center place\" of Zion (Doctrine and Covenants 57:1-5). On August 3, 1831, the temple-site was dedicated by the prophet, Joseph Smith, and his associates in the Priesthood. Great events are to mark the latter days: Zion shall yet be established on this chosen site, and \"shall not be moved out of her place,\" and the pure in heart, shall return \"with songs of everlasting joy, to build up the waste places of Zion.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 101:17-18, 43, 74, 75; 103:1, 11; 136:18). Zion is to be chastened, but only for a little season (Doctrine and Covenants 100:13). Redemption will come, but it is to be determined according to the faithfulness of the people (Doctrine and Covenants 105:9). As long ago as 1834 came the word of the Lord unto the Church: \"Behold I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people, speaking concerning the Church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now\" (Doctrine and Covenants 105:1-2).

A Committee of Specialists Six representative members of the class could be selected by the class leadr well in advance of the lesson to become specialists on the chapter \"Zion.\" They should do extensive reading and research on this subject. On the theology day, they should each have with them their detailed notes, their Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, and should be familiar enough with the references to find passages quickly. They should be seated at a table in the front of the class. The class leader should direct the procedure of the hour, using the committee members to answer questions, make explanations, etc., to bring out the points of the lesson. Note: The above procedure suggested for the six members might be LESSON DEPARTMENT adopted, in part, by all members of the class. \"To be thoroughly acquainted with the lesson is to be thoroughly interested in it.\" 'The class 579 members should be urged to familiarize themselves with the lesson and to bring to class the standard works of our Church each theology lesson day. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The time is soon coming, when no man will have any peace but in Zion and her stakes. (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 161.) And what is Zion? In one sense Zion is the pure in heart. But is there a land that ever will be called Zion? Yes, brethren. What land is it? It is the land that the Lord gave to Jacob, who bequeathed it to his son Joseph, and his posterity, and they inhabit it, and that land is North and South America. That is Zion, as to land, as to territory, and location. The children of Zion have not yet much in their possession, but their territory is North and South America to begin with. As to the spirit of - Zion, it is in the hearts of the Saints of those who love and serve the Lord with all their might, mind and strength. (Discourses of Brigham Young, edition of 1925, pages 183-184.) We want all the Latter-day Saints to understand how to build up Zion. The City of Zion, in beauty and magnificence, will outstrip anything that is now known upon the earth. The curse will be taken from the earth and sin and corruption will be swept from its face. Who will do this great work? Is the Lord going to convince the people that he will redeem the center Stake of Zion, beautify it and then place them there without an exertion on their part? No. He will not come here to build a Temple, a Tabernacle, a Bowery, or to set out fruit trees, make aprons of fig leaves or coats of skins, or work in brass and iron, for we already know how to do these things. He will not come here to teach us how to raise and manufacture cotton, how to make hand cards, how to card, how to make spinning machines, looms, etc., etc. We have to build up Zion, if we do our duty. (Discourses of Brigham Young, edition of 1925, page 184.)\n\nVisiting Teachers\nMessages to the Home\nSources of Strength\nLesson 3Freedom of Choice\nTuesday, December 7, 1943\nFREEDOM of choice develops people, makes them strong and self-reliant. They must think and act for themselves. Free agency is a basic principle in man's development. Without it, he can never reach the high destiny marked out for him. The right to choose his course in life, to say how he will worship and whom, to walk the earth as a free man, are some of the reasons, if not the principal ones, why\n580\nthis great war is being waged. In the august council held in Heaven before the world was framed or man appeared upon its surface, Satan sought to rob us of our agency. He and his followers were defeated, and the forces of righteousness and truth were triumphant. They were victorious in that contest, and they will always ultimately prevail.\nMan's development rests upon his agency. Democratic government is built upon the fundamental idea that men are able to govern themselves, that they are happier when they do it, that no man has the right to govern another man without that man's consent, that enforced obedience is not only contrary to the will and purpose of the Almighty, but contrary to man's highest happiness. If the individual has not the power of choice, if he is denied his agency, how can he be held accountable for something he cannot do? We are given to know right from wrong and are free to choose.\nOur Heavenly Father never resorts to force or compulsion.\nHe'll call, persuade, direct aright, And bless with wisdom, love, and light; In nameless ways be good and kind, But never force the human mind.\nWe all have the right of choice, but when a choice is once made, we are responsible for the consequences.\nThese questions may arise: Why are we subject to temptation? Why is the world made hard? The world is made hard to make men and women strong. It takes rough seas to make good sailors. Without overcoming obstacles, life would be flat, unprofitable, and great quality in character would be impossible.\n\"Who would take adversity from men? He who banishes hardship banishes hardihood, and out of the same door with calamity walks courage and fortitude, triumphant faith, and sacrificial love.\"\nYou remember \"The Two Roads,\" by Jean Paul Richter. This is the story of a boy who dreamed that he was an old man and that he had chosen the wrong road, and he cried in the anguish of his soul for the days of his youth to returnthe days when his father took him to the fork of the roads and told him he had his choice. He explained that one road led into a dark cave where serpents hissed and crawled and where poison flowed instead of water, and the other led into sunny lands where harvests waved and birds sang. In his dream he thought he had taken the wrong road, and his heart was full of remorse. Fortunately it was only a dream. How important it is to make the right choice!\nDiscussion\n1. How is one made strong through making decisions for oneself?\n2. What factors will aid one in choosing aright?\n3. Discuss the quotation: \"The pursuit of easy things makes men weak, while a mastery of the difficult makes men strong.\"\nReferences\nDoctrine and Covenants, Sec. 29:36; 101:78-79 Pearl of Great Price, Moses 4:1-3; 7:32 Discourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925, chapter V, pp. 95-103.

No people have surpassed them in the creation of songs, especially those of a religious type. These Biblical lyrics are to be found mainly in the Old Testament, where they often occur in story settings or are grouped, as in the Psalms, in what we might today call a religious songbook.\nHow shall one distinguish a Bible lyric from the Bible story in which it is sometimes found? It would be rather difficult to do so, if one had only the King James version of the Bible. There, as has been said before, the various literary forms are all cast in a \"chapter and verse\" mold. But take the Modern Reader's Bible, by Dr. R. G. Moulton, or another such volume, The Bible Designed to be Read as Living Literature, by Ernest S. Bates, wherein the Bible is cast in its literary forms, and the lyrics lift into the clear.\nIn the study of the Bible lyric which comes in its story setting, we have a marked advantage. It is like a rose that blooms at the end of a thorny stem. Back of the song is the stirring tale that quickens into lyrical expression at the strategic moment. This is not unlike what occurs in grand opera when the story that is being dramatized rises into such a lyric gem as the \"Jewel Song\" in Faust, the \"Sextet\" in Lucia. Here is one basic difference: the Bible lyric is generally deeply religious in its cast and nature.\nLet us add concreteness to these thoughts with a few typical illustrations:\nMoses has broken the chains of bondage of his oppressed people. Rising in stirring climax, the epic of the Plagues has brought the story to the point when the King, feeling God's wrath in the death of his own son, has set the Israelites free. They\n582\nare on their way to the Promised Land. An army pursues. The waters of the Red Sea have been rolled back, and the people pass through, while the pursuers are drowned in the depths. Up to this point the story is all told in swiftly-moving Biblical prose; but even such expression cannot adequately depict the exultation that sweeps over Israel at its deliverance. It is here that a nation's heart bursts into superb song:\nI will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and my song, And he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: The Lord is his name, Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the Gods? Who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?\n(See Exodus 15:1-17; Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 67-68.)\nThe foregoing quotation is, of course, only part of this stirring lyrical ode. This excerpt, however, reveals something of a Bible song in its story setting.\nAnother lyric of rare artistry, David's Lament, closes the epic of the warrior king of Israel. When the tragic word of the death of Saul, the\nking, and his son Jonathan, David's dearest friend, comes to him, the soul of David is expressed in these lyric lines:\nThy glory, O Israel, Is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty Fallen!\nTell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Askelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\nYe mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, Neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, as of one not anointed with oil.\n\nSaul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.\nYe daughters of Israel, Weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.\nHow are the mighty Fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, Slain upon thy high places.\nI am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love for me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.\nHow are the mighty Fallen! And the weapons of war Perished!\n(See 2 Sam. 1:19-27; Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 281-282.)\nOther well known lyrics woven into the Bible stories are the plea of Ruth, Hannah's song of rejoicing over the birth of Samuel, David's Lament over Absalom.\nBesides these gems of poetry that sparkle in their various settings, there are many beautiful lyrics in the books of prophecy, especially those in Isaiah. Of these more will be said in a later lesson.\nThe Psalms, as already said, are a collection of the songs of Israel. Many of these echo in the hearts of people all over the world, for in their entirety or in part, they are being sung by God-fearing folk everywhere. Eminent literary critics have ranked Psalm Twenty-threeThe Shepherd Psalmas one of the finest lyrics ever created. Its lovely lines have sung solace and faith and trust into the hearts of thousands upon thousands down the years. Observe the sweet cadence and consoling thought as you read aloud these beginning lines:\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me beside the still waters, He restoreth my soul.\nRhythmic beauty is given to the Bible lyric, as shown in this and the other parts of songs quoted in this lesson, by the parallel form in which the songs are cast. Observe that the thought of the lyric is expressed then re-expressed in different words. This is an outstanding characteristic of Hebrew verse. In effect, this repetition not only reimpresses the thought but gives to the lyric a musical beauty and, with the artistic changes in the parallel lines, avoids monotony.\nAnother characteristic of the Bible lyric, which marks indeed all great\n583\nlyrics, is the vividness of word pictures; for example, observe in the lines just quoted what a delightful scene is deftly sketched of a shepherd with his flock. Note also the pictures that come from these expressions, \"swifter than eagles,\" \"stronger than lions,\" \"in scarlet delicately,\" \"passing the love of woman.\"\nA wealth of artistry, with an uplift into things divine, is in the study of the Bible lyric. Our hope is that this lesson may prove an \"open sesame\" to these treasures. It remains for those who study it to carry forward.\nDiscussion and Activities\n1. What is the origin of the word lyric? Name some lyric in the Bible, other than those given in this lesson, which has brought uplift to you.\n2. It has been said that back of every great song lies a story. How is this truth illustrated by some of the lyrics found in the Bible?\n3. What is the main theme of the lyrics created by the Children of Israel? Why?\n4. One poet has said, \"Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.\" Apply this thought to the creation of some Bible lyric; to the negro spirituals; to any other rare lyric.\n5. What is meant by \"parallel verse\"? Illustrate with quotations from one of your favorite psalms. By reading the quotation aloud show the musical effect of the parallel lines.\n6. Find two expressions in some Bible lyric that suggest pictures.\n7. Read aloud all of Psalm 23 or 24, or some other Bible lyric. Note the cadence, the word pictures, the religious uplift that comes from the lyric chosen.\n8. How are Bible lyrics echoed in many of the songs we sing today? Give an illustration.\n\nSocial Science\nNO social science lesson is printed in this issue of the Magazine, as no lesson for this department is planned for the month of December, due to the holiday season.\n\nStories from the Book of Mormon\nNO lesson for this department is printed in this issue of the Magazine, as the General Board does not require that a meeting be held on Tuesday, December 28, due to the holiday season.\n\nERRATUM\nATTENTION is called to an error in the social science lesson, no. 9, in the Augustpage 515, which erroneously names John Marshall as the first Chief Justice of the United States. While John Marshall was the most notable of American jurists and a Chief Justice, John Jay was the first Chief Justice.\n\nEzra Taft Benson Called To The Apostleship\n(Continued from page 531)\nEzra T. Benson has been a consistent and devoted Church member throughout his life. His early activities centered about ward and stake priesthood work, also acting as a scout leader. He spent two years serving as a missionary in England. In 1932, while residing in Boise, he was made superintendent of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association of Boise Stake. Three years later he was chosen to be first counselor in the stake presidency, and, in 1938, he was made president of the Boise Stake in which capacity he served until he moved to Washington, D. C. with his family.\nElder Benson is blessed with a devoted wife who has supported him in all his endeavors. Flora Smith Amussen is the youngest daughter of Utah's pioneer jeweler, Carl Christian Amussen, and Barbara Smith. The Bensons are the parents of five children, Reed A., Mark A., Barbara, Beverly, and Bonnie.\nPresident Benson will assume his new duties following the October conference at which time he will be sustained in his new position."

            "content": "Importance of the Sacrament Meeting\nElder Joseph Fielding Smith Member of the Council of the Twelve\nAT the conclusion of the Passover supper on the night of the betrayal, Jesus introduced the sacrament. It is recorded in Luke:\nAnd he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.\nLikewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.\nIn this manner the sacred and holy ordinance of the sacrament was introduced. This ordinance was not intended merely for the apostles, but for all the members of the Church, and it was the custom of the ancient saints to meet often for this purpose, as they were commanded.\nThen came the days of apostasy when this simple and holy ordinance was turned into a feast which brought from Paul a rebuke because the sacrament had been turned into a supper of revelry and drunkenness. The sacrament is not a \"supper\" although it has become the custom to refer to it as such. In Paul's rebuke and instruction to the Corinthian saints, he said:\nFor I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread:\nAnd when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.\nAfter the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.\nFor as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.\nWherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.\nBut let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.\nPage 589\n590\nFor he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.\nFor this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. (I Cor. 11: 23-30.)\nWhen the Gospel was restored, the Lord commanded the members of the Church to observe this sacred ordinance in all solemnity. In a revelation given on August 7, 1831, He said:\nThou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.\nThou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit.\nAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;\nFor verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High; (D. & C. 59:7-10.)\nThe partaking of these emblems constitutes one of the most holy and sacred ordinances in the Church, an ordinance which has replaced the slaying and eating of the paschal lamb which was typical of the sacrifice upon the cross of our Redeemer, given to Israel in Egypt, and in remembrance of the great sacrifice which was, to them, future. From the time of the exodus from Egypt to the crucifixion of our Redeemer, the Israelites were commanded to observe the passover at a certain time each year. On the solemn night before the crucifixion the Lord changed this ordinance and gave in its stead the sacrament. We have been commanded to meet often, not merely once each year, and go to the house of prayer and there remember our Redeemer and make covenant with\nHim in partaking oft of this holy ordinance.\nThe sacrament meeting is the most sacred and the most important meeting required of all the members of the Church. If any of the members are not in good standing; if they have in their hearts any feeling of hatred, envy, sin of any kind, they should not partake of these emblems. If there are any differences or feelings existing between brethren, these differences should be adjusted before the guilty parties partake; otherwise they will eat and drink unworthily and bring upon them the condemnation spoken of by Paul. We should all see that \"our hearts and ways are clean and pure.\"\nThose members of the Church who habitually absent themselves from the sacrament meeting and who do not enter into the covenants which the sacrament requires of them, are guilty of grievous sin and are under grave condemnation. The Spirit of the Lord cannot dwell in them and they deny to themselves the guidance of that Spirit. Willful and protracted absence is a sign of apostasy, and if persisted in will lead to faultfinding, disagreement with authorities and misunderstanding and criticism of the doctrines of the Church. If such a course is continued, it will lead those who are guilty out of the Church, for the Spirit of the Lord cannot be their companion when they show indifference to this sacred commandment.\nI HAVE often wondered if we fully realize the significance and importance of the covenants we make in partaking of these emblems in remembrance of the body and blood of Jesus Christ. It is our duty to carefully and thoughtfully consider the nature of these prayers when we hear them offered in our meetings. There are four very important things we covenant to do each time we partake of these emblems, and in partaking, there is the token that we subscribe fully to the obligations, and thus they become binding upon us. These are as follows:\n1. We eat in remembrance of the body of Jesus Christ, promising that we will always remember His wounded body slain upon the cross.\n2. We drink in remembrance of the blood which was shed for the sins of the world, which atoned for the transgression of Adam, and which frees us from our own sins on condition of our true repentance.\n3. We covenant that we will be willing to take upon us the name of the Son and always remember Him. In keeping this covenant we promise that we will be called by His name and never do anything that would bring shame or reproach upon that name.\n4. We covenant that we will keep His commandments which He has given us; not one commandment, but that we will be willing to \"live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.\" (D. & C. 84:44.)\nIf we will do these things then we are promised the continual guidance of the Holy Ghost, and if we will not do these things we will not have that guidance.\nAgain, I have wondered how members of the Church can go to the sacrament service and partake of these emblems, and make these solemn covenants, and then immediately after the close of the meeting go out to some place of amusement, to attend a picture show, a baseball game, or some resort, or to gather at some home to play cards. When any of these things is done the guilty person (or persons) violates this sacred covenant so recently made or renewed. Do they who do this pay so little attention to their obligations that they really do not sense their significance? Or do they think that the Lord in His abundant goodness and mercy will overlook their shortcomings, and do they look upon it as being not a very great sin after all to violate covenants made in this manner? Of course, only those who are guilty are able to answer these questions. The fact remains, however, that when we indulge in habits of this kind we are covenant breakers guilty of offenses, as taught by Paul, of the most serious kind.\nBecause of these breaches of the commandments, and the violation of covenants thus solemnly taken, many among us are in the same condition as they were in the days of Paul; they are spiritually sick, weak in the faith, and they sleep the spiritual sleep that leads to death.\nIn offering Himself a sacrifice for sin, our Savior freed the world from the consequences of the transgression of Adam. He was also freeing all men from the consequences of their own sins if they are willing to accept Him as their Redeemer and keep His commandments. It is impossible for weak mortals, and we are all weak, to fully comprehend the extent of the suffering of the Son of God. We cannot realize the price He had to pay. To the Prophet Joseph Smith He said:\nFor behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;\nBut if they would not repent, they must suffer even as I;\nWhich suffering caused myself, even God, the great-\nIMPORTANCE OF THE SACRAMENT MEETING 591\n592\nest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit: and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink\nNevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men; (D. & C. 19:16-19).\nIt is, however, within our grasp to know and realize that this excruciating agony of His sacrifice has brought to us the greatest blessing that could possibly be given. Moreover, we are able to realize that this extreme sufferingwhich was beyond the power of mortal man either to accomplish or endurewas undertaken because of the great love which the Father and the Son had for mankind. We are extremely ungrateful to our Father and to His beloved Son when in all humility with \"broken hearts and contrite spirits\" we are unwilling to keep the commandments. The violation of any divine commandment is a most ungrateful act, considering all that has been accomplished for us through the atonement of our Savior.\nThe lack of faith on the part of the members of the Church is evidenced in the fact that only one, in about four or five on the average, attends this most important meeting, and in the further fact that in so many places the bishops of wards\nseem to think that they have to engage outstanding speakers, and to some extent tickle the ears of the people by speaking and entertainment, at the sacrament services. The primary and outstanding reason why we should attend these services is that we may renew our covenants by partaking of the sacrament. The question, who will speak, is of secondary importance, although it is too frequently considered the first.\nOur faith is always measured by our works. If we fully appreciated the many blessings which are ours through the redemption made for us, there is nothing that the Lord could ask of us that we would not anxiously and willingly do. Why cannot we, today, show forth the faith, and thereby gain the happiness, which was had among the Nephites when it was said of them:\n... They did walk after the commandments which they had received from their Lord and their God, continuing in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft, both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord....\nAnd it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people....\nAnd surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God;..."

            "content": "Periodic Medical Examinations of Apparently Healthy Persons\nH. L. Marshall, M. D. Professor of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Medical School, University of Utah\nHUMAN nature is characterized by many inconsistencies. One of them is the chasm which so often separates knowledge from actionknowing what should be done from actually doing it. Particularly is this often true in the management of our own human mechanism. Fears, prejudices, and indifference are usually stronger than knowledge. It is easier to follow one's feelings than one's reason.\nTwenty years ago a member of the Public Relations Committee of the Pennsylvania Medical Society wrote, \"The proposal that healthy people be examined at regular intervals for the purpose of preventing disease is notable for the logic of its theory and the slowness of its adoption.\"\nIn China it is said to have been a custom for clients to pay a physician regularly for keeping them well, but to stop payment and demand free treatment if the client became sick. In our Anglo-Saxon background the good old English Doctor Dobell suggested, in 1861, that much good could be accomplished and much harm prevented if physicians would carefully examine their patients before, instead of exclusively after, the symptoms of disease appeared.\nIn America, the most sustained attempt to popularize the practice of periodic medical examinations has been that of the organization known as the\nPage 594\nLife Extension Institute. Life insurance companies have been strong supporters of the practice, and some have used it on a large scale. The Army has adopted the practice of yearly examination of all officers, and schools are acting on the idea to an increasing extent. But, for adults in general, practice lags far behind conviction. Therefore, it is worth-while to consider the matter objectively. Mere persuasion offends the intelligence.\nThe human body, considered mechanistically, is an energy-liberating machine. It displays growth, development, and degeneration. It is subject to unfavorable changes of structure and function which lead to disability, pain, and death. These changes we call disease. Except in case of accident or violence, basic changes almost never develop suddenly. They are progressive and, for a considerable time, they usually produce no symptoms of which the person is aware.\nLet us assume that a yardstick divided into thirty-six inches represents the whole process of a chronic (i.e. slow) disease. The left end of the rule marks the very first beginning of the morbid process; the right end marks the termination. Rarely does progress over the first few inches give any symptoms at all. Frequently, two-thirds of the distance may be covered with no symptoms definitely recognized by PERIODIC MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OF APPARENTLY HEALTHY PERSONS the victim. Pain and disturbance of function are often confined to the last few inches. Too often medical contacts center entirely in the last inch. Inferences to be drawn from such knowledge are self-evident and perhaps would not be seriously debatable except at a convention of morons. The logic applies almost equally to a Ford car; however, the difference is that we can get new organs for a Ford when the originals are completely \"shot,\" and, sometimes, we can even turn in the whole flivver on a new car. There are no turn-ins for the human mechanism and very few chances for either new or reconditioned parts. We make the run of life with one machine. It is the only one we have, and no one yet appears to have completed arrangements for another. If this were true of the Ford, how watchful we would be. How often would we have an expert examine itand how careful we would be to take his advice. The teeth represent one of the few \"turn-ins for a new set\" possible in the human body. And yet strangely enough, this is one of the few places where we are nearly all converted to the idea of regular examination before symptoms appear. Stranger still, perhaps, many of us actually live up to the idea in practice. If the process of disease we harbor is not contagious, then the matter is primarily a personal one. At least no one else is definitely endangered. But the process may be communicable (i.e., caused by living organisms which can be transferred from the ailing to the well); for example, tuberculosis and some stages of syphilis 595 . In that case, earliest possible recognition is comparable to detecting a concealed weapon on a gangster before it causes irreparable harm to him and also to his contacts. Obviously, reason and interpretation point to the desirability of careful medical examination of apparently healthy people. Is it possible, we may ask, to substantiate such reasoning by actual accomplishment? Without question it is; although all disease processes cannot yet be recognized in their early stages, and it must be clearly understood that some unforeseen deaths cannot be predicted by any present means at the disposal of medicine. To be specific let us start with the babyeven before it is born. Here the beneficial results of regular medical examination throughout pregnancy are so vitalboth to mother and childthat mere mention of the point is sufficient. Thousands of lives are thereby saved yearly. As for the period of babyhood, the practice of pediatrics (i.e., child specialists) has grown up around -the idea of medical care to prevent rather than exclusively to cure sickness. Formerly the luxury of medical guidance to keep a baby well was practiced only by the rich. Increasingly, it is becoming a routine to people of moderate means, and now in larger centers \"well baby clinics\" serve the poor at nominal cost and the destitute at public expense. In Utah fifty years ago the annual infant mortality rate ranged around 200. This means that one out of every five babies born alive died before reaching its first birthday. Now the infant mortality rate runs 30 to 40. (Continued on page 614) An Appeal to Mothers Bishop Marvin O. Ashton Member of the Presiding Bishopric AN Appeal to You Mothers: As we contemplate the progress this Church is making in its buildings and their upkeep, we are very mindful of the major part you mothers are playing. Yes, in some locallities you are playing the leading role. When you set your mind on a project, things begin to move. If they don't move, you move them. When the United States was at war with Mexico and the Latter-day Saints were asked to raise a battalion, it is reported that Brigham Young said, \"You shall have your battalion, and if there are not young men enough, we will take the old men, and if they are not enough, we will take the women.' Of course, the women didn't have to enlist, but in some of our programs of repairs to our mecting houses, our women do enlist. Women of the Relief Society, we want your help. We want you to insist that your place of worship be kept clean and attractive. We want you to demand of your stake and ward authorities that the buildings and all their facilities be kept just as up to date and clean as your kitchens. Mothers, the buildings where your children worship and where they get religious instruction, and where they are offered recreational opportunities, should be well furnished and up to date. While we appreciate that this is the condition of most of our chapels, there are still some dark corners in some of them that must be cleaned up. If Page 596 you mothers will insist on a clean-up, there will be one. We appeal to you. Expect it and you will get it. The bishop will appreciate your suggestions. 'Tell him what you want, and he will respect your wishes. Sentiment and public opinion are powerful. Here are a few things the mothers of the Church have a right to demand: Custodian _ There should be close cooperation and a feeling of harmony between the custodian and the people of the ward. The custodian should know what the different organizations in the ward require and should cater to their needs, but he has a right to expect proper support from the people. Mothers can help greatly in this respect. Paint It should be understood that tor years the Church has offered to buy the paint if the ward will put it on. No matter how humble a chapel may be, it should be kept well painted inside and out. Landscaping You mothers have a nght to cxpect ward grounds to be well landscaped, where water is available. If water is not availablethese cases are comparatively fewyou have a right to expect that weeds be kept down and dried: grass and debris cleared off. The general appearance of your building should say, \"Come AN APPEAL TO MOTHERS 597 AS WITH THE CHURCH, SO WITH THE PEOPLE Is this just a dream?? In.\" It should appeal and not repel. May we say here very emphatically many Church buildings that now sit on a dry. Sand hill could be made a little garden spot if just a little ingenuity were used to bring water to the spot either by pipes or irrigation ditch. Generally, where there is a will there is a way. Furniture Mothers, if clumsy, roughly hewn benches and furniture are used in your chapel, you ought to sign a Declaration of Independence and have a Boston Tea Party. When the pioneers arrived, they had to do the best they could with what they had, but in these days you have a night to demand that the furniture represent your better selves. Rest Rooms Now we come to a matter in which we want your help in a special way. To be frank, many of these rooms even in our more expensive buildings area disgrace. Some of them show extreme neglect and even abuse. (Continued on page 619) She Is Ours Edith S. Elliott Member of Relief Society General Board DOROTHY C. THORPE beautiful glassware exhibited in the most exclusive stores and shops throughout the nation bearing the trade name of Dorothy C. Thorpe. The better magazines advertise her wares. Newspapers and periodicals quite frequently carty news items of her fascinating art. People of wealth and influence clamor for her work, often requesting her to create special articles for them. One might ask, \"In what particular field of art does she specialize?\" The answer is overwhelming! Besides the glassware mentioned above, she designs and manufactures exquisite articles in linens, cottons, Page 598 MANY of us have admired the metals, laces, and plastics, as well as creating dainty figurines. She designs, decorates, and furnishes to the last detail an individual room or all rooms in private residences. Her boudoirs are of delicate, exquisite beauty. The nurseries that she has done delight children and are a never-ending source of pleasure to adults. When we view the products of her hands we naturally wonder about the artist herself. She was born in a Latter-day Saint home in Salt Lake City. Her parents, George Eustace and Louise Ridges Carpenter, encouraged Dorothy and provided the opportunity for development of her talents in her youth. Some may not know that this parenthood gave to Dorothy a rich heritage. Her father, born in London, was the youngest son of a wealthy Church of England clergyman, Joseph Hatton Carpenter. He enjoyed all of the advantages of a cultured, well-ordered English home. He and his brothers and sisters were given unusually good educations to fit them for the various professions to which they seemed best adapted. Just as the boys were reaching manhood, their father died, leaving an estate to be divided. The oldest brother, Joseph, took his share of the estate and decided that before settling down he would take a trip around the world. He visited the continents of Europe and Africa, sailed up the east coast of Africa, traveling on to the cities of Asia SHE IS OURS 599 GLASS TRAY WITH PLASTIC HANDLES, AND GLASS VASE, DESIGNED BY MRS. THORPE and Australia. From these cities he continued on to South America, and thence to New York City. While there, he met some Latter-day Saints and missionaries en route to Utah from his native homeland. Delighted to see some of his own countrymen and interested in their story of the Prophet Joseph Smith, he decided to accompany the Saints to the Salt Lake Valley and learn more about them and their teachings. Having been raised in a religious home, Joseph was receptive to the Gospel message and was baptized a worthy member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Anxious to share his new-found joy, he wrote to his widowed mother to tell her of his good fortune. She was shocked and grieved over the news. Her first thought was that Joseph had lost his mind, and she immediately set about to do something to rectify his condition. Joseph's brother, George, in the meantime, had decided to take his share of the family fortune and see the world also. When he reached South Africa, he became interested in the beauty and grace of the feathers of the ostrich. At that particular time ostrich plumes were \"highfashioned.\" The selling of them was extremely lucrative, so George purchased an ostrich farm and settled down to his new and fascinating venture. Business was good, and he prospered financially. Eventually, however, he received a letter from his heartbroken mother telling of his brother Joseph's sad fate. She plead with George to bring him home to London where he could be properly hospitalized. George sold his farm and set sail for the United States. Upon his arrival in Salt Lake City, he found Joseph happy and in the best of 600: health. (At the present time he is serving as recorder of the Manti Temple.) The younger Carpenter rejoiced to find his brother perfectly normal and inquired as to the reason of his mother's anxiety. Joseph and his friends explained the Gospel to George, who readily accepted the message and applied for baptism. Imagine Mrs. Carpenter's concern when she learned that her youngest son, so dear to her heart, had likewise joined this unpopular group! George made friends quickly, and was a general favorite among the young people. While living at the home of Parley P. Pratt, he became acquainted with Brother Pratt's granddaughter, Louise Ridges. She was a beautiful and accomplished gitl, Young Carpenter, in due time, fell in love with Louise and made her his bride. Louise Ridges Carpenter also has an interesting background. Besides being the granddaughter of Parley P. Pratt, whose gifts and talents are familiar to Latter-day Saints, she was also the daughter of Joseph P. Ridges, formerly of England and Australia, who built the original Tabernacle organ. She could tell man interesting tales of the building of that great organ and laughingly claimed a hand in its completion. Her mother, Agatha Pratt Ridges, made the glue that was used to fit the organ pipes together. She followed a recipe furnished by her husband, the main ingredients of which were horse and cow hoofs. The glue had to simmer and stew for quite a long period on the back of the Ridges' stove, and the smell was extremely offensive; but because they couldn't make the glue without the odor, the Ridges family accepted the ordeal and kept the pot constantly hot. The glue had to be carried to the Tabernacle hot or it wouldn't stick properly. It was the duty of little Louise to make many trips to the Tabernacle to deliver the hot glue to her father. Every time she took him his lunch pail, a bucket of glue accompanied it. George and Louise were a happy young couple. 'The young Mrs. Carpenter made a charming home for them. She was artistic, intelligent, resourceful, and energeticall qualities that make for ideal home management. Soon after the birth of their first child, a daughter Florence, George Carpenter was called on a mission to England. After making plans for the care of his lovely wife and daughter during his absence, he left for his homeland. With gratitude in his heart that his call was to England, he eagerly looked forward to receiving a warm welcome at his mother's home. He was overjoyed at the thought of teaching the Gospel in person to his family and friends. Naturally, his first call was at his mother's home. The door was closed against him. His mother later consented to meet him in a secluded section of a public park. She arrived in her elegant carriage with the shades drawn so that no one would recognize her. She admitted George to the carriage and ordered it driven along unfrequented lanes. She told him that he had humiliated and disgraced his family by joining the Mormon Church, and plead with him to renounce his membership. She begged him to desert his wife and baby, give up proselyting, and to SHE lS OURS stay in England among his kin. But George was true to his convictions. Despite the tug of family ties and temptations, he finished his mission, was honorably released, and returned to Zion. George was a gifted writer. He was city editor of the Deseret News for a number of years, and wrote for several magazines and periodicals under the nom de plume of \"Jack Plane.\" As the motion picture industry developed, Mr. Carpenter became interested in the film exchange business which later led him into the management of the Paramount Theater in Salt Lake City, which position he held until shortly before his death. One may wonder what the above recital has to do with the story of Dorothy C. Thorpe. It merely acquaints one with the kind of ancestry from which she comes. The cultured, refined, educated, talented blood of the Carpenters and the Ridges, plus the hardy, intelligent, gifted qualities of the pioneer Pratt family, have produced a genius like Dorothy. She has been aware of her talents and has never \"hidden them under a bushel.\" DOROTHY is the second child in a family of five children. When very young her parents noted that she was artistic and creative. She loved music, rhythm, color, and graceful lines. She liked to sew for her dolls, and she displayed unusual skill for a child. When only twelve years old, she designed and made a complete wardrobe for her doll which took eight first prizes in the Utah State Fair. Every year from then on she entered lovely bits of 601 DECORATIVE PIECE BY MRS. THORPE her handiwork in the Fair. Without exception each entry won a blue ribbon. Along with her creative ability and flare for design, she studied piano under the master teacher John J. McClellan. She loved melody, thythm, harmony, piano technique. She was an outstanding pupil and became an excellent concert pianist. Part of her musical education was under Professor Syler of Los Angeles. Along with the artistic hobbies that she followed, she found plenty of time to attend to her Church duties. She gave generously of her musical talent in accompaniment and piano solos. At the old L. D. S. High School, Dorothy Carpenter was an outstanding student scholastically as well as in her art classes. When Dorothy became too old to sew for dolls she transferred her interest in sewing for them to sewing 602 COMPLETE TABLE ENSEMBLE DESIGNED BY DOROTHY THORPE for her little sister Afton, who is now the wife of Bishop Frank Armstrong of Cottonwood Ward. Afton was like a beautiful dream child. She had naturally curly golden-blonde hair, big blue eyes, and fair smooth skin. Since nature had been so kind to her, Dorothy made it her pleasure to see that her clothing matched her beauty. Without being extravagant, she made exquisite lingerie for Afton. She scalloped the necks and ruffles of her little slips, and added touches of lace or ribbon in just the right places. The dresses, whether for play or best, were meticulously made and clever in design. She enjoyed visits to her sister Florence's home in Los Angeles, where she met and later married George A. Thorpe, a widower with a small son, Kelly. She won the love and affection of the little boy as well as his father. When her own son, Dick, was born, she expressed gratitude that he had such a fine big brother. Life moved on smoothly for the Thorpes. Mr. Thorpe had a splendid stock and bond business, with an income sufficient to make living interesting and progressive. It probably would have remained so had not the depression years undermined George's business. The family budget had to be trimmed many times until George's anxiety fostered a desire. In Dorothy to see if she could help. Naturally, she turned to her art and craft hobbies. She wrapped drinking glasses with bright colored raffia, shellacked the wrappings and achieved attractive beverage glasses. 'These she timidly took to a buyer in one of the Los Angeles department stores to see if she could interest him in selling such articles in his store. The buyer recognized a good saleable article and gave her an order. The glasses were popular, and the demand increased so rapidly that she had to get help from other members of her family living near by. This one idea led to others. She numbered glasses, monogrammed them, banded them with sterling silver. Each new creation met with immediate success until the business spread from the house into the garage, and finally to a factory. She added variety to her stock. Individual special orders began pouring in asking for complete dinner or luncheon sets. Ofttimes the table linen on hand didn't seem appropriate for the setting of the dishes, so she called into use her knowledge of needlework and made dinner and luncheon cloths and napkins to harmonize with the dishes. Orders became so numerous that SHE IS OURS she soon had to enlarge her factory personnel beyond the members of her immediate family. Since then she has gathered into her business Old and New World artisans whose loyalty to her can only be explained by really knowing Mrs. Thorpe. She is modest and unassuming and is willing to share her success with every member of her company. She is appreciative of their efforts and ability. Many of these persons she has trained herself, and she gets a personal pleasure from their achievements. ON E of the outstanding characteristics of Mrs. Thorpe is her spirituality. She has expressed on many occasions that she has had help and inspiration from her Heavenly Father, and feels His nearness in helping to solve problems that naturally appear in any modern business. She writes, \"There have been so many proofs of God's care and nearness in our work. How else were all these wonderful peopleour co-workers put in contact with us? There is our talented Mexican boy sand carver; Charlotte, the charming little French girl, whom I had never seen until she approached me one day in a large Los Angeles department store. Her magic fingers execute miracles of beauty in needlework. She and her family make all of our table linens, lamp shades, draperies, bedspreads, and occasional items. 'Then there is Mr. Ardron, a genius with plastics who knew absolutely nothing about the material until he worked out the first few pieces for us. He has now made such a study of plastics that I feel he leads the profession in his type of work. Also, there is the German ceramic artist who paints designs on glass and china with such 603 LAMP BASE AND SHADE DESIGNED BY DOROTHY THORPE perfection. 'There are lovely girls in the retail shop, from Bernice, the little colored stock girl, to Ann, the gracious manager, who every day is making new-friends for all of us due to her fineness and sincerity. The factory and office workers give 100 per cent efficiency and loyalty. So much credit goes to my beloved stepson, Kelly, who is now in Africa serving his country. For the past few years he has been traveling from one end of the country to the other as the factory representative, as did also my young brother Guy. Why, about a year ago before there were many shortages and lack of workers, did Miss Milba Lloyd, the capable English sculptress, come into my office and make such a fair proposition that it was possible to employ her? I am sure it was again the guiding hand of our Father in Heaven.\" Mrs. Thorpe constantly expresses appreciation for her husband who has caught the spirit of her work and encourages her and delights in her success. He carries all the business and financial responsibilities, leaving Dorothy free to revel in her creative efforts. His kindness, consideration, and understanding enable them to work closely together. Dorothy is lovely in appearance. She is tall with dark hair and eyes and is fastidious in dress. There is a friendliness about her that puts even strangers at ease. She is quick to recognize ability in others and is willing to lend a helping hand. Some few years ago she had a friend who designed and manufactured children's clothes. This friend was anxious to get her merchandise on the Los Angeles market. She wrote to Mrs. Thorpe to ask her if, without any embarrassment or inconvenience, she could introduce her to the buyer in the children's department of the most exclusive department store in Los Angeles where Mrs. Thorpe's fine handwork was retailed. A letter came back via air mail saying, \"Call me as soon as you arrive in Los Angeles, and I will be happy to make the appointment for you and help in any way I can.\" In the same letter she expressed joy in knowing of the friend's plans. She told how thrilling it was to her to encourage someone beginning in the creative field. \"Because,\" she continued, \"my work hasn't been all smooth sailing and without the help of friends and the Great Creator Himself, I wouldn't have attained such success. Then, too, I feel that anyone who can create in a small way, has something akin to that Great Creator.\" Just before the present world war Mrs. Thorpe went on a business trip to Europe. She hoped to gain inspiration and new ideas from Old World treasures. She also hoped to establish a European business whereby she could have beautiful, finished articles made by Old World craftsmen according to her designs, shipped to her Los Angeles office, bearing the label \"Made in (name of country) exclusively for Dorothy C. Thorpe.\" Being internationally known, her trip was made easy and interesting by European dealers and producers, as well as by connoisseurs of her art. Unfortunately, the war intervened and her venture had to be postponed until some future date. Not discouraged by the turn of affairs, she returned home sparkling with new ideas that could be realized in her own country. Mrs. Thorpe works out special orders for such well-known people as Ginger Rogers, Laraine Day, William Powell, Andy, of Amos and Andy fame, Clark Gable, the Duchess of Windsor, Leopold Stokowski, and many others. She is listed in Who's Who in American Art. She enjoys the friendship and esteem of fellow artisans. One of her greatest personal joys has been in the achievement of her two brothers. Both have been motion picture set designers. Guy left the business to act as an able factory representative for his sister. Claude has remained at R. K. O. where he is first assistant set decorator. Dorothy's love and interest in her sister Afton is a loving example of affection. She is proud of Afton's beautiful home in Cottonwood. Afton is also blessed with artistic talents.\n SHE IS OURS 605\nDOROTHY THORPE'S SHOP IN MAY COMPANY, WILSHIRE BLVD., LOS ANGELES\nThroughout her home are evidences of her fine needlework in linens, curtains, draperies, hooked rugs, etc. Also the color combinations of her home are restful and appropriate. When Mrs. Thorpe was asked for pictures to accompany this article, she wrote, \"In my opinion the Latter-day Saint Relief Society is one of the world's outstanding organizations, and we will be very proud indeed to have your Magazine publish an article on our work.\" This brief biography about one so worthy of recognition has been a pleasure to prepare. Dorothy Thorpe has risen high in her field, and we are proud that she is ours."

When day is done, I dress myself in colored streamers From the setting sun and veil of evening's mist. Along the milky way in silver ship of clouds I sail away to bathe my soul In sea of stars and magic of the moon. Then travel down the Lethe River of the dark; To sleepto dreamto wait The coming of another morn.\nL. D. S. Girls and Women in Wartime Elder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union\nWITH the call of young men of superior physical fitness to the armed forces for defense of their country against aggression, there goes very naturally an obligation on the part of women to give them all the aid and comfort that is within their power properly to give. Some of the younger women do this by enlisting as army nurses; others enlist in other branches of the service where women can be most helpful in support of the enlisted men. All of this is a very necessary and patriotic service when performed in ways that contribute not only to the physical welfare and morale of the men but also uphold the highest standards of moral and spiritual welfare. Otherwise, the association of women with the armed forces becomes a moral menace to both men and women, often bringing in its trail loathsome diseases that have proved to be one of the greatest liabilities to the successful prosecution of the war. This, however, damaging as it is, is a minor factor compared with the dire consequences both physical and moral, that follow for years or even for generations after the war has been won or lost. These conditions apply with equal force to girls and women who have no official connection with the fighting forces. Girls in their teens are\nPage 606\nentitled to the guardianship of parents, whose sympathy and wider experience should shield their girls from the temptations that all too often lead to the downfall of minors who are attracted by the glamour of military uniforms. This is not to infer that generally, men in uniform would take advantage of innocent girls but experience has shown that there are some who would do so. Girls associating with men who are strangers to them may at any time find themselves the objects of lust that may result in lifelong sorrow. The finest prospects for a happy and useful life may be ruined in a very brief time. This is the dark side of the picture. What of the bright side? There are in the military forces many fine young men; men fit to be the husbands of women of the purest minds and chaste lives. Should not all L. D. S. Women do everything within their power to help these young men to come out of their severe and trying experiences as sound in morals and religion as they were when they entered the service? Evidently it is their religious and patriotic obligation to do this; and also to protect themselves from becoming objects of the lust of men of loose morals. This also is a great service to their Church and their country.\n(Continued on page 650)"

Cannon\nMADAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK, America's recent guest who won the nation's heart, will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the great women of all time. So many qualities are merged into resultant greatness that analysis is difficult, yet in Madame Chiang's case perhaps one of the most important elements is her power of blending and harmonizing. She has taken the best of the wonderful Oriental culture of antiquity and the best of the modern Western culture and blended them into a workable philosophy of life. She has used the wisdom of the old proverbs as motivation for quick action in the life of today. She has harmonized elements that seem incongruous into a smooth, sane pattern of living. For example, although the world regards her as a leading feminist, yet the Chinese people think of her and her two sisters as \"pearls among women\" because they are \"husband-helpers,\" and \"how could praise go higher?\" Again, Madame Chiang has a deep faith in God, yet she believes that truest inspiration comes by exerting also her own mind to its fullest capabilities, and letting the All-wise work through and upon her own best intelligence. A brief sketch of the background of the Soongs is necessary to understand the work of Mayling, wife of China's Generalissimo. Destiny must have had a hand in the birth of the children. According to the delightful book, The Soong Sisters, by Emily Hahn, destiny made a twofold contribution. First, both parents were Christians; also, both parents were extraordinarily progressive, forward-looking, and fearless. If either one had been of the conservative type and had held the other back, the Soong sisters whom we know would not have emerged, and China would be a different country today. Mrs. Soong was a descendant of the illustrious Wen Ting-kung, who, eighteen generations ago, became one of the first Chinese Christians. He established the tradition, which was maintained throughout succeeding generations, that children should be treated alike, regardless of sex. (In Wen's time girl babies were not infrequently cast into the rivers.) Mrs. Soong herself received an excellent education. She bore six children, and had a talent for administration in the home and in business. She helped her husband, who was working day and night to further the Revolution under Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and she gave to the poor, and was a patron of schools and churches. Through her good management, the family lived in happiness and comfort, even though she was a stern disciplinarian. Mr. Soong, the father, was sent by his parents to Boston at the age of nine, to help his uncle, a shopkeeper, in a Chinese store. For three years the little boy stood behind a counter, went to night school, and longed for a first-class education. Then he stowed away on a cutter bound for the South. The captain, Charles Jones, befriended and con-\nPage 607\nverted him to Christianity. The boy was christened Charles Jones Soong. After five years of preparatory and college work, he returned to Shanghai as a missionary teacher. Gradually, however, he drifted into industry, and married.\nTHE three sons, T. V., T. L., and T. A. Soong, are among China's most outstanding men today. The three daughters are named Eling (Loving Years), Chingling (Happy Years), and Mayling (Beautiful Years). Some prefer the translation \"youth\" to \"years.\" At home, the little girls learned to do fine needlework, and to cook Chinese and American fashion. They learned English at Miss Richardson's Methodist school. The school was very advanced for five-year-old Mayling, and she would wake up at nights in fits of trembling. Standing straight on the floor, she would repeat her lessons. Wisely, she was taken home, where she worked with a tutor until she left for America at the age of nine. The three sisters went abroad before their brothers did. Eling was the first to go, and Shanghai received a fresh shock at the behavior of Charlie Soong's family. The idea of a father's spending on a girl all that money that ought to go into her dowry! And then the girl would come home with dangerous, newfangled ideas. Two good reasons why no man would ever want to marry her. The sisters, however, were very happy in the Wesleyan College for Women, in Macon, Georgia. They acquired charming voices and accents, and made many good friends among American students. Their parents sent them bolts of exquisite Chinese silks, which were the envy of the school. Mayling, too young for regular work, was permitted to live on the campus and have special work. She was pert and had a quick wit, and a quick temper. In 1913, Mayling enrolled in Wellesley College, where she majored in English literature, minored in philosophy, and studied science and music. She was chosen a \"Durant Scholar,\" the highest academic distinction the college awarded. When Mayling returned to Shanghai, she had a struggle to adjust herself. With a tutor, she studied the intricacies of Chinese language and literature. She broke precedents as Eling had done, who, after marrying the wealthy Dr. Kung, actually appeared in her husband's Christian school for men and taught the classes herself, when the American teacher failed to arrive. Mayling did social work with the Y. W. C. A., and became a member of the National Film Censorship Committee, and of the Child Labor Commission. She was shocked at the labor conditions in factories. Chingling married Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who was a frequent visitor in the home of Charlie Soong. She went through the trials and dangers of the Revolution with him. One of his chief supporters was Chiang Kai-shek, who, divorced, fell in love with Mayling. He waited ten years for her and, in the meantime, studied Christianity, principally through Mrs. Soong. Two years after his marriage he was baptized. Mayling went with the Generalissimo to live in Nanking, with its squalor and emptiness. Other officers' wives re-\n\nMADAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK\nmained in Shanghai, but Mayling went to work with her husband. She started schools for children of the Revolution, and saw that they were taught to use their hands and their bodies, and to reason why things should be done. They learned to use their initiative instead of depending on regimentation. Madame Chiang found that the officers waiting in Nanking for orders were restive. They had nothing to do. So she gathered help and organized the Officers' Moral Endeavor Association, which cultivated art, music, drama, and sociability. The Association supplied posters for propaganda, scenery for plays, and decorations for public buildings. The Generalissimo was struggling for the unification of China under a constitutional government. He had separated from Sun Yat-sen and his communistic regime. Chiang wanted social changes, but of a milder form. Although the three sisters were married to men representing three opposing schools of thoughtDr. Sun, the communistic, Dr. Kung, the capitalistic, and the Generalissimo, the liberalfamily loyalty was so strong that their friendship remained firm. All were working, too, in their own ways, for the betterment of China. Wherever her husband went on his campaigns, Mayling accompanied him, living in icy cold shacks with no comforts, but always carrying curtains and flower bowls, and personally scrubbing floors and tables. She was fighting a revolution against dirt and sloth, and the idea that upper-class Chinese women \"lose face\" if they use a dustcloth or a broom.\n609\nAnother project of Madame Chiang's was to promote, by speeches and otherwise, her husband's New Life Movement, based upon propriety, justice, integrity, and conscientiousness. Spiritual reform is its aim. One must discriminate clearly between what is his own and what is not his own, and must not take what does not belong to him. Degrading the personality by stealing, matters much; dying of hunger is not important. The movement aims at modesty and economy in dress, cleanliness, moderation, and the improvement of table manners. Accompanying her husband on tours through China's Northwest and West, Mayling addressed the leading women everywhere, begging that they sense social responsibility and cooperate in fighting the menaces of dirt, poverty, disease, and particularly opium. As leaders, she appointed the wives of leading officials. She told the school girls that the uneducated did not know how to organize; that when they met, they chattered about everything except the subject in hand and that the educated had a great responsibility to learn to teach and to organize. When her husband was kidnapped by his opponents, Madame Chiang, against advice, flew to him, and was admitted to his cell. He was troubled, humiliated, and suffering from injuries. She read the Psalms to him until he fell into a much needed slumber.\nNo sooner had Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek attained success in uniting China, than the Japanese began their undeclared war. Madame Chiang's task now became\n\nherculean. All three Soong sisters worked unitedly and individually to save China, giving both of their talents and private means. Mayling helped Eling (Madame Kung) with the establishment and direction of mobile industrial cooperatives, using light machinery for quick evacuation. Eling hoped the cooperative system might be the answer to the struggle between capital and labor. The sisters also gave themselves to the raising of funds and the swift organizing of hospitals and war orphanages for the many, many thousands of wounded and bereft. Madame Chiang established a training school for select young women. Conditions were very sanitarydishes were passed through three rinse waters. The girls were to teach in other training schools whose students would teach the peasant women better methods of farming, prevention of disease, and also the three \"R's.\" Madame Chiang herself talked to the girls daily; her intensity fired one of the most sheltered groups of young women in the world with the zeal to change themselves into what Madame wished them to become. Mayling Chiang was Secretary General of the Aeronautic Commission. She started her aviators from the field, watched the fighting from the hills, and welcomed those who came back. Overcrowded, however, with duties, she eventually gave this up. Madame Chiang's mind is sharp and clean-cutting as a razor. Her scholarship is amazing. Her large, accurate vocabulary is enough to send most American women scurrying to the dictionary; yet, when she addresses children, her style is simple and graphic. Years ago she told America that Japan would bring war to her doorstep. Before the Canadian Parliament, she traced minutely the growth of Anglo-Saxon institutions, and contrasted parliamentary government with axis tyranny. In her Wellesley speech of 1942 she followed the growth of feminism throughout the world, and showed that women \"have had a share in the ever-ascending pyramid of civilization.\" Again she stressed the obligation of the educated and able to minister to humanity. High thinking, translated into deeds which bring about human progress, is what differentiates men from beasts, she commented, pointing out also that the group accomplishes far more than the individual. Humility, also, she laudedthe insistent desire to learn from all sources. Herein she divulged secrets of her own successputting her vast knowledge to practical useskillfully organizing groups, carefully teaching them, and always learning more herself. Madame Chiang has given away another secretthe source of her power to inspire. It lies in her confession of faith. At home her mother has prayed for her children\"not a five-minute prayer to bless her child and grant her request. It meant 'waiting upon God until she felt His leading.\" After her mother's death, Mayling had to pray herself through things. She needed a source of strength greater than her own. \"When I talk with God, He lifts me up where I can see clearly.\" God is always there, accessible, but one must strive for the presence of God\n(Continued on page 625)"

Cannon\nIN Latin American countries many women of old aristocratic families are emerging from the seclusion of home and church to become pioneers in the advanced social changes sweeping the nations. Also, the large middle class developing from increased industry is helping to build a new civilization with unforeseen opportunities for the masses. Education has become compulsory in most of the countries. Some years ago, women above the very poor classes felt that housework was degrading. Today, Puerto Rico has an excellent modern school of domestic science. The Nicaraguans have erected a statue to Mrs. Josefa de Aguirre, a beloved educator of girls and an author. The vacation colonies and nursery schools of Peru were instituted by the wife of a former president.\nMRS. BURTON W. MUSSER of Salt Lake City, a United States delegate to two Pan-American conferences, says that the favorite accomplishment of a woman mayor in Chile is a housing project for workers, and a community restaurant where undernourished children are fed daily, and where workers obtain a noon-time meal at cost. She notes that the outstanding welfare projects of Argentina are under the administration of a woman, and that in Uruguay a woman physician stands at the head of all the child-welfare program, which includes education as well as health and other phases of child-welfare work. The wife of President Lopez of Columbia worked successfully for ideal institutional care for 1800 orphans and underprivileged children.\nTHE women of the little Dominican Republic voted in the presidential election of 1942; and in Cuba, Brazil, El Salvador, and Uruguay complete woman suffrage is enjoyed.\nIN the fields of medicine, law, art, sculpture, and literature women are proving very successful. The Chilean poet, Gabriela Mistral, who writes on many subjects other than \"love remembered or desired\" has won international recognition. Dr. Bertha Lutz of Brazil is an authentic scientist as well as an internationally known feminist. Many thousands of our good neighbor women are engaged in various types of Red Cross and war work. With all these new activities, the women of Latin America still retain their graciousness and charm.\nUNION of the Women of the Americas now exists. One aim of the organization is to detect and eradicate enemy influence in the various countries. The Union's emblem represents the American continent with no dividing lines.

            "content": "Spiritual Strength Through Sabbath Observance\nMAN is so constituted that his spiritual needs must be ministered unto even as are his physical needs; otherwise, he becomes unequal to meet with full vigor the problems of life. President Joseph F. Smith declared: \"Many people are inconsistent in that they study concerning the needs of the body, and observe strictly the laws of health, yet they disregard the equally urgent needs of the spirit. For the spirit, as well as the body, needs food.\" (Gospel Doctrine, p. 262.)\nWe all recognize that there are times when pronounced strains placed upon the body make it necessary for us to give special attention to our physical well-being. So, too, there are times when the spirit of man needs special attention in order that it will be sufficiently strong to withstand unusual circumstances. Such times are upon us today. Anxiety, sorrow, and mourning are the present lot of mankind, and only those who are spiritually strong can be expected to triumph.\n\"But,\" we ask, \"how may one grow strong in spirit? What are the foods which nourish this part of man?\" President Joseph F. Smith gives answer in these words: \"It is the purpose of the Gospel and the holy Priesthood... to benefit mankind spiritually...\" (Gospel Doctrine, p. 261.) He further states that the Lord designed that the Latter-day Saint people should become the rich-\nPage 612\nest of all people in heavenly giftsin spiritual blessings. We must remember, however, that even though the richest of spiritual blessings are designed for Latter-day Saints, they will not come to us, as individuals, through inertia or indifferencethey will come only as the result of faithfulness and diligence. They come through knowledge and obedience, sacrifice and service. They come through keeping ourselves attuned to the mind and will of the Father.\nThe Father has commanded us to \"remember the Sabbath Day and keep it holy.\" He has also told us through modern revelation: \"It is expedient that the Church meet together often and partake of bread and wine in remembrance of the Lord Jesus\" (Doc. & Cov. 20:75). \"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day\" (Doc. & Cov. 59:9).\nObedience to these commandments brings a pronounced renewal of both physical and spiritual strength. The week days of the average individual today are crowded with new and unusual tasks. The great majority of us are overworked. How easy it is, particularly for mothers who during week days are employed outside the home, to leave for the Sabbath Day odd jobs that they have been too busy to attend to on other days. Because the work demands of week days are so strenuous, they feel justified in using the Sabbath as a day for catching up on undone work, rather than as a day of rest and worship. But there is no excuse for robbing the Lord's day of its sanctity. Work should be so planned and affairs so managed that on the Sabbath we may lay aside our week-day tasks, pay our devotions to our Heavenly Father, and obtain needed physical and spiritual refreshment.\nTo attend sacrament meeting on the Sabbath should be regarded by Latter-day Saints not as a burdensome requirement, but as a glorious privilege. The sacrament meeting provides opportunity for us to partake of the sacrament, thereby renewing our covenants with our Heavenly Father and testifying that we are willing to serve Him and keep His commandments; it is a period wherein we may worship the Father in humility and prayer; it is an hour of repentance, and a time for meditation upon God's great plan of life and salvation. A proper observance of the duties and devotions of the Sabbath Day will give us the best rest that we can obtain, as well as a great renewal of spiritual strength.B. S. S.\nMarianne C. Sharp Appointed Associate Editor ofContinued from page 593)\nshe majored in ancient languages, and was graduated with High Honors. In her senior year she was given a teaching fellowship in Latin and continued teaching Latin at the University and Stewart Training School after graduation.\nMrs. Sharp is a staunch, orthodox Latter-day Saint. She knows and understands the doctrines of the Church and is obedient to Church teachings. She has been active in Church auxiliary work, having taught in the Sunday School and Primary organizations, and for one year she served as chairman of the Queen's Branch, New York, Genealogical Committee. She is thoroughly familiar with all phases of Relief Society work. While living in New York for a period of eleven years, she served continuously in the Relief Society, first as literature and theology class leader and then as president of the Queen's Branch Society. Later, when New York Stake was created, she served on the Relief Society stake board and as counselor to President Lorena Fletcher. She also represented Relief Society on the National Woman's Radio Committee.\nAfter returning to Utah from New York, she continued her Relief Society work as literature class leader in the Twentieth Ward of Ensign Stake until she was called to be a member of the General Board.\nMrs. Sharp has a fine intellect, discriminating judgment, and excellent literary taste. She is sensitive to the reading interests and needs of Latter-day Saint women, and meticulous in the preparation of Magazine material. She is willing to work long and hard to maintain high standards of excellence. Her husband and her young daughters, Luacine, Louise, and Annetta, are interested in her work and fully cooperate with her. Mrs. Sharp assumes her duties well-equipped to carry the responsible position of associate editor of ThePeriodic Medical Examinations of Apparently Healthy Persons\n(Continued from page 595)\nMedical guidance of apparently well babies is an important factor in this result. Childhood, especially early childhood, is the time when most developmental defects appear: diseased tonsils, obstructing adenoids, tooth decay, ear trouble, defects of vision, speech abnormalities, damage to the heart valves, emotional difficulties, and many others. Surveys show that millions of American children suffer from one or more of these conditions. If discovered early, nearly all can be improved, and many of them can be entirely relieved before lifelong handicaps result; but not if medical contacts are withheld until compelling symptoms appear.\nEarly adult life is the period when tuberculosis and the venereal diseases take their heaviest toll. The chances for salvaging the individual and for almost every form of protection for others, center on finding the cases earlyi. e., discovery before they give symptoms. Intensive search for tuberculosis among groups of apparently well people usually reveals from five to ten times the number of cases previously known to exist. And the importance of examining the apparently well for the discovery of syphilis is attested by our recent premarital laws.\nWhen we come to the period of middle and later life it is well to face squarely the fact that medical effort is often a compromise with more or less damaged goods. But there is all the more reason for early examination and guidance. Here the analogy of the yardstick is particularly helpful. The last inch is a poor time on which to concentrate the medical contacts. Some degenerative processes and malignant changes, even when recognized, are difficult to influence, yet there is ample evidence of the high value of early recognition in adding years of comfort and efficiency. Fifty per cent of groups made up of individuals with hypertension (high blood pressure) have shown an average reduction of 18 M. M. under medical guidance. This has meaning when we remember that according to the American Actuarial Society, a reduction of 10 M. M. of hypertension in the age group 40 to 49 decreases the chances of dying by more than one-third.\nThe practice of periodic medical examination is no panacea. But to say that it is highly desirable is a conservative understatement provided: One's physician is really interested and skillful in this type of work; And provided the person examined follows advice without becoming fussy or developing apprehensiveness."

            "content": "The Gracious Years Kathleen B. Nelson\nRHEA CALVERT'S home was charming. Each detail of her spacious living room had been chosen with a careful discernment. Rhea, herself, was charming too in her wayher hair smartly styled and the pale linen dress she wore exactly suitable for that particular hour at home. Rhea had given all of her mature life to acquiring a background of cultured ease. Her husband had made money and she had made use of it. Now widowed for several years, she gave all of her time to her particular social set. Not until recently had she entertained even a vague doubt that hers was not an important contribution to the world's well-being. And now this doubt was driving her to an almost frenzied justification of her way of life.\nToday she had two callers, but they were not enjoying themselves. In spite of the comfortable cool room and the dainty food on the coffee table, they sat on the edge of their chairs as though poised for a chance to break away. Rhea's monologue like a fast-revolving door kept them fixed. Her voice had caught in a fretful groove and was spinning on in a long recital of grievances suffered from the butcher, the baker, and even the candlestick maker. Then there was the recurrent refrain, \"Nobody knows the trouble I have.\"\nMaude, Rhea's sister, was frankly impatient, and Laura, her mind on her own work of locating missing soldiers for their families, was frankly inattentive. To have so many grievances and nobody really eager to listen to them was trial enough. It made Rhea more than ever vociferous. \"And after all my trouble of getting help and food and cars, half of the crowd say that they can't go. Just like that. They can't go! What about me! You'd think they'd have a little consideration\"\nMaude broke in here, \"Now Rhea, this is no year for big house parties.\"\n\"But it's just our crowd. I've had them for so many years. I just can't give it up.\"\n\"Face the facts. There isn't any crowd. Four or five useless card-playing women.\"\n\"Being my sister does not give you the right to insult my friends.\" Rhea spoke from a lofty height, but Maude brushed it off with an affectionate pat.\n\"I haven't a thing against any of them Re, but I hate to leave you here moping and I've got to get back to work. Shall we go, Laura?\"\n\"Yes. I must.\" The two women hurried away but Rhea's wail, \"But you haven't told me what to do,\" followed them to the door.\n\"Crochet a bedspread.\" Maude suggested glibly, but Laura's advice though given hurriedly had more thought and warmth behind it. \"Get a job, Rhea. Good ones are going begging.\"\n\"Me a job?\" Rhea asked herself. Did Laura mean it or was she just being superior? How could she work? Why she\nPage 615\nwas over forty-five. These were her gracious years. Sometimes little things get stuck in the brain. So that phrase, \"the gracious years,\" had stuck in Rhea's. It was a speaker referring to a woman's middle age, and he had called those in-between years \"the gracious years.\" A beautiful moment in time that could be held indefinitely so long as health remained. Rhea had loved the idea so much that it had become her goalthose long, extended gracious years. Her own conception pictured herself in a series of dramatic hostess gowns, always the center of a crowd of enchanted friends. Ah lovely dream! Imagine if she should start to work what would become of her ideal of beautiful middle age. It was too pitiful.\n\"No one understands me. No one appreciates me,\" Rhea thought rebelliously. It was some minutes before, overcome with self-pity, she decided to call the doctor to verify her own opinion that she was not strong enough to work. The doctor would build up her self-esteem, and a little talk with him would be a moment's escape from a situation that she did not like to face. Really she was not well! Thinking about it made her certain of an illness. She did not sleep very much after an evening's excitement. Besides what of those moments of sheer revelation when things around her took on strange new meanings? She must speak to the doctor about that. It might be psychopathic. Being a rich widow approaching fifty gave one some privileges with a doctor's time. Besides Clint was an old friend of her late husband. She knew he'd be stern at the mere idea of her working. Well she'd call him anyway, and that would end the job business. If she believed in anything she believed in obeying her doctor's orders. She dialed the number and almost on the instant a crisply efficient voice answered, \"Dr. Clinton's office.\"\n\"May I speak to Dr. Clinton?\"\n\"Sorry. The doctor is busy.\"\n\"But I must speak to him. This is Mrs. Calvert. I'm an old friend. I'm not just one of his patients. I Yes, I'll hold the line.\"\nShe had to wait a long time before a voice snapped at her, \"Yes?\"\n\"Oh, Clint,\" she began in a leisurely conversational tone, \"How are you? This is Rhea. Yes, Rhea. I had a little time and I thought I'd call you. Yes, yes, of course it's a professional call. You know last week when I came in to be checked and you didn't find anything wrong? Well, since then I remember I didn't tell you everything. You know I'm always gettingWhat's that? Come in next week and see you? But I have something to ask you now. Yes, yes. Wait a minute, Clint. It's important. Do you think it would hurt me to work? Yes, to work. Why should it? Well, I don't know, only I thought perhaps at my age.... You say you're ten years older than I am and now you're having to work harder than you ever did? Well really, what has that to do with me.?\"\n\"Nothing, Rhea, only everybody else is working, and I can't see why you should be in a class by yourself. Besides, those crowds you wait on at your summer place every yearIf that isn't work, what is it? I mean, if you can stand that you can stand anything.\"\n\nTHE GRACIOUS YEARS\nRhea's voice thinned to a pathetic waver, \"Well, what kind of work do you think?\"\n\"I am a doctor Rhea, not a vocational guidance man. Good-by.\"\nThis was certainly her day! There, another friend had brushed her off with annoyance. But why? Was it because her way of life had no place in this busy world at war? Rhea was not a moron. \"Everybody else can't be wrong. Turn the light on yourself,\" a voice inside her insisted. So reluctantly she forced herself to a reckoning. She felt terribly let down, but she was not in tears. In fact, looking at herself as at a stranger, she was half inclined to smile. She had always concentrated on getting what she wanted out of life. Her husband had been a great one to pull her away from her too avid pursuit of things. A favorite jingle of his came to her mind now:\nStop doing whatever you do do, And do whatever you don't. Whatever you don't do Might agree with you, Since whatever you do do, don't.\n\"That must mean a regular job for me.\" In spite of herself Rhea was smiling. Through force of habit she looked at the clock and turned on the radio for the news. The voice that came to her was a direct appeal, \"There is a crucial shortage of adult help in the canning industry. Food will win the peace. If you have any time to spare, apply at your local U. S. Employment Office at once. Don't wait. The need is urgent.\"\nWas that Rhea's cue to plunge, to dive in before she had time to get frightened? She fingered the tele-\n617\nphone directory uncertainly. What on earth could she do at a canning factory? Peel tomatoes? No, no. She'd get fallen arches, and a lame back, and have no fingernails, and she didn't have to work unless she wanted to, and she didn't want to or did she? Morning would be time enough to decide. Anyway there was the business of calling off the party at her summer placemore telephone calls. Rhea didn't go out that night. Instead she went to bed and couldn't sleep. The gnat of indecision can cause a lot of uncomfortable buzzing in the brain. But by morning Rhea had reached a decision. She hinted to Maude later that a dream about her mother had clinched the matter.\nAT the Employment Office she was told that the canning factory needed an adult supervisor for girls to see that nothing slovenly was allowed, a woman who would be able to keep the standards high without antagonizing the girls. Would she like to try it? Rhea answered that she had come around to offer her services as a tomato peeler, but she would work any place they could use her, but that she had had no experience. Rhea was extremely modest today.\n\"Perhaps your experience with handling people will come in just right,\" the plant superintendent told her genially. \"If not, we can still use you to handle tomatoes.\"\nSSIX weeks later, Laura and Maude were lunching with Rhea. It was after work for all three of them. They sat on the terrace on the cool side of the house drinking fruit juice from tall glasses and eating thin sandwiches. The food was good but simple. The women were tired but jolly. Rhea had been regaling them with a recital of her first week at the factory. It had been awful at the time, but looking back in the light of her present success with the girls, it seemed merely amusing. Her listeners rocked with laughter. There was no boredom here, nor fidgeting to get away.\n\"I never thought you'd do it, Rhea,\" Laura wiped a tear away. \"Though I knew you could if you once made up your mind.\"\n\"You didn't let any grass grow under your feet,\" Maude said. Then suddenly, \"What did you dream about Mother that night anyway?\"\nRhea's face suddenly changed from jocularity to a serenity that was soothing to see. \"It was beautiful,\" she said softly. \"Almost too beautiful to talk about. I had been tossing all night, and then as dawn approached I fell into a sleep peaceful as a desert twilight. It was twilight, all splendid with golden clouds and bright with the muted brightness that lingers after the sun has gone. And Mother and I were walking together in a country lane. Mother was wearing one of those huge gingham aprons, and it seemed to be full as usual with stuff from the garden. I plucked at it playfully. 'What's this you're carrying?' 'Beans,' she said, turning her face full upon me. But the smile she gave me. You remember it, Maude. How she'd look at us with such an understanding kindness after we'd been naughty, and from seriousness how her face would bloom with love. That's really all there was to the dream. Just Mother and her apron full of beans and her smile, but it was enough to turn my mind back to a real happening.\n\"It was the summer before my last year at college. Some of my sorority sisters were visiting with us. After supper I discovered Mother was out in the garden picking vegetables. She looked like a peasant woman, a black figure with her apron poked out in front with its earthly burden. I went out to help her, also to protest that my girl friends would think it was queer that she should be doing this menial labor. 'But why must you do it, Mother? If anyone wants these beans let them come and get them, if not let them go.' 'I can't let things go to waste,' Mother had replied. 'If the earth is bountiful we must see that its yield is harvested. I call it keeping faith with the soil, Rhea. I could not sleep if I knew things were wasting in the garden.' So when she said 'Beans' and smiled, I knew what she meant.\"\n\"'Keeping faith with the soil'what an idea. So that's why you went to the cannery,\" Laura mused. \"I didn't know you were raised on a farm, Rhea?\"\n\"Yes. Mother died the following year and Father sold the place so that summer was my last one there.\"\n\"What will you do when the canning season is over?\"\n\"Guess?\" but she could not give them time to guess for her own eagerness, \"I'm going to be a Nurses' Aid. I've already signed up.\"\n\"But Rhea! That's real work, you know.\"\n\"Do you remember that little lec-\n\nTHE GRACIOUS YEARS\nture you used to give us about the gracious years?\" Maude asked. \"Where do they come in?\"\n\"Yes, I remember very well, for after all I did a lot of striving toward those gracious years.\"\n\"And what do you think of them now?\"\n\"I think the gracious years must\n619\nbe those years that a woman is allowed to render service beyond her own immediate circle; and I hope the Lord will allow me quite a few of them.\"\n\"You've learned a lot in six weeks, Rhea.\"\n\"Perhapsbut it was Mother's smile that put me on the right track.\"\nAn Appeal to Mothers\n(Continued from page 597) These rooms should be clean and sanitary and always equipped with clean towels, soap, and toilet paper.' Mirrors should also be provided, and the rooms should be in keeping with the rest of the building. Drapes at the windows add a touch of refinement. Mothers should see that rest rooms are properly kept up. Heating and Ventilation Mothers, the health of your families should be safeguarded by proper heating and ventilation. Lack of ventilation contributes to the spread of disease. Is the ventilation in the chapel as good as it is in your home? Fire Hazards Is your chapel a fire trap? Are fire extinguishers installed? Are they examined from year to year, so that your children's lives are safe in an emergency? The other day while visiting a chapel, fire extinguishers were found which appeared \"'all ready for use.\" However, the tanks were emptythe liquid had never been added! Mothers, insist that your children's lives be safeguarded while in church. Look for the Label of Approval Beginning October 1, we are going to label our chapels with an award. On the merits of the upkeep of each building, it will be labeled with Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors. Now, you good mothers of the Relief Society determine, to a great extent, what is accomplished throughout the Church. May we ask that you. Demand for your fami- - lies and yourselves a fit place in which to worship. Will you demand that dark corners be cleaned out? We should be thankful for the sacrifices that are being made throughout the Church to provide better buildings and better upkeep. We are decidedly improving, but we are not through yet. For years the General Authorities of the Church have been urging us to have clean, attractive buildings. We solicit the aid of mothers in this enterprise. If you will demand better conditions, half the battle will be won. Mothers of the Church: As with the Church, so with the people. We appeal to you to bring pressure to bear in a wholesome way. Your good bishop will listen to you. Tomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd CuaptTer VII Synopsis: Following Indian Mike's raid on El Toro, Janet's desert home, which in a measure was responsible for the death of her baby, Janet draws more and more within herself. Crowded with new fears, she does not realize that she and her husband, Paul Morgan, are growing further and further apart. Dr. Potsworth, friend and mentor, intervenes. Janet, overhearing his talk with Paul and Paul's bitter answers, wakes to the realization of her selfish absorption. Paul's determination to bring Indian Mike to trial, at any cost, adds to Janet's fears, driving out, for the time at least, the old ones that have obsessed her since the day she married Paul and came to live in San Juan. There is a renewal of their old love and companionship; Paul promises to give up the fight against Mike, and Janet is happy again. 'They decide that she shall leave soon for Washington and spend the winter in her old home. Paul is to join her when -the fall work is done. But the respite is brief. Janet learns that Juanee, her Indian woman, the mother of twins, is to have another child, and all her old grief returns. Juanee tells Janet to pray to the God of her people, and she, too, will have a child.  66 NO place, anywhere, is equal to Washington in the Spring!...\" Paul Morgan tamped the earth solidly around a small cottonwood tree he was planting. Every youngster had to have a swing tree. He hoped this one wasn't being planted too late in the year. He dropped to his knees and smoothed the earth lovingly, Janet's last letter repeating itself in his mind. \"I wish you could see the cherry blossoms, Paul,\" she'd written. \"Better still, I wish you could smell them and feel them against your face as Page 620 I'm doing now, and sit here beside me on this bench and look out across the Potomac. The water is scarcely ruffled, yet petals are blowing. Sand is probably pelting your face, in San Juan....\" Paul straightened up and looked out over the desert, shading his eyes from the sun. Before it was an hour hotter there'd be sand all right. \"You say things are looking well. I can just see themred, where green should be, copper, where there should be blue, and no water anywhere!\" Paul regarded the little tree doubtfully. What did it matter if trees grew or not? Things were precious only by association; only by being shared with someone you loved. What did it matter where houses stood or whether the earth were red or green or rivers placid or not? An unyielding cliff became a refuge when a home was built against it! A penthouse empty if... \"And the Potomac, Paul!\" (Janet's letter intruded again.) \"How different it is from the San Juan. No cliffs frown from dizzy heights along its limpid edges. Boats drift on its sun-jeweled surface. People dream along its banksSunday-morning people, people from offices and homes, hundreds of them, out to see the cherry blossoms fall! And in all this beauty Iam lonely. I guess my cherry blossoms must be shared with one I love or they bloom for me in vain... 4\" TOMORROW'S CUP Paul tamped the roots of the little tree carefully. \"Cherry blossoms must be shared with one you love. \" he repeated softly, and as he arose a song left his lips; the little tree stood straight and firmly packed into the sand at the corner of the patio between El Toro and its warm red cliffs. Paul pushed his hat back from his forehead and let the morning wind cool his face, then he turned and went in. He took Janet's letter from the arm of his chair where it had lain within easy reach during the five days since its arrival. He spread the pages out carefully on his knee as he sat down to rest. After a while he picked them up and began to read them again, though he knew the lines by heart.. \"What a bon filly person I am, Paul. When I'm there, I want to be here; and when I'm here, I want to be there. For three years now we've been seesawing back and forth between the east and the west, no nearer contentment than we were before. Three months each winter with you here, three months each summer with me there. And neither of us... Paul, when the baby comes, I'm sure everything will be different. I wish you had taken me back with you. I've been sitting here for hours thinking things over. How is Juanee? Did she bake potatoes in the ashes for me when she knew about the baby? I dreamed last night that old Mike came here and stole everything I had, that the baby was born and he took it too. I woke up, limp from fear. All the old hatreds rushed in with strangling force. This beauty, this hum of human endeavor is life, Paul. Yet only half of me is here to enjoy it.. 621 \"We have only a little while to wait, now. Doctor Eldred says I'm 'bonny.' He's a Scotchy old dear as near like Doctor Potsworth as I could find. I've been thinking of Doctor Groneman all day. He and Doc should be working together in a big hospitalyet what would San Juan do without Doc...? Here's the cabman; I had no idea my three hours were up. I'll post this on my way home. \"IT love you.... \"Janet.\" Paul sighed deeply. He folded the contents of the letter away in his thoughts, as carefully as one presses a flower between the pages of a loved book. \"If I should spend my winters here... Never go to Washington again... Janet would sometime forget El 'Toro. A person has to be happy. Life can't forever deny that,\" he thought, knowing he could never give Janet up, and that somehow he must find a way to win. He went to the water barrel, dipped a bucket in, and carried it brimming to the little tree he had planted. As he splashed it recklessly over the loose soil, a car rattled into the front yard. Doc Potsworth. He'd know the sound of that wheezy old tub anywhere. But today it was an unwelcome sound. He wanted no company. \"Can't you come to meet a person?\" Potsworth searched around in his pockets, knowing perfectly well that Paul knew he had the weekly mail. \"Not very anxious, seems to me! Got a telegram here someplace...!\" \"Telegram?\" Three strides brought Paul from the corner of the house to the car. 622 \"Sure. Any law against that?\" Potsworth thrust a yellow envelope into Paul's outstretched hand. Paul took one look at the sheet he had all but torn in two in his eagerness, gulped, and sank to the running board of the old car. Potsworth waited impatiently, but when Paul continued to gulp, unable to utter a sound, he clutched the telegram. 'Keep a privileged old friend waiting all day will you!\" He read the telegram, and his own jaw dropped. \"Jumpin' Jehoshaphat!\" he cried, \"Janet has twins!\" \"Twins?\" Paul  questioned. \"Two?\" \"Two!\" Potsworth exclaimed. Paul repeated the word weakly: \"Two.\" \"Yes, Paul, two! You're a family man now. One boy. One girl.\" \"Two,\" Paul said again, as incredulous as a child at Christmas, his face blank from astonishment. \"You no savvy, Paul?\" Potsworth explained patiently, shaking with inward laughter. \"One begay! One mechacha!\" Then he added soberly: \"What I wouldn't have given to have brought those babies into the world.\" \"But what of Janet?\" Paul demanded, scarcely hearing him. \"She'll be more afraid of San Juan than ever.\" \"This ll do wonders for her, Paul. She'll have an interest now as consuming as her fear of the country. She'll come through. Just give her time.\" \"Time! She's had little else. For years you've been telling me what to do about it. I suppose you think she'll just love coming back with a couple of babies to worry about!\" \"I suppose youre right. But just the same, she'll be back. No woman can resist the desire to show off a new baby. And twins... Well!\" \"Ill have to go to her and help her bring them home. That's a terrible responsibilitytwins!\"' \"I'm glad you sense it. Janet will come back if you go for her, but she'll bring back the same fears, the same prejudices. She's got to want to be here on her own.\" \"But Doc....\" \"I know. I know. You want to see those kids. Sure, but you've got to let Janet bring them to you.\" \"But it might be months!\" \"I'll give her exactly one and a half. And don't you go writing to her every day either.\" \"And when I do, talk about something besides cows?\" \"Exactly.\" Paul's eyes twinkled. \"If it works Pll give you a heifer calfa dozen heifer calves!\" Paul began to pace the floor in his excitement. \"I'll probably wake up and find myself asleep in my saddle, dreaming.\" \"That's good. Wake up and find yourself asleep!\" \"Well, you know what I mean. Honestly, Doc,\" Paul said seriously, \"T've about given up hope of winning Janet over. She's so set against this. Country that she won't give it a chance.\" \"Let the country take care of itself, man. Quit trying to make Janet like it. Just you get ready to enjoy those kids. The country complex will take care of itself.\". \"I wonder.\" \"And remember, you're just a bystander now. I'll be the important male around herenext to young Paul.\" TOMORROW'S CUP \"Shouldn't you have included Paulette?\" \"Say, that's not bad! Paul and Paulette! Not bad at all!\" \"Doc, where's your imagination? The boy's been named Jerry for years.\" \"Then the names won't match for I insist upon Paulette for the girl.\": \"And we're both reckoning without Janet. She'll probably choose Cactus and Cacti!\" Paul spoke sarcastically, Janet's dislike of the country rankling as it had never done before. \"Cactus and Cacti!' Doctor Potsworth chuckled, refusing to take Paul seriously. '\"'Let's wire that to Janet.\" ~ Paul looked at him, trying to suppress his mood. \"Why not?\" he laughed. \"She might even see the joke herself....\" panel, lying in her hospital bed, surrounded by flowers and gifts, read the telegram with delight. \"How perfectly adorable,\" she laughed. \"Cactus and Cacti!\" She lay back on her pillows, hands behind her head, her eyes dreamy. Paul was happy now. The little grave on the hill would never seem lonely again. Brothers and sisters make a family. What would Juanee think? Janet smiled, remembering the Indian woman's appraisal of twins: \"You give me one dollar or two dollars, I take two dollars!\" Janet reread her telegram from Paul with increasing delight. She'd long ago decided on Paulette for her daughter's name, and Paul would have nothing but Jerry for his son. Any children could be named that, but only born-to-the-range twins 623 could be Cactus and Cactieven in fun. \"Born to the range!\" Suddenly the hospital faded; the flame of setting sun through the windows became a glowing bed of coals in the center of a cave high up on Blue Mesa. Hotel Collins. Very, very far from nurses and doctors; far from the ordered loveliness that surrounded her here. She was not lying in a high white bed, but on a bed of fragrant cedar boughs in the cave; not laughing, but saying fiercely into the dark: \"Ill fight you, Paul, you and your country! I'll fght you till the day I die! Ill not bring a child up a million miles from nowhere!\" Then as suddenly the cave faded and she was back in the hospital, for a nurse had brought her babies to be fed. Her momentary rebellion was drowned in happiness. These were Paul's babies. They belonged back there with their father. She was suddenly inexpressibly lonely for Paul.... DAILY, Paul carried water to nourish the little cottonwood tree he had planted near the patio. \"Kids need a swing tree,\" he told every one who would listen. All the cowboys had brought giftslariats of miniature size, saddles, bridles, mounted silver spurs with extravagant burnt designs. But the thing that touched him most of all was a gift from Indian Joehis own twins' first moccasins. Other Indians came with their whole families to offer a 'shake,' solemnly proffering their hands, leaving rich presents for the paleface twins. There were so many gifts he'd have to build a new wing at El Toro 624 to accommodate them all. \"If only Janet would hurry and come,\" he thought dejectedly. But from the tone of her last letter the swing tree would be full grown before that happened. He sat on the back step of the patio and read the letter again. \"Dear Paul, \"Why don't you hurry the spring work along and come? Our babies are nearly a month old, and you haven't seen them. I'd come home if I could, but Doctor Eldred says the babies must be at least six months old before they can face the wilds. Anyway, I'd be scared to travel with them, even if you were here to help me. So you see you'll just have to come to us. I love you very much, dear. Please understand. I'd come home this minute if I could!\" There was much more; but news of Washington didn't interest Paul. One word only stood out like a star \"home.\" Janet had said \"home.\" She could have said... Well, just \"back\" if she had wanted to. But she'd said \"home!\" A wheezy pfpht pfpht and an extra cloud of dust in the wind, told Paul he had company. It was Potsworth again. Just the person he wanted to see. \"I'm going to D. C., Doc,\" he shouted, racing around the corner of the patio. \"And you can like it or go jump in the lake!\" - \"And where would I get a lake, young man?\" \"Well, the river then!\" \"Practically dry. Same as your humor.\" \"Tm not trying to be funny. Doc, I've got to see Janet and those babies. There's no reason why I shouldn't go. And besides I've run out of excuses.\" \"Suppose I dump one in your lap?\" \"You couldn't invent one big enough.\" \"No?\" \"Try it and see.\"  \"You like Doctor Groneman, don't you, Paul?\" \"Yes. Yes, of course. But what's that got to do with...\" \"He's coming here, Paul.\" \"Here? What for? And if he is, what of it? He doesn't need a nursemaid, does he?\" \"That's just what he does need. He's blind.\" \"Bli... Doc, say that again.\" \"Groneman is blind.\" \"That's... That's not possible. Why would the Lord let a thing like that happen?\" \"Don't we blame too much onto the Lord? It was T. B., Paultuberculosis of the eyes; a sudden rupture, and the light went out.\" There was stark incredulity in Paul's eyes. \"But he was a doctor! He worked with doctors constantly!\" he cried. \"And none of them knew. They didn't even suspect. Sometimes the blood vessels break one at a time, over long intervals, and the blindness is gradual. Rarely does it come as this did.\" \"How awful! What'll he do now? I can't picture him a useless, helpless invalid.\" \"He's not an invalid. And men of Groneman's caliber are never useless. He'll find other things to do to help the world.\" \"But what can he do here if he can't see.\" \"He can restand feed his soul. TOMORROW'S CUP It's inner vision he needs now. That's why he's coming here. Remember he said this was the top of the world?\" Paul nodded. Could be perfect, even to the blind.\" \"Will you still go gallivantin' off to Washington?\" \"No, of course not. Been for him and_ you, wouldn't be here today, Doc.\" \"There you go again, you blame God for natural consequences and leave Him out when He plays the big part.\" \"Most of the time I feel that He is pretty near, here on the desert.\" Paul picked up a wire and began fastening it to the little tree. \"But at times He seems pretty remote.\" \"Here, Ill give you a hand with that tree,' Doctor Potsworth said, breaking the tension in. His own shrewd, kindly way. \"Groneman knows about the twins, Paul.\" If it hadn't Janet \"Yes, El Toro \"When will he come?\" \"By the end of the week.\" \"Tll be ready. Joe and the foreman can take over. I'll stick around here.\" \"To the north a little, Paul.\" Potsworth straightened the tree's small trunk. \"\"A tree has to be braced against the wind.\" They worked in silence, making a boot for the trunk from an old piece of garden hose, fastening it by a guywire to a peg in the ground, so it could not give against the strong north winds. When Paul spoke again, his voice was low and unsteady. I'm scared, Doc. What if I do and say the wrong things?\" \"You will, sometimes. Who wouldn't? But you'll manage. Good-by.\" \"What will Janet think?\" Paul said to himself, and went inside. (To be continued)  Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Continued from page 610) by daily communion with Him.

Mirrors should also be provided, and the rooms should be in keeping with the rest of the building. Drapes at the windows add a touch of refinement. Mothers should see that rest rooms are properly kept up. Heating and Ventilation Mothers, the health of your families should be safeguarded by proper heating and ventilation. Lack of ventilation contributes to the spread of disease. Is the ventilation in the chapel as good as it is in your home? Fire Hazards Is your chapel a fire trap? Are fire extinguishers installed? Are they examined from year to year, so that your children's lives are safe in an emergency? The other day while visiting a chapel, fire extinguishers were found which appeared \"'all ready for use.\" However, the tanks were emptythe liquid had never been added! Mothers, insist that your children's lives be safeguarded while in church. Look for the Label of Approval Beginning October 1, we are going to label our chapels with an award. On the merits of the upkeep of each building, it will be labeled with Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors. Now, you good mothers of the Relief Society determine, to a great extent, what is accomplished throughout the Church. May we ask that you. Demand for your fami- - lies and yourselves a fit place in which to worship. Will you demand that dark corners be cleaned out? We should be thankful for the sacrifices that are being made throughout the Church to provide better buildings and better upkeep. We are decidedly improving, but we are not through yet. For years the General Authorities of the Church have been urging us to have clean, attractive buildings. We solicit the aid of mothers in this enterprise. If you will demand better conditions, half the battle will be won. Mothers of the Church: As with the Church, so with the people. We appeal to you to bring pressure to bear in a wholesome way. Your good bishop will listen to you. Tomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd CuaptTer VII Synopsis: Following Indian Mike's raid on El Toro, Janet's desert home, which in a measure was responsible for the death of her baby, Janet draws more and more within herself. Crowded with new fears, she does not realize that she and her husband, Paul Morgan, are growing further and further apart. Dr. Potsworth, friend and mentor, intervenes. Janet, overhearing his talk with Paul and Paul's bitter answers, wakes to the realization of her selfish absorption. Paul's determination to bring Indian Mike to trial, at any cost, adds to Janet's fears, driving out, for the time at least, the old ones that have obsessed her since the day she married Paul and came to live in San Juan. There is a renewal of their old love and companionship; Paul promises to give up the fight against Mike, and Janet is happy again. 'They decide that she shall leave soon for Washington and spend the winter in her old home. Paul is to join her when -the fall work is done. But the respite is brief. Janet learns that Juanee, her Indian woman, the mother of twins, is to have another child, and all her old grief returns. Juanee tells Janet to pray to the God of her people, and she, too, will have a child.  66 NO place, anywhere, is equal to Washington in the Spring!...\" Paul Morgan tamped the earth solidly around a small cottonwood tree he was planting. Every youngster had to have a swing tree. He hoped this one wasn't being planted too late in the year. He dropped to his knees and smoothed the earth lovingly, Janet's last letter repeating itself in his mind. \"I wish you could see the cherry blossoms, Paul,\" she'd written. \"Better still, I wish you could smell them and feel them against your face as Page 620 I'm doing now, and sit here beside me on this bench and look out across the Potomac. The water is scarcely ruffled, yet petals are blowing. Sand is probably pelting your face, in San Juan....\" Paul straightened up and looked out over the desert, shading his eyes from the sun. Before it was an hour hotter there'd be sand all right. \"You say things are looking well. I can just see themred, where green should be, copper, where there should be blue, and no water anywhere!\" Paul regarded the little tree doubtfully. What did it matter if trees grew or not? Things were precious only by association; only by being shared with someone you loved. What did it matter where houses stood or whether the earth were red or green or rivers placid or not? An unyielding cliff became a refuge when a home was built against it! A penthouse empty if... \"And the Potomac, Paul!\" (Janet's letter intruded again.) \"How different it is from the San Juan. No cliffs frown from dizzy heights along its limpid edges. Boats drift on its sun-jeweled surface. People dream along its banksSunday-morning people, people from offices and homes, hundreds of them, out to see the cherry blossoms fall! And in all this beauty Iam lonely. I guess my cherry blossoms must be shared with one I love or they bloom for me in vain... 4\" TOMORROW'S CUP Paul tamped the roots of the little tree carefully. \"Cherry blossoms must be shared with one you love. \" he repeated softly, and as he arose a song left his lips; the little tree stood straight and firmly packed into the sand at the corner of the patio between El Toro and its warm red cliffs. Paul pushed his hat back from his forehead and let the morning wind cool his face, then he turned and went in. He took Janet's letter from the arm of his chair where it had lain within easy reach during the five days since its arrival. He spread the pages out carefully on his knee as he sat down to rest. After a while he picked them up and began to read them again, though he knew the lines by heart.. \"What a bon filly person I am, Paul. When I'm there, I want to be here; and when I'm here, I want to be there. For three years now we've been seesawing back and forth between the east and the west, no nearer contentment than we were before.

Any children could be named that, but only born-to-the-range twins 623 could be Cactus and Cactieven in fun. \"Born to the range!\" Suddenly the hospital faded; the flame of setting sun through the windows became a glowing bed of coals in the center of a cave high up on Blue Mesa.

She was not lying in a high white bed, but on a bed of fragrant cedar boughs in the cave; not laughing, but saying fiercely into the dark: \"Ill fight you, Paul, you and your country! I'll fght you till the day I die! Ill not bring a child up a million miles from nowhere!\" Then as suddenly the cave faded and she was back in the hospital, for a nurse had brought her babies to be fed. Her momentary rebellion was drowned in happiness. These were Paul's babies. They belonged back there with their father. She was suddenly inexpressibly lonely for Paul.... DAILY, Paul carried water to nourish the little cottonwood tree he had planted near the patio. \"Kids need a swing tree,\" he told every one who would listen.

FROM THE FIELD Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for \"Notes from the Field\" appear in the Magazine for June 1942, page 420. RELIEF SOCIETY WAR AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES HE Relief Society annual report for 1942, published in the recent June-July issue of the Magazine, indicated for Relief Societies throughout the Church the extent of war and welfare services by the Society. Part of this report dealt with Relief Society sewing service at local Relief Society meetingssewing service for the Society and its members, for the Church Welfare Program, and for the Red Cross and other worthy community agencies. 'This report indicated that an average of nearly 29,000 women gave sewing service at each monthly work meeting to the extent of approximately 382,000 hours, during which 116,882 articles were com- | pleted. Of this total number of articles, the greatest number (38,381 or approximately one-third of the total) was made for the Red Cross, with 29,048 being made for Relief Society, 19,446 for bishops' storehouses, and 30,007 for hospitals and all other agencies. Clothing for children constituted the largest group, according to kinds of articles made. Next in importance were quilts, which, for one hundred years, have symbolized Relief Society sewing service. It was in the Society's second year, in a meeting held October Page 626 14, 1843, that Phebe M. Wheeler, the assistant secretary, proposed \"that a sewing society be appointed that garments and bed clothing may be made and given to such as are suffering cold and nakedness.\" Quilts made during 1942 numbered 13,034-and it is expected that quilts made during 1943 will greatly exceed this number, for 1943 is doubtless the greatest quilt-making year so far in Relief Society. In addition to the usual number of quilts made, the Society undertook an assignment by the Church Welfare Committee to fill an assignment in the ratio of one quilt to every one hundred Church members, these quilts to be turned into bishops' storehouses. In addition, the General Board of Relief Society recommended that all Societies in war risk areas provide themselves with ward first-aid supplies, including 12 quilts or blankets. Furthermore, the General Board also suggested that a final check be made to discover whether all families were adequately supplied with bedding, and urged that encouragement and assistance be given to help families complete their bedding supplies. Many stake and ward Relief Societies had already conducted bedding projects for the benefit of families with- NOTES FROM THE FIELD 627 OVER 100 QUILTS WERE DISPLAYED AT THIS RELIEF SOCIETY QUILTING IN THE EMERY WARD, EMERY STAKE, 1943 in their boundaries. 'The following reports from wards and stakes reflect the activities of the Society with respect to the quilt-making project for the Church Welfare Program, the bedding plans for the benefit of members, Red Cross sewing, and other war Services. Emery Stake (Utah) MYRLE B. JOHANSEN, stake secretary-treasurer, recently wrote as follows: \"A suggestion given in one of the bulletins from the General Board that Relief Societies encourage their members to repair | and make new bedding, while materials were available, resulted in a most profitable project in the Emery Ward of our stake. \"They called it the 'Help One Another Project,' and every woman in the ward was invited to participate. The project covered a period of two and one-half months, and' approximately 3,246 hours were spent in quilting. Over 158 quilts were made. At the time the accompanying picture was taken, over 100 quilts were displayed. Six quilts were made for Church Welfare at one time, and over eighty women were present. Light refreshments were served at every quilting. Wynona Petty is president of the Emery Ward. \"At the present time, this ward has a very worthy summer project for their visiting teachers. Each month a social is given in every district, at the home of a widow, a service star mother, or an aged sister. The program is made up by those living in the district and many participate who have not had the privilege of doing so before.\" Los Angeles Stake (California) EMMA LYM, secretary of the Beverly Hills Ward, reports: \"Our Relief Society anniversary celebration was a success in every respect. An old-fashioned quilting party was held on March 11. A pleasant program was presented during the quilting and a luncheon served. On March 17 a number of our members went to the Red Cross Blood Bank and gave blood donations. It was felt that no better way could be found to adequately commemorate the anniversary of the Society. \"For our closing party the entire group reported at the Red Cross center at the El Rodeo School in Beverly Hills on June 3. The morning was spent preparing surgical dressings and rolling bandages. The women found it an enjoyable as well as useful occupation. Lach _ sister brought a box lunch and at noon adjourned to Roxbury Park. Here lunches were exchanged and enjoyed. After lunch an informal program was presented for the pleasure of all present. \"We are happy to report that these activities of small service have been highly successful in increasing the spirit of cooperation and friendship among the members of Beverly Hills Ward.\" Young Stake (New Mexico) EMMA B. EVANS, president of the very small Relief Society at Shiprock, New Mexico, reported in June: \"We have made quilts and dresses and sold them in the store here. We have made molasses taffy, popcorn balls, etc., and sold them to the sweet-hungry school children. By May 26, which we had set as our $100 goal, we had purchased $100 worth of war bonds and sold quilts and two dresses besides. We have six members.\" Navajo-Zuni Mission (New Mexico) EMMA B. EVANS of Shiprock was recently appointed with her husband, President Ralph William Evans, to preside over the new Navajo-Zuni Mission. When she wrote in June, there were no organized Relief Societies among these Indian women, but many of them who were interested were assisting with the Sunday School and Primary Association meetings, and doing missionary work. She reported as follows her visit to Crystal, New Mexico, \"away up in the tops of the mountains\" where the only full-time missionary was stationed: \"This lady missionary had taught the Navajo women to make quilts. I wish you could see the two quilt tops they have made. One is put together with bright green and the other with a very bright yellow. The quilt blocks are perfect, every color blended and stitched as perfectly as their Navajo blankets are made. Instead of cutting their blocks as they would come on the material, the conventional flower design was in the center of each diamond, giving it an appliqued effect. Their faces shone when I told them that I would send the cotton for the first one, and how lovely they were. They intend to make and sell enough quilts to buy an organ or piano for their little church. \"You would thnill with pride if you were to see the little one-roomed church which they reconditioned with the help of Jim Collyer, the Mormon trader there. It has a good floor, newly painted walls, good benches, bright Navajo colors at the neatly curtained windows. Our visit was unexpected, but vases of evergreen and flowers adorned tables and  NOTES FROM THE FIELD windows, and Brother Polocca was on hand to take charge of the meeting. This new member has full charge since there are no missionaries there now. Just lately a protestant church there had six missionaries holding revival meetings, but this staunch new member held his ground and carried on in face of great opposition.\" Shelley Stake (Idaho) SADIE KIRKHAM, stake sewing leader, at the request of Annie B. Johnsen, stake Relief Society president, reported in 1942: \"In one Relief Society bedding project we have quilted 410 quilts. People who could afford to do so paid for the work, and the money was used to buy quilts and blankets for those who could not afford to pay. Then the stake Relief Society cooperated in a government mattress project. We made 207 mattresses. Through the applications for mattresses we learned the real needs of the people in our stake better than we could have found out in any other way. It has been a big undertaking, but we have enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing we have helped people to have warm bedding who have never had it before, and we surely need it in Idaho.\" Southern Arizona Stake (Arizona) GLADYS E. HUISH, president of Southern Arizona Stake Relief Society, reported in 1942 details of this stake's bedding project: \"First, we decided to ask each member to 629 have enough bedding on hand to last for five years and gave them a suggestive list to go by. To help the women with their quilts, each ward organization offered to quilt one quilt without charge for each member who would prepare and furnish her own material; some wards quilted one and tied one for each member. Of course, there were some who did not need any quilts made and a few who could not afford to buy materials. For the latter, the association bought the material and quilted the quilts. We suggested for the sheets and slips that they take advantage of the layaway plan early before prices were raisedwhich many did. We made each ward president responsible for her own members. \"When we took a survey early in October, we found that 70 per cent of our women had enough bedding for 5 years, many others for 3 years, some for only one, and a very few who hadn't done anything. Our presidents will still work with these few. \"In order to get so many quilts quilted most of the wards met regularly in work meetings each Tuesday allsummer. Some held all-day work meetings every Tuesday. For our clothing project we asked the families to try to have enough clothes besides the ones they were wearing to last children for one year, and adults for two years. 'To help them with this, we submitted a suggestive list to go by. Each ward was also asked to lay away four complete layettes for infantsand have done so.\" (Reports on Relief Society War and Welfare Activities will be continued in \"Notes From the Field\" for November.), DEPARTMENT Theology Articles of Faith Lesson 20Christ's Reign on Earth Tuesday, January 4, 1944 (This is the fourth lesson dealing with Article 10) Article 10: We believe.. Earth;.... That Christ will reign personally upon the Lesson Aim: To show that after the cleansing of the earth by fire and the destruction of all wicked people upon the earth, that Christ will reign personally during the Millenium, and that during the millennial reign things not yet accomplished will be fulfilled preparatory to the end of the world. CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 20, First and Second Advents The facts of our Lord's birth in the flesh, of His thirty and three years of life among mortals, of His ministry, sufferings, and death, are accepted as attested history. \"In the meridian of time\" Christ was born to earth, amid humble surroundings. His coming had been _ heralded through the previous centuries, even from the dawn of human existence. Every important incident connected with His birth, life, death, triumphal resurrection, and ultimate glo as King, Lord and God, had been predicted. Judah and Israel had been told to prepare for the coming of the Page 630 TALMAGE'S, ARTICLES OF FAITH Anointed One; yet when He came to His own, they received Him not. Similarly benighted are they who reject the prophetic evidence of His second coming, and who fail to read the signs of the times, which declare the event, at once glorious and tertible, to be near. Christ's Second Coming Predicted and Signs Described; Biblical Prophecies The prophets of the Old Testament, and those of Book of Mormon record who lived and wrote before the era of Christ, had little to say regarding the second coming of the LESSON DEPARTMENT Lord in comparison with their numerous and explicit predictions concerning His first advent. The Lord's second advent was foretold by these prophets, however, as the scriptures abundantly aver (Ps. 50:1, 3; Isa. 35:4, 5-10; 40:10; Jude 14, 15; Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:60, etc.). Jesus taught the disciples that His mission in the flesh was to be of short duration, and that He would come again to earth, for we find them inquiring in this wise: \"Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?\" In reply, our Lord detailed many of the signs of the latter times (Matt. Chap. 24; Luke Chap. 21), the last and greatest of which He thus stated: \"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come,\" (Matt. 24:14). With great clearness, Jesus spoke of the worldliness in which the children of men had continued to indulge, even to the eve of the deluge, and on the day of the fiery destruction which befell the Cities of the Plains, and added: \"Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed\" (Luke 17:26-30). At the time of the ascension, as the apostles stood gazing into the firmament where a cloud had hidden the resurrected Lord from sight, they became aware of the presence of two visitants in white apparel, who said: \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven\" (Acts 1:11). 631 Among Book of Mormon Prophecies 'Among Book of Mormon prophecies it is sufficient to consider here the personal assurances of Christ at the time of His ministrations to the Nephites in His resurrected state. In promising the three disciples the desire of their hearts, He said, \"Ye shall live to behold all the doings of the Father unto the children of men, even until all things shall be fulfilled according to the will of the Father, when I shall come in my glory with the powers of heaven\" (III Nephi 28:7-8). Rd The Word-of Modern Revelation The word of modern revelation is no less sure regarding the appointed advent of the Redeemer (Doctrine and Covenants 33:17; 34:6-7; 45: 37-44). The Precise Time of Christ's Coming The precise time of His coming has not been made known unto man (Doctrine and Covenants 49:7; Matt. 25:13; 24:42, 44; Mark 13: 33 35; Luke 12:40; etc.). His coming will be a surprise to those who have ignored His warnings, and who have failed to watch. Christ's Reign; The Kingdom The scriptures abound with declarations that the Lord will yet reign among His people, and that His kingdom will be everlasting (Ps. 10:16; 29:10; 145:13; 146:10; Jer. 10:10; Dan. 4:34-37; 7:27; Micah 4: 7; Luke 1:33; Rev. 11:15). Kingdom and Church Although the phrases \"kingdom of heaven,\" \"kingdom of God,\" 632 \"kingdom of Christ\" or simply \"kingdom\" may be used interchangeably, a careful study of the context in each instance may be necessary to a proper comprehension of the writer's intent (Doctrine and Covenants 65: 2, 5-6). At the time of His glorious advent, Christ will be accompanied by the hosts of righteous ones who have already passed from earth; and saints who are still alive on earth are to be quickened and caught up to meet Him, then to descend with Him as partakers of His glory (Doctrine and Covenants 88:91-98). With Him too will come Enoch and his band of the pure in heart; and a union will be effected with the kingdom of God, or that part of the kingdom of heaven previously established as the Church of Christ on earth; and the kingdom on earth will be one with that in heaven. Then will be realized a fulfillment of the Lord's own prayer, given as a pattern to all who pray: \"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\" (Matt. 6:10). The Millennium During the millennial era, both mortal and immortal beings will tenant the earth, and communion with heavenly powers will be common. Vicarious work for the dead will continue with renewed fervor. Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed again he shall only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of the earth (Doctrine and Covenants 43:30-31). Then the earth will pass to its celestial condition and become a fit abode for the glorified sons and daughters of God. The Millennium should be considered as a sabbatical eraa thousand years of peace, wherein enmity between man and beast shall cease, and love shall rule (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:65; Isa. 11:6-9; 65: 17, 20-25; Doctrine and Covenants 29:11, 22-23; 43:30-31; 63:49-51; 77: 12), SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE Suggested Songs \"Come, Thou Glorious Day of Promise,\" by Alex Neibaur, Relief Society Songs, page 52; Latter-day Saint Hymns, No. 275. \"Come, O Thou King of Kings,\" by P.

LESSON DEPARTMENT Pictures Well-selected pictures add interest to the lesson and create an appropriate atmosphere. Famous pictures of Christ might be used in connection with this lesson. (Pictures may be obtained at small cost from the Perry Picture Co.; Malden, Massachusetts. ) Suggested Questions and Study Helps (Note: In early editions of The Articles of Faith by James E. Talmage, a series of questions and suggestive exercises were included. The following were prepared by the author for this particular chapter: ) 1. Compare the conditions attending Christ's first advent, with those predicted for His second coming. 2. Cite scriptural prophecies regarding the second coming of Christ, with attendant signs: 1, Biblical; 2, Book of Mormon; 3, modern. 3. What evidence have you to prove that the predicted second coming of Christ is near at hand? 4. What is known as to the time of His coming? 5- Show by scripture that Christ is to reign as King on earth. 6. Demonstrate the relation between the kingdom of God and the Church of Christ. 7. Show the distinctive sense in which kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven are spoken of in modern revelation. 8. What will be the position of honest and honorable men who are not members of the Church when the kingdom of heaven is established? 9. What is the Millennium? 10. Give scriptural authority for your belief as to the conditions that are to characterize the Millennium. 11. What will be the condition of Satan during and after the Millennium? 633 Suggestions for the Use of the Questions The question is a \"major mainspring to mental activity.\" The question-and-answer method is one of the important teaching methods and, if properly handled, may be made to contribute effectively to the aims of teaching. Questions should be clear and concise. One important purpose of questions is to stimulate and direct thinking; that is, to start the class members on a line of thought and then to direct their thought movement to a given conclusion or goal. The use of questions should be carefully planned. They should contribute to the development of the lesson and to the realization of lesson aims. The \"Suggested Questions and Study Helps\" may be used in a variety of ways: 1. They may be used by the class leader _as a guide for her preparation of the lesson. 2. The entire list of questions and study helps may be given to the members of the class as a guide for the preparation of the lesson by all the class members. 3. Certain questions may be assigned to individual class members for special reports. These reports should be limited as to time and introduced by the class leader at the proper places in the presentation of her lesson. 4. Three or four of the questions could be given to the entire class for special thought and preparation, and the remaining questions given to individuals for special preparation. 5. A question could be assigned to a committee of three or four members the month before the lesson presentation. On the day of the lesson presentation, one of the three members could report for the committee. This method could be used to give many members in a large class definite assignments. The pre-meeting of the committee would give the members an opportunity of getting better acquainted with the lesson and with each other. 6. These questions could be used as a review of the lesson. Note: The class members should be urged to bring the standard works of the Church. They should be urged to study these lessons before they are discussed in class. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Discourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925: Christ will not cease his labors pertaining to this earth until it is redeemed and sanctified, ready to be presented spotless to the Father Page 45. The Savior has not finished his work, and cannot receive the fulness of his glory until the influence and power of the wicked are overcome and brought into subjection. When the wicked inhabitants of the earth, the beasts of the field, fowls of the air, fish of the sea, all mineral substances, and all else pertaining to this earth, are overcome, then he will take the kingdom, present it to the Father, and say, \"Here is the work you gave me to doyou made the appointmentI have wrought faithfully, and here are my brethren and sisters who have wrought with me. We have wrought faithfully, together; we have overcome the flesh, hell and the Devil. I have overcome, they have followed in my footsteps, and here are all thou hast given me; I have lost none, except the sons of perdition.Page 45. When he again visits this earth, he will come to thoroughly purge his kingdom from wickedness, and, as ruler of the nations, to dictate and administer to them as the heir to the kingdom; and the Gentiles will be as much mistaken in regard to his second advent as the Jews were in relation to the firstPage 46. Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, 1938 edition: Signs of Second Coming Have Commenced Mea profess to prophesy. I will prophesy that the signs of the coming of the Son of Man are already commenced. One pestilence will desolate after another. We shall soon have war and bloodshed. The moon will be turned into blood. I testify of these things, and that the coming of the Son of Man is nigh, even at your doors. If our souls and our bodies are not looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man; and after we are dead, if we are not looking forth, we shall be among those who are calling for the rocks to fall upon them. Page 160. Hearts of Children Turn to Fathers The hearts of the children of men will have to be turned to the fathers, and the fathers to the children, living or dead, to prepare them for the coming of the Son of Man. If Elijah did not come, the whole earth would be smitten.Page 160. Judah must return, Jerusalem must be rebuilt, and the temple, and water come out from under the temple, and the waters of the Dead Sea be healed. It will take some time to rebuild the walls of the city and the temple, etc.; and all this must be done before the Son of Man will make His appearance. 'There will be wars and rumors of wars, signs in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, the sun turned into darkness and the moon to blood, earthquakes in divers places, the seas heaving beyond their bounds; then will appear onc grand sign of the Son of Man in heaven. But what will the world do? They will say it is a planet, a comet, etc. But the Son of Man will come as the sign of the coming of the Son of Man, which will be as the light of morning cometh out of the east.Pages 286-287.  LESSON DEPARTMENT 635 Visiting Teachers Messages to the Home Sources of Strength Lesson 4The Development of Strength Through Work Tuesday, January 4, 1944 WORK, we repeat, is a panacea for the ills of life. It is a source of joy and the price of things most worthwhile, the only path to be pursued that will bring satisfaction and victory to each individual. To quote Carlyle, \"Labor is worship,\" and he declares it to be the greatest discovery beneath the sun. No man nor woman can be truly happy who does not carry some responsibility and do some useful work. Blessed is the man who has found his work, who can lose himself in it, who gets joy out of it, who comes to it in the morning with gladness in his heart. To quote Proverbs 22:29: \"Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.\" There is a well-known story of a farmer who, on his deathbed, called his three idle sons about him to impart to them an important secret. \"My sons,\" said he, \"a great treasure is hidden in the estate which I am about to leave to you.\" The old man gasped.. \"Where is it hid?\" exclaimed the sons. \"I am about to tell you,\" said the old man. \"You will have to dig for it.' But his breath failed him before he could impart the weighty secret, and he died. Forthwith, the sons set to work to spade and dig the long-neglected field, and they turned over every sod and clod upon the estate. They discovered no treasure, but they learned to work; and when the field was sown and the harvest came, lo, the yield was prodigious, in consequence of the thorough tilling which it had received. Then it was that they discovered the treasure of which their wise father had advised themit was the yield of the estate from their own labors. Happiness never resides in what an individual has, but always in what the individual does. \"The more a man works, the longer he lives. 'The less he works, the sooner he dies.\" There is only one person for whom there is no hope, and that's the idler. \"The idler shall not eat the bread of the laborer.\" Much work may be required in making a home and keeping it. 'This is often hard and monotonous work, but commonplace as it may seem, it is vitally important. Home building, in its truest meaning, is one of the greatest of the fine arts. The home is the center of happiness, a source of civilization. Work Thank God for the might of it, The ardor, the urge, the delight of it, Work that springs from the heart's desire Setting the soul and the brain on fire. Oh, what is so good as the heat of it, And what is so glad as the beat of it, And what is so kind as the stern command Challenging brain and heart and hand? Angela Morgan If the Almighty should come to me with complete success in his right hand and cternal struggle in his left, I would choose the left.Socrates. Discussion 1. What are some of the physical values of work? The psychological, particularly in times of mental or emotional strain? 2. Give specific instances from Church history in which the importance of work has been emphasized by Church leaders.

Of all the ways of getting on in the world, the shortest and best is to make people believe that it will be to their interest to help you along.La Bruyere. THE home affords the best environment for learning management, and family cooperation is an important factor in the successful management of homes in today's busy world. The parent needs to realize the importance of housekeeping experience for the child as a means of development, and as an expeditious method of solving housekeeping problems. Pressure of many kinds causes mothers to say, \"It takes less time to do it myself.\" This statement reflects a lack of recognition of the important place management plays in living in a modern world, as well as the value of family effort in housekeeping. At different periods of time, the customs and habits of people have differed. 'The problems of housekeeping and homemaking have changed with each succeeding period. Weare confronted today with a situation wherein that which we have must be given great care, because of the difficulties of replacement. This is particularly true if we would preserve, in beauty, our floors and floor coverings. 'Their attractive appearance and the service which they give depend in large measure upon how they are cared for. Volumes have been written upon the subject of floors and their finishings, coverings, and care. Hard and  LESSON DEPARTMENT soft pine, maple, ash, and oak are the woods most frequently used for floors. Soft pine has the advantage of being least expensive. Oak is considered by many persons to be the best wood for floor uses, particularly if it is quarter-sawed. Maple, however, is preferred by those who like light-colored wood floors. Wood floors that are stained, painted, oiled or waxed have grown steadily in favor and are now in general use. These floors are usually partly covered by rugs, large or small. There is much to be said in favor of these finished floors. When well kept, they are very beautiful; and they may be kept so by daily dusting with a dry mop and an occasional thorough cleaning and refinishing. Rugs used on these floors may be cleaned as often as necessary without great effort and are easily reversed, which lengthens their wear. Thus the finished-wood and rugcovered floor is more sanitary and has other advantages over the fully carpeted floor. However, much may also be said in favor of the fully carpeted floor. Some people object to any bare floor, particularly when it is waxed, because of the danger of slipping. This, however, can easily be overcome by using, where traffic occurs, non-skid matting under small rugs. Many people think that wax makes the most desirable and lasting fioor finish for living rooms. The expense of this finish is somewhat more than a varnish finish because of the great amount of labor required. To keep a waxed floor in good condition it should be thoroughly cleaned at least once a year with turpentine or solvent and steel wool, 637 and then given two coats of highgrade floor wax. A soiled spot or stain may be removed from a waxfinished floor with turpentine or solvent, the spot treated, and the place covered anew with wax. With what should one cover the kitchen floor? Of all the kitchen floor coverings in use at the present time, linoleum seems to be the most satisfactory. A linoleum floor is resilient and easy to walk tipon. Inlaid linoleum is perhaps the most satisfactory kind. Good linoleum is about a quarter of an inch thick and inlaid on canvas. Inlaid linoleum has the pattern or color extending from the surface through to the burlap base. Printed linoleum has a pattern printed on the surface only, and constant washing soon obliterates the pattern. Linoleum may be kept in condition by waxing at frequent intervals. It may be washed with mild soap and water. The surface may be protected by a linoleum lacquer in place of, wax or varnish. Lacquer or varnish preserves the pattern of printed linoleum, but soon wears off in places that are most used, unless measures are taken to protect these spots. Linoleum with the pattern worn off may be painted and given an entirely new and fresh appearance. The manufacture of both linoleum and carpets is greatly cut down at the present time due to the war. The mills are weaving carpets on a monthly basis only. All dealers are on allotments, and the allotments are small. All-wool carpets are no longer made. All-cotton carpets and tugs, as well as those which are a mixture of cotton and woolsometimes cotton, wool, and rayonare now all that is being made. The various kinds of rugs and carpets which have been on the market until very recently are too numerous to discuss in this short lesson. One of the most satisfactory floor covering for living rooms, from the point of view of many decorators is broadloom carpet in a soft, dark, solid color. It must be remembered, however, in selecting rugs or carpeting that walls and floors are a background for other furnishings. Therefore, patterns and colors that \"rise up and hit you\"that is, startling colors and, in general, large designs are to be avoided. All rugs and carpets improve in glossiness and beauty under proper care. Cheap or expensive, they should be vacuum cleaned in the direction they were woven. Rugs should never be beaten or whipped. They should never be hung over a line. Small rugs should be brushed with a whisk broom in preference to sweeping them. Suggestions for Study 1.

IT is realized that the business of housekeeping has not kept pace with the tremendous advancement in other lines of human endeavor, that the wonderful discoveries in science and the developments in the arts only slowly and partially have been applied to the problems of home life. However, enough has been applied to the home to make a study of modern housekeeping methods both interesting and profit Confucius. Able. In a short course, such as we are presenting in Relief Society, we cannot discuss all that is new and better in housekeeping methods, but it is hoped that enough information will be given to help class members with some of their housekeeping problems and to stimulate them to seek further for efficient ways of doing their household tasks. In wall coverings one has the choice of many materialspaint,  LESSON DEPARTMENT kalsomine, wallpapers of many kinds, grass cloth, etc. In deciding what covering to use, consideration must be given to beauty, service, and cost. In selecting a wall covering one must consider what is to be required of it. Is color that harmonizes with room furnishings of first importance, or is texture more important than color? Will the wall covering have to withstand a great deal of cleaning, or may it go for several years with only light dusting? Is the cost too great in proportion to the service the covering will render, or will its durability justify the cost? It is important also to decide how much labor will be involved in covering the walls, and whether or not the person to do the work understands the proper handling of his materials. A good paint job is in many respects preferable to any other type. Of wall finish. Although it is more costly than most other types, it is also more durable. Wall paints are both glossy and dull and, of course, have a wide range of color possibilities. The colors of good paints fade very little, so that a color well chosen may give pleasure for several years. Paint is used over plastered walls. Enamel paint is particularly costly as a material, requiring both time and skill to apply well. It usually produces a glossy surface not often desirable over an entire wall, except in kitchens and bathrooms where it is considered by many persons to be quite ideal. Instructions for the use of paints may be secured when they are purchased, however, surfaces should _always be clean, dry, and smooth. If the surface is covered with old paint, it should be sandpapered in order 639 to make it smooth. One should never paint over a surface that has been waxed without scrubbing off all the wax and without making sure the surface is dry. If any mending is needed it should be done before painting is started. Only new or well-cleaned brushes should be used, and they should be of a suitable width for the work to be done. Painted surfaces can be well cleaned by washing with mild soap and water or water softener and water. It has been found quite successful to apply a thin coat of cooked starch over a new paint job. This starch solution when dry leaves an invisible film over the surface which helps to make the washing job much easier. After painted walls have been once washed, the starch solution should again be applied to reduce hard work for the next cleaning period. Kalsomine as a wall finish is inexpensive. It is mixed with water, is comparatively quick to apply, and dries within two or three hours. It comes in a variety of colors and, though not as durable as paint is satisfactory on plastered walls where changes must be made frequently and where the cost of material is a consideration. Surprisingly good effects can be secured when kalsomine is well applied. Skilled workmen can so handle it as to produce almost any shade desired, and the surface obtained is dull with much the same texture as wallpaper. Frequently walls must be sized with a special sizing solution to obtain even results. Unfortunately, the colors of kalsomine fade in sunlight. Compared with paint, kem-tone, wallpaper, or canvassed walls, it is at the bottom of the list in cost. Kem-tone and similar products are new wall finishes which have recently come on the market. They are less expensive than paint, but more expensive than kalsomine. They come in paste form and have to be mixed with water. They have been very popular this past season and give beautiful results when properly applied. Instructions for their use are given on the container. Paper, as a wall covering, is so commonly used that infinite variety in color, texture, and durability has been developed. The price range is from a few cents per roll to several dollars. Wallpaper suitable in color and design for any room in a house may now be had. Small design in an allover pattern of much the same hue, but of slightly different values from that of the paper background gives a richness of texture without emphasizing design. Such papers can be successfully used in rooms where pictures are to be hung. Papers of large separate designs should be reserved for large wall areas not otherwise decorated. Wallpaper comes in washable and non-washable grades. Most wallpapers are best cleaned with the dough-type wallpaper cleaners now on the market everywhere. When propertly applied to the wall, canvas has the advantage of having rich texture and durability, but the initial cost is high as compared with most wallpapers. With restarching it can be freshened from time to time. Ceilings are usually light so as to give an impression of spaciousness. They should not be white except in white rooms, but should be keyed to the wall color in order to harmonize with it. 'The material used to cover the ceiling is usually the same as that used on the walls. If the room is too high, its height may be reduced in appearance by using a \"dropped ceiling\" or a darker shade of covering. If the ceiling is low, a striped paper, with stripes extending from base-board to ceiling, will make the ceiling appear higher than it is in reality. The woodwork is part of the background of any room, and should not be conspicuous in line or color. It may be stained, varnished or painted. Many commercial products are now on the market for cleaning woodwork, but mild soap and water will usually remove soil and spots with little or no injury to the finish. Questions for Discussion 1. What are some of the important factors to be considered in selecting the proper type of wall finish for a room? The proper kind of woodwork finish?. How does the locality in which you live affect your selection of wall coverings? How does it affect the cleaning problem? 3. Give some practical suggestions on how to properly clean painted walls with a minimum of effort; also painted woodwork. 4. Discuss some of the problems involved in covering one type of wall covering with another type; for example, kalsomine over wallpaper; wallpaper over paint; paint over kalsomine, Reference America's Housekeeping Book, Chapter 13, pp. 157-168  LESSON DEPARTMENT 641 Literature The Bible as Literature Lesson 4The Bible Ballad Tuesday, January 18, 1944 HEROIC days produce stories that are often transmitted through ballads down the ages. Lads may be briefly suggested by calling them story-songs. Tales of Robin Hood and His Merry Men are. Examples of this type of literature. In verse form, easily learned by heart, the popular stories of these Englishmen, who had taken to the greenwoods in protest against Norman tyranny, were \"half said, half sung\" as Scott puts it, and passed from generation to generation. In a lyric, a story is just suggested. In a ballad, the story is sketched. In a narrative, the story is told with detail. The ballad, in other words, is a story in essentials, given musicallyoften with \"echo lines\" to bind it more closely together. Generally, the ballad deals with but one dramatic incident. Rhythmic effects are usually distinctive, often striking. Ballads of the Robin Hood type are, of course,-not to be found in the Bible. Indeed, there are but few selections in Bible literature that may be classified as truly of the ballad type. One reason for this may perhaps be that Bible stories are usually almost as compressed as a ballad. Another, of course, is that Bible literature has its own distinguishing These balcharacteristics. In form, it does not parallel closely other literary forms. One of the examples that approaches the ballad type is found in Judges Five, Deborah's Song. A comparative study of this chapter with that of Chapter Four, helps one to get a clearer idea of the straight narrative story, and that of the ballad or song-story type. Back of these two chapters is of course the larger story leading up to the conquest of the Promised Land, and the distribution of the Tribes of Israel over their reclaimed realm. Joshua, you will remember, after crossing the Jordan, and after the triumph over Jericho, whose walls fall before his army, sweeps through the land of Canaan, defeating most of the tribes that have taken possession of it. Yet, despite the swiftness of his conquest, he fails to give heed to the Lord and sweep away the enemies of Israel \"root and branch.\" This failure brings on a series of troubles. Round about the conquered realm are various peoples Midianites, Hittites, Philistines, and othersready to fight to get back the lands from which they have been driven. After the distributing ofthe Twelve Tribes over the various parts of Canaan allotted to them, there is 642 no central government from which they can be directed, especially in a military sense. A high priest is what may be called the chief ruler and he is concerned, it would seem, with administering spiritual matters. Enemies, taking advantage of this, begin to prey upon the tribes most vulnerable to attack. At the outset, the trouble comes mainly in the great plain of Esdraelon, an open country near the center of the land of Canaan. Gradually these attacks by the enemy are increased, until something has to be done to meet them. In Judges Four we are told the story in characteristic Biblical style, with straight, clear strokes and concreteness. It begins: And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead. And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. Thus the story continues to move forward step by step, telling of the defeat of Sisera and of his flight and death at the hand of the wife of Heber the Kenite. It is a straight prose narrative rising to a climax with the final victory over Jabin the king and his destruction by the Israelites. Naturally, at the conclusion of this triumph over an enemy who had enslaved them for a score of years, there would be an outburst of rejoicing. It comes in much the same spirit as that which followed the escape of the Israelites at the Red Sea, though in a somewhat different form. In Deborah's Song (Judges Five) we have the story sketched with bursts of music portraying various emotions as the triumph is depicted. Dr. Moulton in his Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 223-225, presents the Biblical ballad in part as follows: (See also The Bible Designed to be Read As Living Literature, by Ernest Bates, pp. 180-181.) Deborah's Song For that the leaders took the lead in Israel For that the people offered themselves willingly Bless ye the Lord! In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, The highways were unoccupied, And the travelers walked through byways; The rulers ceased in Israel, They ceased LESSON DEPARTMENT Until that I, Deborah, arose, That I arose a mother in Israel. They chose new gods; There was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen Among forty thousand in Israel? Then the people of the Lord went down to the gates Awake, awake Deborah, Awake, awake, utter a song:  Arise, Barak, And lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan, In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money! They fought from heaven, The stars in their courses fought against Sisera. The river Kishon swept them away, That ancient river, the river Kishon! Oh my soul, march on with strength! Then did the horsehoofs stamp By reason of the pransings The pransing of their strong ones. Following the above lines comes the rest of the story, telling of the death of the king, of the mother looking vainly for his return in triumph. Then with swift stroke the ballad ends with So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. It is. Timely here to retell a story that came out of the reconquest of 643 the land 'of Palestine during World War I. During a battle with the Turks, a detachment of English lancers, it is said, made an attempt to charge the enemy across the '\"'ancient river Kishon\"named in the foregoing poem. Several of these horsemen went down in the quicksand of the river. When the leader was brought before the commander to report the disaster to his troops, he was asked, \"Don't you ever read your Bible? It was this same old river that helped bring defeat to Sisera.\" Discussion and Activities 1. Explain the basic meaning of the term ballad. What rather old-fashioned song do you know that is ballad-like? Why? 2. So far as the story part goes, what is the essential difference between a lyric and a ballad? A ballad and a story?

Our nation is that one among all the nations of the earth which holds in its hands the fate of the coming years. We enjoy exceptional advantages, and we are menaced by exceptional dangers; and all signs indicate that we shall either fail greatly or succeed greatly.... We shall never be successful over the dangers that confront us; we shall never achieve true greatness, nor reach the lofty ideals which the founders and preservers of our mighty Federal Republic have set before us, unless we are Americans in heart and soul, in spirit and purpose.Theodore Roosevelt. E have tried to show in the preceding lessons of this course that the United States has republican or representative form of government, and that the sacred rights and privileges of it are common to all its people. Its grant of religious and civic liberty to all its citizens is one of the noblest gifts to mankind in history, and the truest thing that can be said of our Government is that only human beings of a high degree of mental and moral fitness can appreciate its gifts, for the more perfect people become, the less control by laws do they need. Our Government was grounded in religion, and though religion did not become a part of its political system, it was virtually incorporated into the feelings and lives of the people. This can easily be accounted for. The Christian sects of Europe found asylum in America before the Revolutionary War, and the Constitution of the United States provided for freedom to worship God as people wished. The American people have naturally been religious, and allied to their religious character is reverence for the Founding Fathers who dedicated their fortunes and pledged their sacred honor for the creation of the United States. When the first Continental Congress met in Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia, September 5, 1774, delegates from all the Colonies, except, Georgia, had come to talk over their rights as Englishmen and to  LESSON DEPARTMENT make protests to the King of England because of grievances against the Government. This Congress led to the Second Continental Congress which issued to the world the Declaration of Independence. At the first session of the Congress, it was moved and seconded that the assembly be opened with prayer. While some objections were raised to the motion, it was finally carried and the Reverend Jacob Duche, Rector of Christ's Church in Philadelphia, was called in, and he opened the session with a fervent prayer. From that time to the present, every session of Congress has been opened by divine invocation, and the custom has become common in all the states when their legislative bodies meet. There is significance in the fact that the First Continental Congress was opened by prayer. It means that from the first our Government was dedicated to God, and the land consecrated to His holy purposes. 'They were select groups of Englishmen who settled these shores. Deep were their ideals of religion; holy was their concept of home life. They had as a rule been persecuted, but the people who go into a new country and have a long and perilous journey to make, develop unusual courage and determination, strong initiative, and strong convictions. As soon as the struggle for existence was over, the people began to assert themselves in new institutions. Town and county governments were developed, and these units of government were democratic, for the people met in meetings and made their own laws and appointed their own officers to enforce the laws made. Universal education was encouraged, and people 645 were free to work out their own destiny. Many new institutions were evolved, and women were freer than their sisters in the Old World. They occupied a more important place in society. Class distinction was abolished, and birth and money counted for nothing in redeeming the new country. A dominant individualism grew up, and ideals of equality, freedom of opportunity, and faith in the common man became deeply rooted in this New World. With the development of the country and the quest for the unknown, the people came to have a clearly defined conception of what \"democracy\" meant. All had a right to take part in government, both local and national. All had the right to vote for representatives to state and national legislative assemblies and for the men who should execute the laws. Citizenship in our country is a sacred opportunity and a power whereby homes, schools, churches, and civic life may be maintained for the best good of all. Citizenship requires the subordination of private interests to the public good. This naturally carries with it training in the great truth that man does not live for himself alone, but for the good of others. Good citizenship cannot exist without a deep love of home and country, for the state or city is not a mere corporation but a group of people who govern themselves, that they may have happiness and contentment. The state has a soul, and its essential greatness is its humanity. Good citizenship must conform to the political aims which we profess and to the political ideals which we cherish. In America we have what has always been called the \"democratic feeling,\" this respect of man for man, a sense of justice that is not satisfied until justice shall be the cornerstone of our Government. Our traditions hold sacredly to the ideal that men must try to think right and do right according to the highest principles of Christian ethics. God had a directive purpose in the formation of this nation, and the spirit in which the Government was established is related to the Spirit of God. The terrible war going on today is a struggle for righteousness against wrong, a struggle to maintain the true democracy of mankind over tyranny and slavery. Behind all democratic government there is a firm conviction of the divinity of man, which expresses itself in just and equitable laws. There is a call of God to nations as well as to men to maintain the gift of freedom that is conducive to the growth of the spiritual life of people. Our units of government like the state, county, and city are units of culture which make for civilization, and \"civilization\" was clearly and nobly defined by the Lord Chief Justice Russel of England when he said: \"Civilization is not dominion, wealth, material luxury; nay not even a great literature. Its true signs are thought for the poor and suffering, chivalrous regard and respect for women, the frank recognition of human brotherhood, irrespective of color or nation or religion; the narrowing of mere force as a governing factor in the world, the love of ordered freedom and abhorrence of what is mean and cruel and vile.\" The Latter-day Saints believe that to save the ideals of our democracy the people must have a stronger and more intelligent devotion to them. The Constitution of the United States gives us the democratic emphasis upon the value of life, and the right of the individual to attain unto the fullest development of his life. This has its origin in the religious and moral concepts of the Gospel which can supply democracy with an indispensable, fulfilling faith. Our Government with its Constitution is a tie that will bind the American people into a common brotherhood, and it will lead the way to other higher and spiritual unions. It blesses our efforts and it ennobles our lives. A few years ago, President Eliot of Harvard University made a statement well worth remembering. America, he said, has made five important contributions to civilization: first, we have done more than any other people to further peace keeping, and to substitute legal arbitration for the brute conflict of war; second, we have set a splendid example of the broadest religious toleration -even though Holland had first shown us how; third, we have made evident the wisdom of universal manhood suffrage; fourth, by our welcoming newcomers from all parts of the earth, we have proved that men belonging to a great variety of races are fit for political freedom; finally, we have succeeded in diffusing material well-being among the whole population to an extent without parallel in any other country of the world. These contributions to civilization are all of them the result of the practical side of the American character. The American people have retained the idealism and stability of character of their forefathers, and  LESSON DEPARTMENT they have a divine faith in their country, their Government, and in the people. The faith remains today, and for this reason there is a fineness to American character which will not allow America to become so seriously infected as to be destroyed by the false \"isms\" of Europe and other. Parts of the world. Americans are growing in religious feeling, for they are discovering that religion is the foundation of freedom and justice. It may be said today as it was said by a statesman over a hundred years ago: I see the dawn of a new and illustrious vision. I see the nation rising from its present depression with a chastened, but good spirit. I see education awakened, a spirit of sobriety ruling in work and in manners, a higher self-respect invigorating | our institutions, and the bonds of our government strengthened by a holier attachment. The building of this nation has been a long, solemn, and sacred task. It is the work of many generations of men and women who have conceived lofty ideals, and who, without regard to party, religious faith or section, \"whether up in the pine 647 forests of Maine or over across the continent in the orange fields of California, or down on the plantations of the sunny South, have wrought for freedom, for liberty, for stability, for justice.\" The American people have in a singular sense regarded themselves as the instruments of Providence in the working out of a great Government and a mighty civilization. The sacredness of our citizenship will never be given up so long as we love freedom and culture, nobility and honesty, and so long as we have respect for one another and a deep and abiding faith in the Gospel of -the Lord Jesus Christ. Questions and Topics for Discussion 1. Discuss the principles of rghteousness that lie at the root of our Government. 2. Why do we hold the Constitution of our country as sacred?. 3. What is meant by the expression: \"A government of the people?\" 4. If you designate a man or woman as a good citizen, just what do you mean? 5.

Lesson 3Nephi, a Leader in the Land of Promise Tuesday, January 25, 1944 Note: For the full effect of this lesson it is imperative that the teacher and class have at hand the Book of Mormon. Lesson Objective: To show the rewards of righteousness. EPHI, the son of Lehi, was truly a great leader and a man of faith. Of him it can be said, he sought first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all things were added unto him (Matt. 6:33). He - had learned in the tender years of his youth to honor his parents, and therefore he found it not hard to believe the accounts his father told of visions received from God. This parental example of seeking out the Lord led Nephi also to desire a direct answer to his prayers, with the result that God revealed himself unto Nephi and explained to him the need for a Savior and the necessity of a plan of salvation. Other things too were made. Known to Nephi. He was told he should become a ruler and a teacher of his brethren, and that he would be given charge of the sacred records of his people. These records were to be of great importance in the latter days in convincing both Jew and Gentile of the mission of the Messiah. Concerning the establishment, by Nephi, of a new nation in a new world, we read: \"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land. And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land. And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the earth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And... They did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were blessed in abundance. And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And as we did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper\" (I Nephi 18:22-25). At another period sometime later, when there had been a division of the original group who landed upon the shores of the New World, Nephi wrote of those over whom he had been called to preside: \"And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance. And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands. And it came to pass that they would that I should be their king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king; nevertheless, I did for them accord-  LESSON DEPARTMENT ing to that which was in my power\" (II Nephi 5:15-18). But though great were his accomplishments as a leader among his people, probably the most significant thing to be remembered about this good man is his delight in the word of God, a delight which carried him actively into the accomplishment of great and significant things for mankind. He knew the value of searching the books of the prophets for the words of eternal life, having been close to these writings through the making of plates upon which the record of his people was engraved. '... For my soul delighteth,\" he says, \"in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and profit of my children. Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard\" (II Nephi 4:15-16). According to Nephi's own account, he had made two sets of plates paralleling the same period of history for his people. 'The first set, more secular in nature, dealt largely with the wars and contentions and destructions of his people. 'The second set, written by express commandment of the Lord, includes the writings of Nephi found in the Book of Mormon as we know it today. Nephi has this to say for the smaller or second set of plates: \"And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my fa- 649 ther; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them. And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates. And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord\" (I Nephi 19:1-3). There is power in the direct and simple words of Nephi which comes from his knowledge of the truth. This prophet saw in vision the birth, death, and resurrection of the Christ hundreds of years before these events were to occur upon the earth, and his understanding of the marvelous gift of God in sending His Son is described in the language of the heart. If one wonders at the magnitude of Christ's atonement as it is written in the Bible, then let him tread Nephi's account of the mission of the Messiah. Herein is a most satisfying experience. Nephi's words concerning the coming of the Savior have, for one seeking the truth, that quiet persuasive power that is not unlike that given through the voice of a friend. Questions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the passage given to discover plain and precious truths of the Gospel brought to light in the Book of Mormon. If time permits, have each member of the class add a passage of his own from within that part of the Book of \\ Mormon (II Nephi, chapters 5 to 33) that gives Nephi's words concerning Christ to his peoplea passage that has brought new meaning to a Gospel truth. 1. Why is it hard to understand many of the great prophecies concerning the mission of Christ found in the Bible? Read II Nephi, chapter 25. The next question may be used if needed for class activity, or it may be assigned for home study: 2. In what condition will be the churches of the world in the latter days? How will new scripture be received? Read II Nephi, chapters 28, 29. L. D. S. Girls and Women in Wartime (Continued from page 606) The modern slogan that women are entitled to equal nghts and opportunities with men has led some women into fallacies of thought and practice that are very damaging 'to them and to the future welfare of mankind. In the first place, as to moral standards, equality of nghts and practices should mean that men should live up to the standards they expect of high-class women. To assume that women may indulge in the same practices that some men indulge in means that woman is simply degrading herself. From another point of view equality of rights does not mean absence of differences and duties any more than does the phrase, \"all men are created free and equal.\" The facts are, of course, that in many respects they are unequal. So in many ways men and women are different and unequal. Each sex may be superior in some respects and inferior in other respects. The difference in biological structure and functions is self-evident. The differences psychologically and socially are not so visibly manifest but are nevertheless a fact. Men and women are complements of each other. The more fully and frankly this is recognized and the life of the family and of society organized and operated on this principle, the greater will be the success and the lasting happiness of both men and women. While it may not be the destiny of every woman to become a wife and mother, to live worthy of motherhood in the highest and most sacred meaning of the term is her proper destiny and road to enduring happiness. Women who have no children of their own can generally find opportunities to take a motherly interest in children of relatives, friends, and neighbors, and in this service find at least some of the satisfactions that go with successful motherhood. Any part in the creation or development of successful lives is one of the greatest contributions to religion.  in the Church Section of The Deseret News Teacher training lessons News from all stakes of the church Full page illustrated children's section Official church welfare news m, Since 1865  Many New Features!

The architect of the wall was Truman O. Angell. The structure gives an appearance of strength, solidity, and utility, all of which is characteristic of early pioneer building. Not only does the wall enclose various edifices dear to the hearts of Latter-day Saints, including the Salt Lake Temple, the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, but it encloses the block from which the streets in Salt Lake City radiate and the principal ones receive their names.

            "content": "She Is Ours Edith S. Elliott Member of Relief Society General Board DOROTHY C. THORPE beautiful glassware exhibited in the most exclusive stores and shops throughout the nation bearing the trade name of Dorothy C. Thorpe. The better magazines advertise her wares. Newspapers and periodicals quite frequently carty news items of her fascinating art. People of wealth and influence clamor for her work, often requesting her to create special articles for them. One might ask, \"In what particular field of art does she specialize?\" The answer is overwhelming! Besides the glassware mentioned above, she designs and manufactures exquisite articles in linens, cottons, Page 598 MANY of us have admired the metals, laces, and plastics, as well as creating dainty figurines. She designs, decorates, and furnishes to the last detail an individual room or all rooms in private residences. Her boudoirs are of delicate, exquisite beauty. The nurseries that she has done delight children and are a never-ending source of pleasure to adults. When we view the products of her hands we naturally wonder about the artist herself. She was born in a Latter-day Saint home in Salt Lake City. Her parents, George Eustace and Louise Ridges Carpenter, encouraged Dorothy and provided the opportunity for development of her talents in her youth. Some may not know that this parenthood gave to Dorothy a rich heritage. Her father, born in London, was the youngest son of a wealthy Church of England clergyman, Joseph Hatton Carpenter. He enjoyed all of the advantages of a cultured, well-ordered English home. He and his brothers and sisters were given unusually good educations to fit them for the various professions to which they seemed best adapted. Just as the boys were reaching manhood, their father died, leaving an estate to be divided. The oldest brother, Joseph, took his share of the estate and decided that before settling down he would take a trip around the world. He visited the continents of Europe and Africa, sailed up the east coast of Africa, traveling on to the cities of Asia SHE IS OURS 599 GLASS TRAY WITH PLASTIC HANDLES, AND GLASS VASE, DESIGNED BY MRS. THORPE and Australia. From these cities he continued on to South America, and thence to New York City. While there, he met some Latter-day Saints and missionaries en route to Utah from his native homeland. Delighted to see some of his own countrymen and interested in their story of the Prophet Joseph Smith, he decided to accompany the Saints to the Salt Lake Valley and learn more about them and their teachings. Having been raised in a religious home, Joseph was receptive to the Gospel message and was baptized a worthy member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Anxious to share his new-found joy, he wrote to his widowed mother to tell her of his good fortune. She was shocked and grieved over the news. Her first thought was that Joseph had lost his mind, and she immediately set about to do something to rectify his condition. Joseph's brother, George, in the meantime, had decided to take his share of the family fortune and see the world also. When he reached South Africa, he became interested in the beauty and grace of the feathers of the ostrich. At that particular time ostrich plumes were \"highfashioned.\" The selling of them was extremely lucrative, so George purchased an ostrich farm and settled down to his new and fascinating venture. Business was good, and he prospered financially. Eventually, however, he received a letter from his heartbroken mother telling of his brother Joseph's sad fate. She plead with George to bring him home to London where he could be properly hospitalized. George sold his farm and set sail for the United States. Upon his arrival in Salt Lake City, he found Joseph happy and in the best of 600: health. (At the present time he is serving as recorder of the Manti Temple.) The younger Carpenter rejoiced to find his brother perfectly normal and inquired as to the reason of his mother's anxiety. Joseph and his friends explained the Gospel to George, who readily accepted the message and applied for baptism. Imagine Mrs. Carpenter's concern when she learned that her youngest son, so dear to her heart, had likewise joined this unpopular group! George made friends quickly, and was a general favorite among the young people. While living at the home of Parley P. Pratt, he became acquainted with Brother Pratt's granddaughter, Louise Ridges. She was a beautiful and accomplished gitl, Young Carpenter, in due time, fell in love with Louise and made her his bride. Louise Ridges Carpenter also has an interesting background. Besides being the granddaughter of Parley P. Pratt, whose gifts and talents are familiar to Latter-day Saints, she was also the daughter of Joseph P. Ridges, formerly of England and Australia, who built the original Tabernacle organ. She could tell man interesting tales of the building of that great organ and laughingly claimed a hand in its completion. Her mother, Agatha Pratt Ridges, made the glue that was used to fit the organ pipes together. She followed a recipe furnished by her husband, the main ingredients of which were horse and cow hoofs. The glue had to simmer and stew for quite a long period on the back of the Ridges' stove, and the smell was extremely offensive; but because they couldn't make the glue without the odor, the Ridges family accepted the ordeal and kept the pot constantly hot. The glue had to be carried to the Tabernacle hot or it wouldn't stick properly. It was the duty of little Louise to make many trips to the Tabernacle to deliver the hot glue to her father. Every time she took him his lunch pail, a bucket of glue accompanied it. George and Louise were a happy young couple. 'The young Mrs. Carpenter made a charming home for them. She was artistic, intelligent, resourceful, and energeticall qualities that make for ideal home management. Soon after the birth of their first child, a daughter Florence, George Carpenter was called on a mission to England. After making plans for the care of his lovely wife and daughter during his absence, he left for his homeland. With gratitude in his heart that his call was to England, he eagerly looked forward to receiving a warm welcome at his mother's home. He was overjoyed at the thought of teaching the Gospel in person to his family and friends. Naturally, his first call was at his mother's home. The door was closed against him. His mother later consented to meet him in a secluded section of a public park. She arrived in her elegant carriage with the shades drawn so that no one would recognize her. She admitted George to the carriage and ordered it driven along unfrequented lanes. She told him that he had humiliated and disgraced his family by joining the Mormon Church, and plead with him to renounce his membership. She begged him to desert his wife and baby, give up proselyting, and to SHE lS OURS stay in England among his kin. But George was true to his convictions. Despite the tug of family ties and temptations, he finished his mission, was honorably released, and returned to Zion. George was a gifted writer. He was city editor of the Deseret News for a number of years, and wrote for several magazines and periodicals under the nom de plume of \"Jack Plane.\" As the motion picture industry developed, Mr. Carpenter became interested in the film exchange business which later led him into the management of the Paramount Theater in Salt Lake City, which position he held until shortly before his death. One may wonder what the above recital has to do with the story of Dorothy C. Thorpe. It merely acquaints one with the kind of ancestry from which she comes. The cultured, refined, educated, talented blood of the Carpenters and the Ridges, plus the hardy, intelligent, gifted qualities of the pioneer Pratt family, have produced a genius like Dorothy. She has been aware of her talents and has never \"hidden them under a bushel.\" DOROTHY is the second child in a family of five children. When very young her parents noted that she was artistic and creative. She loved music, rhythm, color, and graceful lines. She liked to sew for her dolls, and she displayed unusual skill for a child. When only twelve years old, she designed and made a complete wardrobe for her doll which took eight first prizes in the Utah State Fair. Every year from then on she entered lovely bits of 601 DECORATIVE PIECE BY MRS. THORPE her handiwork in the Fair. Without exception each entry won a blue ribbon. Along with her creative ability and flare for design, she studied piano under the master teacher John J. McClellan. She loved melody, thythm, harmony, piano technique. She was an outstanding pupil and became an excellent concert pianist. Part of her musical education was under Professor Syler of Los Angeles. Along with the artistic hobbies that she followed, she found plenty of time to attend to her Church duties. She gave generously of her musical talent in accompaniment and piano solos. At the old L. D. S. High School, Dorothy Carpenter was an outstanding student scholastically as well as in her art classes. When Dorothy became too old to sew for dolls she transferred her interest in sewing for them to sewing 602 COMPLETE TABLE ENSEMBLE DESIGNED BY DOROTHY THORPE for her little sister Afton, who is now the wife of Bishop Frank Armstrong of Cottonwood Ward. Afton was like a beautiful dream child. She had naturally curly golden-blonde hair, big blue eyes, and fair smooth skin. Since nature had been so kind to her, Dorothy made it her pleasure to see that her clothing matched her beauty. Without being extravagant, she made exquisite lingerie for Afton. She scalloped the necks and ruffles of her little slips, and added touches of lace or ribbon in just the right places. The dresses, whether for play or best, were meticulously made and clever in design. She enjoyed visits to her sister Florence's home in Los Angeles, where she met and later married George A. Thorpe, a widower with a small son, Kelly. She won the love and affection of the little boy as well as his father. When her own son, Dick, was born, she expressed gratitude that he had such a fine big brother. Life moved on smoothly for the Thorpes. Mr. Thorpe had a splendid stock and bond business, with an income sufficient to make living interesting and progressive. It probably would have remained so had not the depression years undermined George's business. The family budget had to be trimmed many times until George's anxiety fostered a desire. In Dorothy to see if she could help. Naturally, she turned to her art and craft hobbies. She wrapped drinking glasses with bright colored raffia, shellacked the wrappings and achieved attractive beverage glasses. 'These she timidly took to a buyer in one of the Los Angeles department stores to see if she could interest him in selling such articles in his store. The buyer recognized a good saleable article and gave her an order. The glasses were popular, and the demand increased so rapidly that she had to get help from other members of her family living near by. This one idea led to others. She numbered glasses, monogrammed them, banded them with sterling silver. Each new creation met with immediate success until the business spread from the house into the garage, and finally to a factory. She added variety to her stock. Individual special orders began pouring in asking for complete dinner or luncheon sets. Ofttimes the table linen on hand didn't seem appropriate for the setting of the dishes, so she called into use her knowledge of needlework and made dinner and luncheon cloths and napkins to harmonize with the dishes. Orders became so numerous that SHE IS OURS she soon had to enlarge her factory personnel beyond the members of her immediate family. Since then she has gathered into her business Old and New World artisans whose loyalty to her can only be explained by really knowing Mrs. Thorpe. She is modest and unassuming and is willing to share her success with every member of her company. She is appreciative of their efforts and ability. Many of these persons she has trained herself, and she gets a personal pleasure from their achievements. ON E of the outstanding characteristics of Mrs. Thorpe is her spirituality. She has expressed on many occasions that she has had help and inspiration from her Heavenly Father, and feels His nearness in helping to solve problems that naturally appear in any modern business. She writes, \"There have been so many proofs of God's care and nearness in our work. How else were all these wonderful peopleour co-workers put in contact with us? There is our talented Mexican boy sand carver; Charlotte, the charming little French girl, whom I had never seen until she approached me one day in a large Los Angeles department store. Her magic fingers execute miracles of beauty in needlework. She and her family make all of our table linens, lamp shades, draperies, bedspreads, and occasional items. 'Then there is Mr. Ardron, a genius with plastics who knew absolutely nothing about the material until he worked out the first few pieces for us. He has now made such a study of plastics that I feel he leads the profession in his type of work. Also, there is the German ceramic artist who paints designs on glass and china with such 603 LAMP BASE AND SHADE DESIGNED BY DOROTHY THORPE perfection. 'There are lovely girls in the retail shop, from Bernice, the little colored stock girl, to Ann, the gracious manager, who every day is making new-friends for all of us due to her fineness and sincerity. The factory and office workers give 100 per cent efficiency and loyalty. So much credit goes to my beloved stepson, Kelly, who is now in Africa serving his country. For the past few years he has been traveling from one end of the country to the other as the factory representative, as did also my young brother Guy. Why, about a year ago before there were many shortages and lack of workers, did Miss Milba Lloyd, the capable English sculptress, come into my office and make such a fair proposition that it was possible to employ her? I am sure it was again the guiding hand of our Father in Heaven.\" Mrs. Thorpe constantly expresses appreciation for her husband who has caught the spirit of her work and encourages her and delights in her success. He carries all the business and financial responsibilities, leaving Dorothy free to revel in her creative efforts. His kindness, consideration, and understanding enable them to work closely together. Dorothy is lovely in appearance. She is tall with dark hair and eyes and is fastidious in dress. There is a friendliness about her that puts even strangers at ease. She is quick to recognize ability in others and is willing to lend a helping hand. Some few years ago she had a friend who designed and manufactured children's clothes. This friend was anxious to get her merchandise on the Los Angeles market. She wrote to Mrs. Thorpe to ask her if, without any embarrassment or inconvenience, she could introduce her to the buyer in the children's department of the most exclusive department store in Los Angeles where Mrs. Thorpe's fine handwork was retailed. A letter came back via air mail saying, \"Call me as soon as you arrive in Los Angeles, and I will be happy to make the appointment for you and help in any way I can.\" In the same letter she expressed joy in knowing of the friend's plans. She told how thrilling it was to her to encourage someone beginning in the creative field. \"Because,\" she continued, \"my work hasn't been all smooth sailing and without the help of friends and the Great Creator Himself, I wouldn't have attained such success. Then, too, I feel that anyone who can create in a small way, has something akin to that Great Creator.\" Just before the present world war Mrs. Thorpe went on a business trip to Europe. She hoped to gain inspiration and new ideas from Old World treasures. She also hoped to establish a European business whereby she could have beautiful, finished articles made by Old World craftsmen according to her designs, shipped to her Los Angeles office, bearing the label \"Made in (name of country) exclusively for Dorothy C. Thorpe.\" Being internationally known, her trip was made easy and interesting by European dealers and producers, as well as by connoisseurs of her art. Unfortunately, the war intervened and her venture had to be postponed until some future date. Not discouraged by the turn of affairs, she returned home sparkling with new ideas that could be realized in her own country. Mrs. Thorpe works out special orders for such well-known people as Ginger Rogers, Laraine Day, William Powell, Andy, of Amos and Andy fame, Clark Gable, the Duchess of Windsor, Leopold Stokowski, and many others. She is listed in Who's Who in American Art. She enjoys the friendship and esteem of fellow artisans. One of her greatest personal joys has been in the achievement of her two brothers. Both have been motion picture set designers. Guy left the business to act as an able factory representative for his sister. Claude has remained at R. K. O. where he is first assistant set decorator. Dorothy's love and interest in her sister Afton is a loving example of affection. She is proud of Afton's beautiful home in Cottonwood. Afton is also blessed with artistic talents.\n SHE IS OURS 605\nDOROTHY THORPE'S SHOP IN MAY COMPANY, WILSHIRE BLVD., LOS ANGELES\nThroughout her home are evidences of her fine needlework in linens, curtains, draperies, hooked rugs, etc. Also the color combinations of her home are restful and appropriate. When Mrs. Thorpe was asked for pictures to accompany this article, she wrote, \"In my opinion the Latter-day Saint Relief Society is one of the world's outstanding organizations, and we will be very proud indeed to have your Magazine publish an article on our work.\" This brief biography about one so worthy of recognition has been a pleasure to prepare. Dorothy Thorpe has risen high in her field, and we are proud that she is ours."

            "content": "RELIEF SOCIETY WAR AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES HE Relief Society annual report for 1942, published in the recent June-July issue of the Magazine, indicated for Relief Societies throughout the Church the extent of war and welfare services by the Society. Part of this report dealt with Relief Society sewing service at local Relief Society meetingssewing service for the Society and its members, for the Church Welfare Program, and for the Red Cross and other worthy community agencies. 'This report indicated that an average of nearly 29,000 women gave sewing service at each monthly work meeting to the extent of approximately 382,000 hours, during which 116,882 articles were com- | pleted. Of this total number of articles, the greatest number (38,381 or approximately one-third of the total) was made for the Red Cross, with 29,048 being made for Relief Society, 19,446 for bishops' storehouses, and 30,007 for hospitals and all other agencies. Clothing for children constituted the largest group, according to kinds of articles made. Next in importance were quilts, which, for one hundred years, have symbolized Relief Society sewing service. It was in the Society's second year, in a meeting held October Page 626 14, 1843, that Phebe M. Wheeler, the assistant secretary, proposed \"that a sewing society be appointed that garments and bed clothing may be made and given to such as are suffering cold and nakedness.\" Quilts made during 1942 numbered 13,034-and it is expected that quilts made during 1943 will greatly exceed this number, for 1943 is doubtless the greatest quilt-making year so far in Relief Society. In addition to the usual number of quilts made, the Society undertook an assignment by the Church Welfare Committee to fill an assignment in the ratio of one quilt to every one hundred Church members, these quilts to be turned into bishops' storehouses. In addition, the General Board of Relief Society recommended that all Societies in war risk areas provide themselves with ward first-aid supplies, including 12 quilts or blankets. Furthermore, the General Board also suggested that a final check be made to discover whether all families were adequately supplied with bedding, and urged that encouragement and assistance be given to help families complete their bedding supplies. Many stake and ward Relief Societies had already conducted bedding projects for the benefit of families with- NOTES FROM THE FIELD 627 OVER 100 QUILTS WERE DISPLAYED AT THIS RELIEF SOCIETY QUILTING IN THE EMERY WARD, EMERY STAKE, 1943 in their boundaries. 'The following reports from wards and stakes reflect the activities of the Society with respect to the quilt-making project for the Church Welfare Program, the bedding plans for the benefit of members, Red Cross sewing, and other war Services. Emery Stake (Utah) MYRLE B. JOHANSEN, stake secretary-treasurer, recently wrote as follows: \"A suggestion given in one of the bulletins from the General Board that Relief Societies encourage their members to repair | and make new bedding, while materials were available, resulted in a most profitable project in the Emery Ward of our stake. \"They called it the 'Help One Another Project,' and every woman in the ward was invited to participate. The project covered a period of two and one-half months, and' approximately 3,246 hours were spent in quilting. Over 158 quilts were made. At the time the accompanying picture was taken, over 100 quilts were displayed. Six quilts were made for Church Welfare at one time, and over eighty women were present. Light refreshments were served at every quilting. Wynona Petty is president of the Emery Ward. \"At the present time, this ward has a very worthy summer project for their visiting teachers. Each month a social is given in every district, at the home of a widow, a service star mother, or an aged sister. The program is made up by those living in the district and many participate who have not had the privilege of doing so before.\" Los Angeles Stake (California) EMMA LYM, secretary of the Beverly Hills Ward, reports: \"Our Relief Society anniversary celebration was a success in every respect. An old-fashioned quilting party was held on March 11. A pleasant program was presented during the quilting and a luncheon served. On March 17 a number of our members went to the Red Cross Blood Bank and gave blood donations. It was felt that no better way could be found to adequately commemorate the anniversary of the Society. \"For our closing party the entire group reported at the Red Cross center at the El Rodeo School in Beverly Hills on June 3. The morning was spent preparing surgical dressings and rolling bandages. The women found it an enjoyable as well as useful occupation. Lach _ sister brought a box lunch and at noon adjourned to Roxbury Park. Here lunches were exchanged and enjoyed. After lunch an informal program was presented for the pleasure of all present. \"We are happy to report that these activities of small service have been highly successful in increasing the spirit of cooperation and friendship among the members of Beverly Hills Ward.\" Young Stake (New Mexico) EMMA B. EVANS, president of the very small Relief Society at Shiprock, New Mexico, reported in June: \"We have made quilts and dresses and sold them in the store here. We have made molasses taffy, popcorn balls, etc., and sold them to the sweet-hungry school children. By May 26, which we had set as our $100 goal, we had purchased $100 worth of war bonds and sold quilts and two dresses besides. We have six members.\" Navajo-Zuni Mission (New Mexico) EMMA B. EVANS of Shiprock was recently appointed with her husband, President Ralph William Evans, to preside over the new Navajo-Zuni Mission. When she wrote in June, there were no organized Relief Societies among these Indian women, but many of them who were interested were assisting with the Sunday School and Primary Association meetings, and doing missionary work. She reported as follows her visit to Crystal, New Mexico, \"away up in the tops of the mountains\" where the only full-time missionary was stationed: \"This lady missionary had taught the Navajo women to make quilts. I wish you could see the two quilt tops they have made. One is put together with bright green and the other with a very bright yellow. The quilt blocks are perfect, every color blended and stitched as perfectly as their Navajo blankets are made. Instead of cutting their blocks as they would come on the material, the conventional flower design was in the center of each diamond, giving it an appliqued effect. Their faces shone when I told them that I would send the cotton for the first one, and how lovely they were. They intend to make and sell enough quilts to buy an organ or piano for their little church. \"You would thnill with pride if you were to see the little one-roomed church which they reconditioned with the help of Jim Collyer, the Mormon trader there. It has a good floor, newly painted walls, good benches, bright Navajo colors at the neatly curtained windows. Our visit was unexpected, but vases of evergreen and flowers adorned tables and  NOTES FROM THE FIELD windows, and Brother Polocca was on hand to take charge of the meeting. This new member has full charge since there are no missionaries there now. Just lately a protestant church there had six missionaries holding revival meetings, but this staunch new member held his ground and carried on in face of great opposition.\" Shelley Stake (Idaho) SADIE KIRKHAM, stake sewing leader, at the request of Annie B. Johnsen, stake Relief Society president, reported in 1942: \"In one Relief Society bedding project we have quilted 410 quilts. People who could afford to do so paid for the work, and the money was used to buy quilts and blankets for those who could not afford to pay. Then the stake Relief Society cooperated in a government mattress project. We made 207 mattresses. Through the applications for mattresses we learned the real needs of the people in our stake better than we could have found out in any other way. It has been a big undertaking, but we have enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing we have helped people to have warm bedding who have never had it before, and we surely need it in Idaho.\" Southern Arizona Stake (Arizona) GLADYS E. HUISH, president of Southern Arizona Stake Relief Society, reported in 1942 details of this stake's bedding project: \"First, we decided to ask each member to 629 have enough bedding on hand to last for five years and gave them a suggestive list to go by. To help the women with their quilts, each ward organization offered to quilt one quilt without charge for each member who would prepare and furnish her own material; some wards quilted one and tied one for each member. Of course, there were some who did not need any quilts made and a few who could not afford to buy materials. For the latter, the association bought the material and quilted the quilts. We suggested for the sheets and slips that they take advantage of the layaway plan early before prices were raisedwhich many did. We made each ward president responsible for her own members. \"When we took a survey early in October, we found that 70 per cent of our women had enough bedding for 5 years, many others for 3 years, some for only one, and a very few who hadn't done anything. Our presidents will still work with these few. \"In order to get so many quilts quilted most of the wards met regularly in work meetings each Tuesday allsummer. Some held all-day work meetings every Tuesday. For our clothing project we asked the families to try to have enough clothes besides the ones they were wearing to last children for one year, and adults for two years.

Earth;.... That Christ will reign personally upon the Lesson Aim: To show that after the cleansing of the earth by fire and the destruction of all wicked people upon the earth, that Christ will reign personally during the Millenium, and that during the millennial reign things not yet accomplished will be fulfilled preparatory to the end of the world. CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 20, First and Second Advents The facts of our Lord's birth in the flesh, of His thirty and three years of life among mortals, of His ministry, sufferings, and death, are accepted as attested history. \"In the meridian of time\" Christ was born to earth, amid humble surroundings. His coming had been _ heralded through the previous centuries, even from the dawn of human existence. Every important incident connected with His birth, life, death, triumphal resurrection, and ultimate glo as King, Lord and God, had been predicted. Judah and Israel had been told to prepare for the coming of the Page 630 TALMAGE'S, ARTICLES OF FAITH Anointed One; yet when He came to His own, they received Him not. Similarly benighted are they who reject the prophetic evidence of His second coming, and who fail to read the signs of the times, which declare the event, at once glorious and tertible, to be near. Christ's Second Coming Predicted and Signs Described; Biblical Prophecies The prophets of the Old Testament, and those of Book of Mormon record who lived and wrote before the era of Christ, had little to say regarding the second coming of the LESSON DEPARTMENT Lord in comparison with their numerous and explicit predictions concerning His first advent. The Lord's second advent was foretold by these prophets, however, as the scriptures abundantly aver (Ps. 50:1, 3; Isa. 35:4, 5-10; 40:10; Jude 14, 15; Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:60, etc.). Jesus taught the disciples that His mission in the flesh was to be of short duration, and that He would come again to earth, for we find them inquiring in this wise: \"Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?\" In reply, our Lord detailed many of the signs of the latter times (Matt. Chap. 24; Luke Chap. 21), the last and greatest of which He thus stated: \"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come,\" (Matt. 24:14). With great clearness, Jesus spoke of the worldliness in which the children of men had continued to indulge, even to the eve of the deluge, and on the day of the fiery destruction which befell the Cities of the Plains, and added: \"Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed\" (Luke 17:26-30). At the time of the ascension, as the apostles stood gazing into the firmament where a cloud had hidden the resurrected Lord from sight, they became aware of the presence of two visitants in white apparel, who said: \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven\" (Acts 1:11). 631 Among Book of Mormon Prophecies 'Among Book of Mormon prophecies it is sufficient to consider here the personal assurances of Christ at the time of His ministrations to the Nephites in His resurrected state. In promising the three disciples the desire of their hearts, He said, \"Ye shall live to behold all the doings of the Father unto the children of men, even until all things shall be fulfilled according to the will of the Father, when I shall come in my glory with the powers of heaven\" (III Nephi 28:7-8). Rd The Word-of Modern Revelation The word of modern revelation is no less sure regarding the appointed advent of the Redeemer (Doctrine and Covenants 33:17; 34:6-7; 45: 37-44). The Precise Time of Christ's Coming The precise time of His coming has not been made known unto man (Doctrine and Covenants 49:7; Matt. 25:13; 24:42, 44; Mark 13: 33 35; Luke 12:40; etc.). His coming will be a surprise to those who have ignored His warnings, and who have failed to watch. Christ's Reign; The Kingdom The scriptures abound with declarations that the Lord will yet reign among His people, and that His kingdom will be everlasting (Ps. 10:16; 29:10; 145:13; 146:10; Jer. 10:10; Dan. 4:34-37; 7:27; Micah 4: 7; Luke 1:33; Rev. 11:15). Kingdom and Church Although the phrases \"kingdom of heaven,\" \"kingdom of God,\" 632 \"kingdom of Christ\" or simply \"kingdom\" may be used interchangeably, a careful study of the context in each instance may be necessary to a proper comprehension of the writer's intent (Doctrine and Covenants 65: 2, 5-6). At the time of His glorious advent, Christ will be accompanied by the hosts of righteous ones who have already passed from earth; and saints who are still alive on earth are to be quickened and caught up to meet Him, then to descend with Him as partakers of His glory (Doctrine and Covenants 88:91-98). With Him too will come Enoch and his band of the pure in heart; and a union will be effected with the kingdom of God, or that part of the kingdom of heaven previously established as the Church of Christ on earth; and the kingdom on earth will be one with that in heaven. Then will be realized a fulfillment of the Lord's own prayer, given as a pattern to all who pray: \"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\" (Matt. 6:10). The Millennium During the millennial era, both mortal and immortal beings will tenant the earth, and communion with heavenly powers will be common. Vicarious work for the dead will continue with renewed fervor. Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed again he shall only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of the earth (Doctrine and Covenants 43:30-31). Then the earth will pass to its celestial condition and become a fit abode for the glorified sons and daughters of God. The Millennium should be considered as a sabbatical eraa thousand years of peace, wherein enmity between man and beast shall cease, and love shall rule (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:65; Isa. 11:6-9; 65: 17, 20-25; Doctrine and Covenants 29:11, 22-23; 43:30-31; 63:49-51; 77: 12), SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE Suggested Songs \"Come, Thou Glorious Day of Promise,\" by Alex Neibaur, Relief Society Songs, page 52; Latter-day Saint Hymns, No. 275. \"Come, O Thou King of Kings,\" by P.

LESSON DEPARTMENT Pictures Well-selected pictures add interest to the lesson and create an appropriate atmosphere. Famous pictures of Christ might be used in connection with this lesson. (Pictures may be obtained at small cost from the Perry Picture Co.; Malden, Massachusetts. ) Suggested Questions and Study Helps (Note: In early editions of The Articles of Faith by James E. Talmage, a series of questions and suggestive exercises were included. The following were prepared by the author for this particular chapter: ) 1. Compare the conditions attending Christ's first advent, with those predicted for His second coming. 2. Cite scriptural prophecies regarding the second coming of Christ, with attendant signs: 1, Biblical; 2, Book of Mormon; 3, modern. 3. What evidence have you to prove that the predicted second coming of Christ is near at hand? 4. What is known as to the time of His coming? 5- Show by scripture that Christ is to reign as King on earth. 6. Demonstrate the relation between the kingdom of God and the Church of Christ. 7. Show the distinctive sense in which kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven are spoken of in modern revelation. 8. What will be the position of honest and honorable men who are not members of the Church when the kingdom of heaven is established? 9. What is the Millennium? 10. Give scriptural authority for your belief as to the conditions that are to characterize the Millennium. 11. What will be the condition of Satan during and after the Millennium? 633 Suggestions for the Use of the Questions The question is a \"major mainspring to mental activity.\" The question-and-answer method is one of the important teaching methods and, if properly handled, may be made to contribute effectively to the aims of teaching. Questions should be clear and concise. One important purpose of questions is to stimulate and direct thinking; that is, to start the class members on a line of thought and then to direct their thought movement to a given conclusion or goal. The use of questions should be carefully planned. They should contribute to the development of the lesson and to the realization of lesson aims. The \"Suggested Questions and Study Helps\" may be used in a variety of ways: 1. They may be used by the class leader _as a guide for her preparation of the lesson. 2. The entire list of questions and study helps may be given to the members of the class as a guide for the preparation of the lesson by all the class members. 3. Certain questions may be assigned to individual class members for special reports. These reports should be limited as to time and introduced by the class leader at the proper places in the presentation of her lesson. 4. Three or four of the questions could be given to the entire class for special thought and preparation, and the remaining questions given to individuals for special preparation. 5. A question could be assigned to a committee of three or four members the month before the lesson presentation. On the day of the lesson presentation, one of the three members could report for the committee. This method could be used to give many members in a large class definite assignments. The pre-meeting of the committee would give the members an opportunity of getting better acquainted with the lesson and with each other. 6. These questions could be used as a review of the lesson. Note: The class members should be urged to bring the standard works of the Church. They should be urged to study these lessons before they are discussed in class. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Discourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925: Christ will not cease his labors pertaining to this earth until it is redeemed and sanctified, ready to be presented spotless to the Father Page 45. The Savior has not finished his work, and cannot receive the fulness of his glory until the influence and power of the wicked are overcome and brought into subjection. When the wicked inhabitants of the earth, the beasts of the field, fowls of the air, fish of the sea, all mineral substances, and all else pertaining to this earth, are overcome, then he will take the kingdom, present it to the Father, and say, \"Here is the work you gave me to doyou made the appointmentI have wrought faithfully, and here are my brethren and sisters who have wrought with me. We have wrought faithfully, together; we have overcome the flesh, hell and the Devil. I have overcome, they have followed in my footsteps, and here are all thou hast given me; I have lost none, except the sons of perdition.Page 45. When he again visits this earth, he will come to thoroughly purge his kingdom from wickedness, and, as ruler of the nations, to dictate and administer to them as the heir to the kingdom; and the Gentiles will be as much mistaken in regard to his second advent as the Jews were in relation to the firstPage 46. Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, 1938 edition: Signs of Second Coming Have Commenced Mea profess to prophesy. I will prophesy that the signs of the coming of the Son of Man are already commenced. One pestilence will desolate after another. We shall soon have war and bloodshed. The moon will be turned into blood. I testify of these things, and that the coming of the Son of Man is nigh, even at your doors. If our souls and our bodies are not looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man; and after we are dead, if we are not looking forth, we shall be among those who are calling for the rocks to fall upon them. Page 160. Hearts of Children Turn to Fathers The hearts of the children of men will have to be turned to the fathers, and the fathers to the children, living or dead, to prepare them for the coming of the Son of Man. If Elijah did not come, the whole earth would be smitten.Page 160. Judah must return, Jerusalem must be rebuilt, and the temple, and water come out from under the temple, and the waters of the Dead Sea be healed. It will take some time to rebuild the walls of the city and the temple, etc.; and all this must be done before the Son of Man will make His appearance. 'There will be wars and rumors of wars, signs in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, the sun turned into darkness and the moon to blood, earthquakes in divers places, the seas heaving beyond their bounds; then will appear onc grand sign of the Son of Man in heaven. But what will the world do? They will say it is a planet, a comet, etc. But the Son of Man will come as the sign of the coming of the Son of Man, which will be as the light of morning cometh out of the east.Pages 286-287.  LESSON DEPARTMENT 635 Visiting Teachers Messages to the Home Sources of Strength Lesson 4The Development of Strength Through Work Tuesday, January 4, 1944 WORK, we repeat, is a panacea for the ills of life. It is a source of joy and the price of things most worthwhile, the only path to be pursued that will bring satisfaction and victory to each individual. To quote Carlyle, \"Labor is worship,\" and he declares it to be the greatest discovery beneath the sun. No man nor woman can be truly happy who does not carry some responsibility and do some useful work. Blessed is the man who has found his work, who can lose himself in it, who gets joy out of it, who comes to it in the morning with gladness in his heart. To quote Proverbs 22:29: \"Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.\" There is a well-known story of a farmer who, on his deathbed, called his three idle sons about him to impart to them an important secret. \"My sons,\" said he, \"a great treasure is hidden in the estate which I am about to leave to you.\" The old man gasped.. \"Where is it hid?\" exclaimed the sons. \"I am about to tell you,\" said the old man. \"You will have to dig for it.' But his breath failed him before he could impart the weighty secret, and he died. Forthwith, the sons set to work to spade and dig the long-neglected field, and they turned over every sod and clod upon the estate. They discovered no treasure, but they learned to work; and when the field was sown and the harvest came, lo, the yield was prodigious, in consequence of the thorough tilling which it had received. Then it was that they discovered the treasure of which their wise father had advised themit was the yield of the estate from their own labors. Happiness never resides in what an individual has, but always in what the individual does. \"The more a man works, the longer he lives. 'The less he works, the sooner he dies.\" There is only one person for whom there is no hope, and that's the idler. \"The idler shall not eat the bread of the laborer.\" Much work may be required in making a home and keeping it. 'This is often hard and monotonous work, but commonplace as it may seem, it is vitally important. Home building, in its truest meaning, is one of the greatest of the fine arts. The home is the center of happiness, a source of civilization. Work Thank God for the might of it, The ardor, the urge, the delight of it, Work that springs from the heart's desire Setting the soul and the brain on fire. Oh, what is so good as the heat of it, And what is so glad as the beat of it, And what is so kind as the stern command Challenging brain and heart and hand? Angela Morgan If the Almighty should come to me with complete success in his right hand and cternal struggle in his left, I would choose the left.Socrates. Discussion 1. What are some of the physical values of work? The psychological, particularly in times of mental or emotional strain? 2. Give specific instances from Church history in which the importance of work has been emphasized by Church leaders.

Of all the ways of getting on in the world, the shortest and best is to make people believe that it will be to their interest to help you along.La Bruyere. THE home affords the best environment for learning management, and family cooperation is an important factor in the successful management of homes in today's busy world. The parent needs to realize the importance of housekeeping experience for the child as a means of development, and as an expeditious method of solving housekeeping problems. Pressure of many kinds causes mothers to say, \"It takes less time to do it myself.\" This statement reflects a lack of recognition of the important place management plays in living in a modern world, as well as the value of family effort in housekeeping. At different periods of time, the customs and habits of people have differed. 'The problems of housekeeping and homemaking have changed with each succeeding period. Weare confronted today with a situation wherein that which we have must be given great care, because of the difficulties of replacement. This is particularly true if we would preserve, in beauty, our floors and floor coverings. 'Their attractive appearance and the service which they give depend in large measure upon how they are cared for. Volumes have been written upon the subject of floors and their finishings, coverings, and care. Hard and  LESSON DEPARTMENT soft pine, maple, ash, and oak are the woods most frequently used for floors. Soft pine has the advantage of being least expensive. Oak is considered by many persons to be the best wood for floor uses, particularly if it is quarter-sawed. Maple, however, is preferred by those who like light-colored wood floors. Wood floors that are stained, painted, oiled or waxed have grown steadily in favor and are now in general use. These floors are usually partly covered by rugs, large or small. There is much to be said in favor of these finished floors. When well kept, they are very beautiful; and they may be kept so by daily dusting with a dry mop and an occasional thorough cleaning and refinishing. Rugs used on these floors may be cleaned as often as necessary without great effort and are easily reversed, which lengthens their wear. Thus the finished-wood and rugcovered floor is more sanitary and has other advantages over the fully carpeted floor. However, much may also be said in favor of the fully carpeted floor. Some people object to any bare floor, particularly when it is waxed, because of the danger of slipping. This, however, can easily be overcome by using, where traffic occurs, non-skid matting under small rugs. Many people think that wax makes the most desirable and lasting fioor finish for living rooms. The expense of this finish is somewhat more than a varnish finish because of the great amount of labor required. To keep a waxed floor in good condition it should be thoroughly cleaned at least once a year with turpentine or solvent and steel wool, 637 and then given two coats of highgrade floor wax. A soiled spot or stain may be removed from a waxfinished floor with turpentine or solvent, the spot treated, and the place covered anew with wax. With what should one cover the kitchen floor? Of all the kitchen floor coverings in use at the present time, linoleum seems to be the most satisfactory. A linoleum floor is resilient and easy to walk tipon. Inlaid linoleum is perhaps the most satisfactory kind. Good linoleum is about a quarter of an inch thick and inlaid on canvas. Inlaid linoleum has the pattern or color extending from the surface through to the burlap base. Printed linoleum has a pattern printed on the surface only, and constant washing soon obliterates the pattern. Linoleum may be kept in condition by waxing at frequent intervals. It may be washed with mild soap and water. The surface may be protected by a linoleum lacquer in place of, wax or varnish. Lacquer or varnish preserves the pattern of printed linoleum, but soon wears off in places that are most used, unless measures are taken to protect these spots. Linoleum with the pattern worn off may be painted and given an entirely new and fresh appearance. The manufacture of both linoleum and carpets is greatly cut down at the present time due to the war. The mills are weaving carpets on a monthly basis only. All dealers are on allotments, and the allotments are small. All-wool carpets are no longer made. All-cotton carpets and tugs, as well as those which are a mixture of cotton and woolsometimes cotton, wool, and rayonare now all that is being made. The various kinds of rugs and carpets which have been on the market until very recently are too numerous to discuss in this short lesson. One of the most satisfactory floor covering for living rooms, from the point of view of many decorators is broadloom carpet in a soft, dark, solid color. It must be remembered, however, in selecting rugs or carpeting that walls and floors are a background for other furnishings. Therefore, patterns and colors that \"rise up and hit you\"that is, startling colors and, in general, large designs are to be avoided. All rugs and carpets improve in glossiness and beauty under proper care. Cheap or expensive, they should be vacuum cleaned in the direction they were woven. Rugs should never be beaten or whipped. They should never be hung over a line. Small rugs should be brushed with a whisk broom in preference to sweeping them. Suggestions for Study 1. Make a visit to your carpet and linoleum dealer and procure linoleum samples and samples of carpets of different types of weave, material, etc. Discuss with the class the characteristics and qualities of each and give suggestions for the care of each. 2. Name several precautions to be taken in the care of large and small rugs. 3. What are the differences between paste, liquid, and self-polishing waxes, and where can each be used to the best advantage? 4. Distinguish between battleship, plain, jaspe and marbleized, inlaid, and printed linoleums.

I will show you oneyou find the other three. IT is realized that the business of housekeeping has not kept pace with the tremendous advancement in other lines of human endeavor, that the wonderful discoveries in science and the developments in the arts only slowly and partially have been applied to the problems of home life. However, enough has been applied to the home to make a study of modern housekeeping methods both interesting and profit Confucius. Able. In a short course, such as we are presenting in Relief Society, we cannot discuss all that is new and better in housekeeping methods, but it is hoped that enough information will be given to help class members with some of their housekeeping problems and to stimulate them to seek further for efficient ways of doing their household tasks. In wall coverings one has the choice of many materialspaint,  LESSON DEPARTMENT kalsomine, wallpapers of many kinds, grass cloth, etc. In deciding what covering to use, consideration must be given to beauty, service, and cost. In selecting a wall covering one must consider what is to be required of it. Is color that harmonizes with room furnishings of first importance, or is texture more important than color? Will the wall covering have to withstand a great deal of cleaning, or may it go for several years with only light dusting? Is the cost too great in proportion to the service the covering will render, or will its durability justify the cost? It is important also to decide how much labor will be involved in covering the walls, and whether or not the person to do the work understands the proper handling of his materials. A good paint job is in many respects preferable to any other type. Of wall finish. Although it is more costly than most other types, it is also more durable. Wall paints are both glossy and dull and, of course, have a wide range of color possibilities. The colors of good paints fade very little, so that a color well chosen may give pleasure for several years. Paint is used over plastered walls. Enamel paint is particularly costly as a material, requiring both time and skill to apply well. It usually produces a glossy surface not often desirable over an entire wall, except in kitchens and bathrooms where it is considered by many persons to be quite ideal. Instructions for the use of paints may be secured when they are purchased, however, surfaces should _always be clean, dry, and smooth. If the surface is covered with old paint, it should be sandpapered in order 639 to make it smooth. One should never paint over a surface that has been waxed without scrubbing off all the wax and without making sure the surface is dry. If any mending is needed it should be done before painting is started. Only new or well-cleaned brushes should be used, and they should be of a suitable width for the work to be done. Painted surfaces can be well cleaned by washing with mild soap and water or water softener and water. It has been found quite successful to apply a thin coat of cooked starch over a new paint job. This starch solution when dry leaves an invisible film over the surface which helps to make the washing job much easier. After painted walls have been once washed, the starch solution should again be applied to reduce hard work for the next cleaning period. Kalsomine as a wall finish is inexpensive. It is mixed with water, is comparatively quick to apply, and dries within two or three hours. It comes in a variety of colors and, though not as durable as paint is satisfactory on plastered walls where changes must be made frequently and where the cost of material is a consideration. Surprisingly good effects can be secured when kalsomine is well applied. Skilled workmen can so handle it as to produce almost any shade desired, and the surface obtained is dull with much the same texture as wallpaper. Frequently walls must be sized with a special sizing solution to obtain even results. Unfortunately, the colors of kalsomine fade in sunlight. Compared with paint, kem-tone, wallpaper, or canvassed walls, it is at the bottom of the list in cost. Kem-tone and similar products are new wall finishes which have recently come on the market. They are less expensive than paint, but more expensive than kalsomine. They come in paste form and have to be mixed with water. They have been very popular this past season and give beautiful results when properly applied. Instructions for their use are given on the container. Paper, as a wall covering, is so commonly used that infinite variety in color, texture, and durability has been developed. The price range is from a few cents per roll to several dollars. Wallpaper suitable in color and design for any room in a house may now be had. Small design in an allover pattern of much the same hue, but of slightly different values from that of the paper background gives a richness of texture without emphasizing design. Such papers can be successfully used in rooms where pictures are to be hung. Papers of large separate designs should be reserved for large wall areas not otherwise decorated. Wallpaper comes in washable and non-washable grades. Most wallpapers are best cleaned with the dough-type wallpaper cleaners now on the market everywhere. When propertly applied to the wall, canvas has the advantage of having rich texture and durability, but the initial cost is high as compared with most wallpapers. With restarching it can be freshened from time to time. Ceilings are usually light so as to give an impression of spaciousness. They should not be white except in white rooms, but should be keyed to the wall color in order to harmonize with it. 'The material used to cover the ceiling is usually the same as that used on the walls. If the room is too high, its height may be reduced in appearance by using a \"dropped ceiling\" or a darker shade of covering. If the ceiling is low, a striped paper, with stripes extending from base-board to ceiling, will make the ceiling appear higher than it is in reality. The woodwork is part of the background of any room, and should not be conspicuous in line or color. It may be stained, varnished or painted. Many commercial products are now on the market for cleaning woodwork, but mild soap and water will usually remove soil and spots with little or no injury to the finish. Questions for Discussion 1. What are some of the important factors to be considered in selecting the proper type of wall finish for a room? The proper kind of woodwork finish?. How does the locality in which you live affect your selection of wall coverings? How does it affect the cleaning problem? 3. Give some practical suggestions on how to properly clean painted walls with a minimum of effort; also painted woodwork. 4. Discuss some of the problems involved in covering one type of wall covering with another type; for example, kalsomine over wallpaper; wallpaper over paint; paint over kalsomine, Reference America's Housekeeping Book, Chapter 13, pp. 157-168  LESSON DEPARTMENT 641 Literature The Bible as Literature Lesson 4The Bible Ballad Tuesday, January 18, 1944 HEROIC days produce stories that are often transmitted through ballads down the ages. Lads may be briefly suggested by calling them story-songs. Tales of Robin Hood and His Merry Men are. Examples of this type of literature. In verse form, easily learned by heart, the popular stories of these Englishmen, who had taken to the greenwoods in protest against Norman tyranny, were \"half said, half sung\" as Scott puts it, and passed from generation to generation. In a lyric, a story is just suggested. In a ballad, the story is sketched. In a narrative, the story is told with detail. The ballad, in other words, is a story in essentials, given musicallyoften with \"echo lines\" to bind it more closely together. Generally, the ballad deals with but one dramatic incident. Rhythmic effects are usually distinctive, often striking. Ballads of the Robin Hood type are, of course,-not to be found in the Bible. Indeed, there are but few selections in Bible literature that may be classified as truly of the ballad type. One reason for this may perhaps be that Bible stories are usually almost as compressed as a ballad. Another, of course, is that Bible literature has its own distinguishing These balcharacteristics. In form, it does not parallel closely other literary forms. One of the examples that approaches the ballad type is found in Judges Five, Deborah's Song. A comparative study of this chapter with that of Chapter Four, helps one to get a clearer idea of the straight narrative story, and that of the ballad or song-story type. Back of these two chapters is of course the larger story leading up to the conquest of the Promised Land, and the distribution of the Tribes of Israel over their reclaimed realm. Joshua, you will remember, after crossing the Jordan, and after the triumph over Jericho, whose walls fall before his army, sweeps through the land of Canaan, defeating most of the tribes that have taken possession of it. Yet, despite the swiftness of his conquest, he fails to give heed to the Lord and sweep away the enemies of Israel \"root and branch.\" This failure brings on a series of troubles. Round about the conquered realm are various peoples Midianites, Hittites, Philistines, and othersready to fight to get back the lands from which they have been driven. After the distributing ofthe Twelve Tribes over the various parts of Canaan allotted to them, there is 642 no central government from which they can be directed, especially in a military sense. A high priest is what may be called the chief ruler and he is concerned, it would seem, with administering spiritual matters. Enemies, taking advantage of this, begin to prey upon the tribes most vulnerable to attack. At the outset, the trouble comes mainly in the great plain of Esdraelon, an open country near the center of the land of Canaan. Gradually these attacks by the enemy are increased, until something has to be done to meet them. In Judges Four we are told the story in characteristic Biblical style, with straight, clear strokes and concreteness. It begins: And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead. And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. Thus the story continues to move forward step by step, telling of the defeat of Sisera and of his flight and death at the hand of the wife of Heber the Kenite. It is a straight prose narrative rising to a climax with the final victory over Jabin the king and his destruction by the Israelites. Naturally, at the conclusion of this triumph over an enemy who had enslaved them for a score of years, there would be an outburst of rejoicing. It comes in much the same spirit as that which followed the escape of the Israelites at the Red Sea, though in a somewhat different form. In Deborah's Song (Judges Five) we have the story sketched with bursts of music portraying various emotions as the triumph is depicted. Dr. Moulton in his Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 223-225, presents the Biblical ballad in part as follows: (See also The Bible Designed to be Read As Living Literature, by Ernest Bates, pp. 180-181.) Deborah's Song For that the leaders took the lead in Israel For that the people offered themselves willingly Bless ye the Lord! In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, The highways were unoccupied, And the travelers walked through byways; The rulers ceased in Israel, They ceased LESSON DEPARTMENT Until that I, Deborah, arose, That I arose a mother in Israel. They chose new gods; There was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen Among forty thousand in Israel? Then the people of the Lord went down to the gates Awake, awake Deborah, Awake, awake, utter a song:  Arise, Barak, And lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan, In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money! They fought from heaven, The stars in their courses fought against Sisera. The river Kishon swept them away, That ancient river, the river Kishon! Oh my soul, march on with strength! Then did the horsehoofs stamp By reason of the pransings The pransing of their strong ones. Following the above lines comes the rest of the story, telling of the death of the king, of the mother looking vainly for his return in triumph. Then with swift stroke the ballad ends with So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. It is. Timely here to retell a story that came out of the reconquest of 643 the land 'of Palestine during World War I. During a battle with the Turks, a detachment of English lancers, it is said, made an attempt to charge the enemy across the '\"'ancient river Kishon\"named in the foregoing poem. Several of these horsemen went down in the quicksand of the river. When the leader was brought before the commander to report the disaster to his troops, he was asked, \"Don't you ever read your Bible? It was this same old river that helped bring defeat to Sisera.\" Discussion and Activities 1. Explain the basic meaning of the term ballad. What rather old-fashioned song do you know that is ballad-like? Why? 2. So far as the story part goes, what is the essential difference between a lyric and a ballad? A ballad and a story? Illustrate. 3. Read all the story of Deborah as given in Judges Four. Then read the storysong as given in Judges Five. What is one basic difference that you observe between the two accounts of the same incident? 4. Find in Deborah's Song (Judges Five) some lines (two or three of them) that seem especially musical. 5. Choose from this Biblical ballad two or more words or phrases that bring a vivid picture to you. 6. Try reading parts of the ballad (Judges Five) aloud to note the vivid word pictures they bring.

Our nation is that one among all the nations of the earth which holds in its hands the fate of the coming years. We enjoy exceptional advantages, and we are menaced by exceptional dangers; and all signs indicate that we shall either fail greatly or succeed greatly.... We shall never be successful over the dangers that confront us; we shall never achieve true greatness, nor reach the lofty ideals which the founders and preservers of our mighty Federal Republic have set before us, unless we are Americans in heart and soul, in spirit and purpose.Theodore Roosevelt. E have tried to show in the preceding lessons of this course that the United States has republican or representative form of government, and that the sacred rights and privileges of it are common to all its people. Its grant of religious and civic liberty to all its citizens is one of the noblest gifts to mankind in history, and the truest thing that can be said of our Government is that only human beings of a high degree of mental and moral fitness can appreciate its gifts, for the more perfect people become, the less control by laws do they need. Our Government was grounded in religion, and though religion did not become a part of its political system, it was virtually incorporated into the feelings and lives of the people. This can easily be accounted for. The Christian sects of Europe found asylum in America before the Revolutionary War, and the Constitution of the United States provided for freedom to worship God as people wished. The American people have naturally been religious, and allied to their religious character is reverence for the Founding Fathers who dedicated their fortunes and pledged their sacred honor for the creation of the United States. When the first Continental Congress met in Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia, September 5, 1774, delegates from all the Colonies, except, Georgia, had come to talk over their rights as Englishmen and to  LESSON DEPARTMENT make protests to the King of England because of grievances against the Government. This Congress led to the Second Continental Congress which issued to the world the Declaration of Independence. At the first session of the Congress, it was moved and seconded that the assembly be opened with prayer. While some objections were raised to the motion, it was finally carried and the Reverend Jacob Duche, Rector of Christ's Church in Philadelphia, was called in, and he opened the session with a fervent prayer. From that time to the present, every session of Congress has been opened by divine invocation, and the custom has become common in all the states when their legislative bodies meet. There is significance in the fact that the First Continental Congress was opened by prayer. It means that from the first our Government was dedicated to God, and the land consecrated to His holy purposes. 'They were select groups of Englishmen who settled these shores. Deep were their ideals of religion; holy was their concept of home life. They had as a rule been persecuted, but the people who go into a new country and have a long and perilous journey to make, develop unusual courage and determination, strong initiative, and strong convictions. As soon as the struggle for existence was over, the people began to assert themselves in new institutions. Town and county governments were developed, and these units of government were democratic, for the people met in meetings and made their own laws and appointed their own officers to enforce the laws made. Universal education was encouraged, and people 645 were free to work out their own destiny. Many new institutions were evolved, and women were freer than their sisters in the Old World. They occupied a more important place in society. Class distinction was abolished, and birth and money counted for nothing in redeeming the new country. A dominant individualism grew up, and ideals of equality, freedom of opportunity, and faith in the common man became deeply rooted in this New World. With the development of the country and the quest for the unknown, the people came to have a clearly defined conception of what \"democracy\" meant. All had a right to take part in government, both local and national. All had the right to vote for representatives to state and national legislative assemblies and for the men who should execute the laws. Citizenship in our country is a sacred opportunity and a power whereby homes, schools, churches, and civic life may be maintained for the best good of all. Citizenship requires the subordination of private interests to the public good. This naturally carries with it training in the great truth that man does not live for himself alone, but for the good of others. Good citizenship cannot exist without a deep love of home and country, for the state or city is not a mere corporation but a group of people who govern themselves, that they may have happiness and contentment. The state has a soul, and its essential greatness is its humanity. Good citizenship must conform to the political aims which we profess and to the political ideals which we cherish. In America we have what has always been called the \"democratic feeling,\" this respect of man for man, a sense of justice that is not satisfied until justice shall be the cornerstone of our Government. Our traditions hold sacredly to the ideal that men must try to think right and do right according to the highest principles of Christian ethics. God had a directive purpose in the formation of this nation, and the spirit in which the Government was established is related to the Spirit of God. The terrible war going on today is a struggle for righteousness against wrong, a struggle to maintain the true democracy of mankind over tyranny and slavery. Behind all democratic government there is a firm conviction of the divinity of man, which expresses itself in just and equitable laws. There is a call of God to nations as well as to men to maintain the gift of freedom that is conducive to the growth of the spiritual life of people. Our units of government like the state, county, and city are units of culture which make for civilization, and \"civilization\" was clearly and nobly defined by the Lord Chief Justice Russel of England when he said: \"Civilization is not dominion, wealth, material luxury; nay not even a great literature. Its true signs are thought for the poor and suffering, chivalrous regard and respect for women, the frank recognition of human brotherhood, irrespective of color or nation or religion; the narrowing of mere force as a governing factor in the world, the love of ordered freedom and abhorrence of what is mean and cruel and vile.\" The Latter-day Saints believe that to save the ideals of our democracy the people must have a stronger and more intelligent devotion to them. The Constitution of the United States gives us the democratic emphasis upon the value of life, and the right of the individual to attain unto the fullest development of his life. This has its origin in the religious and moral concepts of the Gospel which can supply democracy with an indispensable, fulfilling faith. Our Government with its Constitution is a tie that will bind the American people into a common brotherhood, and it will lead the way to other higher and spiritual unions. It blesses our efforts and it ennobles our lives. A few years ago, President Eliot of Harvard University made a statement well worth remembering. America, he said, has made five important contributions to civilization: first, we have done more than any other people to further peace keeping, and to substitute legal arbitration for the brute conflict of war; second, we have set a splendid example of the broadest religious toleration -even though Holland had first shown us how; third, we have made evident the wisdom of universal manhood suffrage; fourth, by our welcoming newcomers from all parts of the earth, we have proved that men belonging to a great variety of races are fit for political freedom; finally, we have succeeded in diffusing material well-being among the whole population to an extent without parallel in any other country of the world. These contributions to civilization are all of them the result of the practical side of the American character. The American people have retained the idealism and stability of character of their forefathers, and  LESSON DEPARTMENT they have a divine faith in their country, their Government, and in the people. The faith remains today, and for this reason there is a fineness to American character which will not allow America to become so seriously infected as to be destroyed by the false \"isms\" of Europe and other. Parts of the world. Americans are growing in religious feeling, for they are discovering that religion is the foundation of freedom and justice. It may be said today as it was said by a statesman over a hundred years ago: I see the dawn of a new and illustrious vision. I see the nation rising from its present depression with a chastened, but good spirit. I see education awakened, a spirit of sobriety ruling in work and in manners, a higher self-respect invigorating | our institutions, and the bonds of our government strengthened by a holier attachment. The building of this nation has been a long, solemn, and sacred task. It is the work of many generations of men and women who have conceived lofty ideals, and who, without regard to party, religious faith or section, \"whether up in the pine 647 forests of Maine or over across the continent in the orange fields of California, or down on the plantations of the sunny South, have wrought for freedom, for liberty, for stability, for justice.\" The American people have in a singular sense regarded themselves as the instruments of Providence in the working out of a great Government and a mighty civilization. The sacredness of our citizenship will never be given up so long as we love freedom and culture, nobility and honesty, and so long as we have respect for one another and a deep and abiding faith in the Gospel of -the Lord Jesus Christ. Questions and Topics for Discussion 1. Discuss the principles of rghteousness that lie at the root of our Government. 2. Why do we hold the Constitution of our country as sacred?. 3. What is meant by the expression: \"A government of the people?\" 4. If you designate a man or woman as a good citizen, just what do you mean? 5. Discuss the statement of Theodore Roosevelt at the beginning of this lesson. Stories from the Book of Mormon For optional use of Relief Societies in stakes and missions in countries other than the United States, in lieu of social science lessons. Lesson 3Nephi, a Leader in the Land of Promise Tuesday, January 25, 1944 Note: For the full effect of this lesson it is imperative that the teacher and class have at hand the Book of Mormon. Lesson Objective: To show the rewards of righteousness. EPHI, the son of Lehi, was truly a great leader and a man of faith. Of him it can be said, he sought first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all things were added unto him (Matt. 6:33). He - had learned in the tender years of his youth to honor his parents, and therefore he found it not hard to believe the accounts his father told of visions received from God. This parental example of seeking out the Lord led Nephi also to desire a direct answer to his prayers, with the result that God revealed himself unto Nephi and explained to him the need for a Savior and the necessity of a plan of salvation. Other things too were made. Known to Nephi. He was told he should become a ruler and a teacher of his brethren, and that he would be given charge of the sacred records of his people. These records were to be of great importance in the latter days in convincing both Jew and Gentile of the mission of the Messiah. Concerning the establishment, by Nephi, of a new nation in a new world, we read: \"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land. And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land. And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the earth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And... They did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were blessed in abundance. And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And as we did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper\" (I Nephi 18:22-25). At another period sometime later, when there had been a division of the original group who landed upon the shores of the New World, Nephi wrote of those over whom he had been called to preside: \"And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance. And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands. And it came to pass that they would that I should be their king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king; nevertheless, I did for them accord-  LESSON DEPARTMENT ing to that which was in my power\" (II Nephi 5:15-18). But though great were his accomplishments as a leader among his people, probably the most significant thing to be remembered about this good man is his delight in the word of God, a delight which carried him actively into the accomplishment of great and significant things for mankind. He knew the value of searching the books of the prophets for the words of eternal life, having been close to these writings through the making of plates upon which the record of his people was engraved. '... For my soul delighteth,\" he says, \"in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and profit of my children. Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard\" (II Nephi 4:15-16). According to Nephi's own account, he had made two sets of plates paralleling the same period of history for his people. 'The first set, more secular in nature, dealt largely with the wars and contentions and destructions of his people. 'The second set, written by express commandment of the Lord, includes the writings of Nephi found in the Book of Mormon as we know it today. Nephi has this to say for the smaller or second set of plates: \"And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my fa- 649 ther; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them. And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates. And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord\" (I Nephi 19:1-3). There is power in the direct and simple words of Nephi which comes from his knowledge of the truth. This prophet saw in vision the birth, death, and resurrection of the Christ hundreds of years before these events were to occur upon the earth, and his understanding of the marvelous gift of God in sending His Son is described in the language of the heart. If one wonders at the magnitude of Christ's atonement as it is written in the Bible, then let him tread Nephi's account of the mission of the Messiah. Herein is a most satisfying experience. Nephi's words concerning the coming of the Savior have, for one seeking the truth, that quiet persuasive power that is not unlike that given through the voice of a friend. Questions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the passage given to discover plain and precious truths of the Gospel brought to light in the Book of Mormon. If time permits, have each member of the class add a passage of his own from within that part of the Book of \\ Mormon (II Nephi, chapters 5 to 33) that gives Nephi's words concerning Christ to his peoplea passage that has brought new meaning to a Gospel truth. 1. Why is it hard to understand many of the great prophecies concerning the mission of Christ found in the Bible? Read II Nephi, chapter 25. The next question may be used if needed for class activity, or it may be assigned for home study: 2. In what condition will be the churches of the world in the latter days? How will new scripture be received? Read II Nephi, chapters 28, 29. L. D. S. Girls and Women in Wartime (Continued from page 606) The modern slogan that women are entitled to equal nghts and opportunities with men has led some women into fallacies of thought and practice that are very damaging 'to them and to the future welfare of mankind. In the first place, as to moral standards, equality of nghts and practices should mean that men should live up to the standards they expect of high-class women. To assume that women may indulge in the same practices that some men indulge in means that woman is simply degrading herself. From another point of view equality of rights does not mean absence of differences and duties any more than does the phrase, \"all men are created free and equal.\" The facts are, of course, that in many respects they are unequal. So in many ways men and women are different and unequal. Each sex may be superior in some respects and inferior in other respects. The difference in biological structure and functions is self-evident. The differences psychologically and socially are not so visibly manifest but are nevertheless a fact. Men and women are complements of each other. The more fully and frankly this is recognized and the life of the family and of society organized and operated on this principle, the greater will be the success and the lasting happiness of both men and women. While it may not be the destiny of every woman to become a wife and mother, to live worthy of motherhood in the highest and most sacred meaning of the term is her proper destiny and road to enduring happiness. Women who have no children of their own can generally find opportunities to take a motherly interest in children of relatives, friends, and neighbors, and in this service find at least some of the satisfactions that go with successful motherhood. Any part in the creation or development of successful lives is one of the greatest contributions to religion.  in the Church Section of The Deseret News Teacher training lessons News from all stakes of the church Full page illustrated children's section Official church welfare news m, Since 1865  Many New Features!

VOL 30, No.1 MAGAZINE NOVEMBER 1943 President Heber J. Grant Reaches Another Milestone President Amy Brown Lyman HE General Board of Relief Society, in behalf of the 115,000 members of the organization, extends greetings and good wishes to our beloved and revered president, Heber J. Grant, on his 87th birthday, on November 22. We love and honor President Grant not only for his many accomplishments and successful life and for his great service to his Church and to humanity in general, but we love and honor him also for the excellence of his personal character, for his faith in God and for his devotion _ to the Gospel of the Master, for his wise and forceful teachings and for his splendid example. Here is a man who practices what he preaches and preaches what he practices. One of the distinguishing characteristics of his personal life which especially appeals to women and which we desire especially to mention, has been his devotion to his mother during her lifetime and to her memory since her passing. He has been PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT outstanding in this respect in an age when ingratitude of children to parents is sometimes encountered. Page 653 654 The only child of his mother and left fatherless when but nine days old, little Heber Grant early manifested a devotion to her which is rare in young children and which is sometimes absent in grownup children. This appreciation of his mother and her ability, and the understanding of her problems and her responsibilities and of her confidence in him, encouraged him in his determination, even when young, to try to take the place of his father in looking after and providing for her. He always remembers with pride her refusal to have the bishop of the ward reshingle her house for her. She was able by the work of her own hand, she said, to have the leaks in the roof patched up, which repair work would last until her own son could build a new house for her.. HIS appreciation and understanding of her motherly virtues has no doubt also influenced his attitude toward the women of his own family and the women of the Church and their work, which has always been one of appreciation and chivalry. Indeed he has ever been a champion in the interest of mothers and of women in general. For the beautiful life they lived together, this widow and son, President Grant gives all praise to his mother. His tributes to her are convincing, beautiful, and touching. But whatever his training, this loved son was by nature kind, tender, and obedient, and he was blessed of the Lord with those qualities which have made him the great and good man that he is. Two people rarely live a life together so full of mutual harmony, respect, and pure love for each other as did that pioneer widow, that devoted Latter-day Saint, Rachel Ridgway Grant, and her pure-hearted, unselfish, charitable, and now distinguished son, President Heber J. Grant. She loved him with the greatest devotion and admiration. But her love and devotion to him did not exceed in the slightest degree his devotion, admiration, and love for her. Eloquent as President Grant is when preaching the Gospel that he loves as much as he loves his own life, yet he is not more eloquent then, nor when speaking upon any other subject, than when referring to the goodness, the gentleness, the faith, devotion, and self-sacrifice for the Gospel of his good and saintly mother. Hers was truly an angelic nature. But great and good as was her nature, it did not exceed the goodness, the kindness, the tenderness, the charity, the efficiency, and the understanding of her distinguished son. FOLLOWING are some very lnteresting excerpts from letters to President Grant written by his mother while he was in Japan and Europe: October 12, 1901 I am much happier that you are where you are and where the Lord wishes you to be that in going in debt and trying to get rich. My motto is, \"Seek first the Kingdom of God, and all things will be added that will be for our good. I fully appreciate the love and gratitude you feel in regard to my teaching I gave you. I often live my life over in thinking how happy I was when we used to sit and sing and talk and measure tape. There would not be so many bad boys and girls if mothers would think more and teach their children the Gospel than thinking so much about their dress. I love to see children look nice and make home pleasant. I always enjoyed your bringing the boys home more than having you go away. October 19, 1901 I am pleased you are studying the scriptures. I used to talk to you and wish you to read them and get ready for a mission. I feel the experience you have had will do you good and you will find more joy and comfort in laboring to bring people to a knowledge of the true and living God than all of the riches this world could afford. _ November 17, 1904 Well, my dear boy, you will soon be forty years of age. You used to say that you thought you would not live to be older than your father was. I am truly thankful you have lived so long and wish you very many years yet and filled with usefulness. I feel I have been blessed above many mothers, to have so good a son, and live to see my wishes and prayers granted that you might live to be a faithful worker in the Kingdom of God. I felt the great responsibility resting upon me as you had no father, for the way I brought you up. November 22, 1906 I intended to write you a letter for your birthday to arrive on that day, but the time passes so fast, I thought I would write on the birthday. You have been in my mind and I have been with you in spirit, if not in person. I have been thinking of you all the day and how much we all have to be thankful for as a family and as a people. If we were all as united as we should be and lived our religion, enjoying the spirit of the Gospel the adversary would not have the power he has. I appreciate all the love and your wish to do all you can to make my last days happy. I wish all mothers had as good a son as I have. ALTARS OF LIFE Courtney E. Cottam Each life erects an altar for its soul, And kneels to worship as the spirit needs,; Its psalm a call of triumph or despair, Faith-bom, knowing that God always heeds. In supplication, then, I humbly bow, Asking for faith to meet this hour's doubt, For courage to withstand the torrent's might, Unbended by the raging winds without. Prayer's answer is unveiled within the heart; True courage lies in humble things done right; Each day, then, let us walk our way in faith That God will lead us into glorious light. PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT REACHES ANOTHER MILESTONE 655 The University of the Home Elder Joseph L. Wirthlin Member of the Presiding Bishopric EEPLY carved in solid stone over the portals of one of Washington, D. C.'s _ great buildings, the following deeply significant statement is found: \"The seed of the past is the harvest of the future.\" A short sentence, but pregnant with much food for serious thinking. The seeds being sown today are of a great varietysome good, others pernicious and noxious. All good husbandmen become familiar with the harmful as well as the good seeds, being able thereby to identify them and root them up before a rich and abundant harvest is ruined. Many of the noxious seeds are being sown about us daily and are so prevalent they are becoming very common to us: Seeds of indebtedness of such proportions in national, state, and local governments by which the shackles of bondage will be securely clasped on unborn generations the moment mortality becomes their heritage. Seeds which promulgate the false and insidious doctrine that Jesus Christ was not the Only Begotten in the flesh and the Savior of mankind but may have been a great teacher or prophet, which doctrine has led the races of man away from the true and lasting plan of peace and into the shambles of battle. Seeds which enslave the body to the use of powerful destructive drugs, namely nicotine and alcohol (A drugged nation has but one destinydecay and oblivion). Page 656 Seeds of disrespect for Constitutional Government, which lead to dictatorship and loss of representative government. Seeds of the corrupt philosophy that men have a right to expect a living from the world without any mental or physical effort upon their part, producing a generation of parasites, willing and anxious to devour the bread of the worker. These seeds largely. Determine what the future harvest will be and the question arises, who will reap the harvest and where are these reapers? The reapers of tomorrow's harvest are in your home and mine. They are the boys and the girls of today. And now another word appearsthe word home. What is its meaning? Webster defines it as a dwelling place, the house in which one lives with his family. The home is all of this and more. It is the first unit of government and church organization. It is the greatest institution of learning in the world. So aptly said by George Herbert, \"The first university is the University of the Home. Here the hours of recitation are the morning, the noon, and the night. Here we find the round table of infancy and parenthood. Here are discussed the problems of the present and the possibilities of the coming years. Here sit the scholars of youth and maidenhood. Here are enthroned two great chairs endowed by destiny and sustained by human affection, fatherhood and motherhood. The greatest university in the UNIVERSITY OF THE HOME world is the home.\" Over the portals of every university of the home, the words of the ancient writer of Proverbs might well be inscribed: \"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\" The home is a great place of preparation for the men and women of tomorrow, the future reapers of a harvest of complexities, problems and issues which will demand the highest in morals, character, mentality, and physical strength. The head of this institution in every real Latter-day Saint home is a servant of God, holding the Melchizedek Priesthood, which entitles him to receive from on high divine direction for the good and benefit of those who reside within his household. The faculty of the University of the Home is comprised of two individualsfather, the head, and mother. Students enrolling will be sent from on high, entrusted by their Heavenly Parents for their education and training in mortality to this faculty. The responsibility thus placed upon the faculty of the University of the Home is most sacred, as the Heavenly Parents of these students desire that they will be so educated and trained that some day they may again return to their heavenly home. HE faculty of the University of the Home should provide a curriculum comprised of those courses which will achieve the finest and highest in. The training of the heart, the head, and the hands of these students., In training the heart, it is to be fully understood that this most important organ first vitalizes the body, 657 keeps it alive. It is the seat of all emotions and the greatest emotion to be cultivated and stimulated is that of love. The first and great - commandment is to love God, the Eternal Father, with all of one's heart and soul and mind; and. The second one is likened unto it, to love one's neighbor as one's self. The first lesson in the training of the heart is in the form of an introduction to the Lord through the channel of prayer. All students of the University of the Home, regardless of age, should surround the family altar of prayer both morning and night, thus teaching them the necessity of constant communication with God, their Eternal Father, which communication and supplication will inculcate into their hearts faith in, respect for, and love for the Lord and His Son Jesus Christ. With the gift of faith. Bestowed from on high comes a desire to obey the commandments of God, and over the years of childhood and adolescence there comes understanding of the Lord's purposes. From a composite of faith, obedience, and understanding comes the greatest of the Lord's blessings, namely, a testimony or divine revelation through ithe power and the gift of the Holy Ghost that God lives, that His Son Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph Smith was an instrument in the hands of God whereby the Gospel was restored and the Church again established upon the earth. Love for one's neighbor is a lesson of paramount importance. Love is a great motivating, stimulating passion, which creates a desire to render service, and this lesson can 658 best be exemplified in rendering service in the home, first on the part of each family member, one to another, and second to one's neighbors, which service is best exemplified through the medium of the Church in the fast offering and tithing principles, in the Welfare Program, and in preaching the Gospel to the nations of the earth. Another great and important love is that for country, its fundamental law the Constitution, and all of its fine traditions. The faculty of the University of the Home will be most remiss in its teaching if it fails to call students to a consideration of the Constitution of the United States. Students should come to know and fully realize that the Constitution made possible the establishment of a great republican form of Government, under whose protection the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ could be restored again upon the earth, that according to the word of the Lord-to His prophet, He suffered it, the Constitution, to be established and to be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 101:77), and that the Lord's prophets from the day of Joseph Smith until the present time have looked upon it as a divine document, so divine that it is literally a part of the religion of every devout and faithful Latter-day Saint. Students should be impressed with the necessity of guarding this sacred document to the end that rather than give up any of its guarantees for freedom of worship, freedom of speech, the right to own property, and rather than remove from it those elements which have built up our great nation on the principle of personal initiative and free enterprise, they should defend it to the last drop of blood. It should be made clear to them that this great land is a choice land above all other lands and is not to be plagued by a king or a dictator, that under the Constitution of the United States more benefits have been created for more people than in any other nation in all the world. In the matter of training the mind, the University of the Home has a definite obligation, while it is generally recognized the training of the mind is highly technical and is generally left to other institutions of learning. Students of the home should be taught to distinguish between that which is true and false, between the insidious doctrine of man and the doctrine of the Lord the doctrine of man having as its objective the disruption of faith in God and His purposes. Students in the University of the Home entering other institutions should have so ingrained in their hearts and minds an understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that the doctrines and teachings of men will be as chaff. In other words, students of the University of the Home should understand as the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, \"The glory of God is intelligence\"; and the glory of God is intelligence when pure knowledge is used in righteous endeavor and in building up the Kingdom of God.- The curriculum of the University of the Home should provide an intense training of the hands. This training begins in childhood. First, the child should be taught to remember that his clothing, his food, his UNIVERSITY OF THE HOME home, and all of his materialistic blessings are the result of someone else's labor. 'Therefore, he should appreciate what it costs in labor to secure the necessities of life. Boys and girls should be given simple tasks to perform in and about the home, teaching them the great fundamental of efficiency. Efficiency is the most important fundamental to success in any endeavor. Girls should be taught all of those tasks which will go to make them efficient, capable home managers. Boys who reside on farms should be taught in the matters of plowing, irrigation, feeding, and handling of livestock and to do these so efficiently that the best results may be realized. With this fundamental training given in the home, efficiency will become a very part of the lives of these men and women of tomorrow and their efforts will be crowned with success. Students of the University of the Home should be taught that the darkest hour in any man or woman's life is when he sits down to plan to get something without working for it. Brigham Young's axiom on indolence indicates that laziness travels slowly and is soon overtaken by poverty. Moreover, each child should be taught to sustain himself rather than anticipate sustenance from any governmental agency, for after all the Government is a perpetual consumer, a consumer of the people's taxes; and because of the fact that the people sustain the Government out of their resources, in no instance should the Government support the people. Whenever a child or an individual thinks he can be dependent upon society, then he becomes an enemy of society. 659 The University of the Home library should be supplied with the finest of books. First the books ot the Lord: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price should be available, in addition to many more volumes written by inspired men. Surveys indicate that youth reads innumerable trashy periodicals dealing with crime and sex problems. The reading of such material can be obviated by home guidance in the proper selection of reading material. The brain is a vast storehouse of thoughts and knowledge. Thought and knowledge become the parents of deeds, either for good or evilfirst the thought and then the deed. Thoughts are but deeds in the embryo. Student-body activities in the University of the Home should be so broad as to include all activity which should give expression to the highest ideals, whether in the dance, games, athletics, drama, music, etc. After all, the recreational activities in the University of the Home should be the measure, the index by which the world will judge Latter-day Saint homes. Recreation and pleasure satisfy the desires of the heart. The kind of music listened to, the books that are read, the dramas that are enjoyed, the people associated with these are the best index to ideals and culture. The faculty of the University of the Home should impressively teach God's law of health by setting the proper example, abstaining from those things which are not good for the body. A coffee-pot or a teapot on the back of the stove is an invitation to any young man or any young 660 woman to partake of intoxicating beverages or tobacco. Students of the University of the Home should be taught that the first requisites for success are a strong, clean mind and body. More than that, the Lord's spirit will tabernacle itself in clean bodies, revealing, as the Lord promised, great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures. 'The senior year of the University of the Home should be given over largely to the greatest lesson, namely, the lesson of life, the effectiveness of its teaching being evidenced by obeying the first great commandment of multiplying and replenishing the earth. Young men and young women ought to be taught that life has but two purposes: first, a manifestation of love for God and rendering obedience to His commandments; and second, through such obedience affording an opportunity to many of the unborn spirits the privilege of coming into this school of mortality and taking upon themselves bodies of flesh and bone. The lesson of life should be taught so clearly that students will fully comprehend that the achievement of the objectives of life are wholly contingent upon chasteness and lives that are wholly compatible with the Gospel, which should entitle any young man or woman to make claim on the bishop for a temple recommend to the Lord's house for the purpose of being united for time and eternity with one's life mate as a reward for a clean obedient life. These lessons properly taught in the University of the Home will eliminate many embarrassing situations when young men and young women appear before the bishop requesting the privilege of going into the Lord's house, and are placed upon probation for a period because of a lack of knowledge of the requirements and not living the proper kind of a life. HE inevitable day of graduation will come and the theme of the commencement exercises should be that which is found in the words of Jehovah to Joshua when Joshua stood on the heights of the promised land with the hordes of the children of Israel at his back. 'Then the voice of Jehovah said, \"Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest\" (Joshua.1:9). Graduates of the University of the Home will stand upon the heights of their promised land and they, too, should be strong and of good courage, know no fear, nor should they be dismayed, for God their Heavenly Father will be with them insofar as they live the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Moreover He will qualify them to reap the uncertain harvest of the future. Their destiny is one of leadership and the Lord will qualify them for that leadership. One more word of advice to graduates, try to understand fully the fifth commandment given to Moses on Sinai, \"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" Honor them during their declining years, never forget that father and mother who nurtured you in your childhood, fully sustaining you throughout young manhood and young woman hood, and that God will hold to (Continued on page 694) They Were Called Pilgrims Vesta Crawford O many of us Thanksgiving means a feast, a time of rejoicing for the fruits of the land. This year, particularly, Thanksgiving should mean a spiritual feast as well, a reckoning with that \"plenty\" which is not dependent upon the harvesting of fields. We have thought of the first Thanksgiving as the celebration in 1621 when the Pilgrims prepared a feast in the wilderness. That day was associated with reaping, the gathering of crops, the storage of food for winter. It was a day of appreciation for the good things of the earth. Yet there was a deeper meaning, a memory of a previous year when there was no material thing to harvest. The very first Thanksgiving Day was not a festival it was not an autumn holiday. In December, 1620, when the Pilgrims first set foot on the shore of the New World, deep winter lay upon the land and the forest looked dark and foreboding. There was a storm at sea and a strong wind shook the stubble of Indian corn that leaned up against the hills. We might try to voice the thoughts and feelings of these wanderers who faced the winter in an alien land. The words of the English poet, Felicia Hemans, have caught the spirit of that time and place and have given us a picture that can never be forgotten: The breaking waves dashed high On a stern and rock-bound coast And the woods against a stony sky Their giant branches tossed.. And the heavy night hung dark The hills and water o'er When a band of exiles moored their bark On the wild New England shore.... The pioneer, the pilgrim; has always been faced with loneliness and hardship. We can realize this because Our direct ancestors, too, made sacrifices for religious freedom and for the opportunity to develop their own social ideals. 'There is a striking parallel that links the story of the Pilgrims with the pioneer history of our own people. There is much more to the word pilgrim than we may have realized. The direct source of the name comes from the Bible. In that Epistle wherein Paul, the Apostle, speaks to the Hebrews, it is written in the eleventh chapter: \"By faith he (Abraham) sojourned in the land of promise, as in a. Strange country.... For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Through faith also Sara herself received strength.... These all died in faith... And confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth... They desire a better country.\" The New England Pilgrims, also, followed the pattern explained in the Bible, for \"They sojourned in the land of promise.\" They set about to build homes in the wilderness \"westward.\" There, on the edge of an unknown land, they were thankful for simple things, for the Page 661 662 earth and the streams of water, for the trees and for the light of the evening fires. \"THERE is a true and graphic account of this first Thanksgiving Day written by a man who was there, Governor William Bradford. Even in the midst of the exacting demands of pioneer life, the great governor could not forget his heritage and the heritage of his people. He remembered the departure from Leyden in. The land of Holland: \"So they left ye goodly and pleasante citie, which had been their resting place for near twelve years, but they knew that they were Pilgrims and looked not much ons those things but lifted up their eyes to ye heavens their dearest countrie and quieted their spirits.\" The long journey across the stormy Atlantic was a brave pilgrimage to a land the wanderers had never seen. Today when distance is a small thing, we cannot fully. Appreciate the loneliness of that one small ship adrift so far from home. It is difficult, even, for us to realize the loneliness of a covered wagon on the western prairies. Perhaps we have gone too far away from a time when thankfulness was an everyday rejoicing of the spirit. Governor Bradford called the Mayflower \"ye dauntless ship,\" and he writes in detail of the arrival in the dark days of early winter. He voices relief that the sea was conquered and an abiding place had been found at last: \"Being thus artived in good harbor and brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed ye God of heaven, who had brought them over ye vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all ye perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on ye firm and stable earth, their proper elemente.\" The Pilgrims, like all pioneers, could not forget what they had left behind. The brightness and the hope of the future were not strong enough to dull the memory of home. Even on their first Thanksgiving Day, they remembered Southampton where the Mayflower came to gather up the Holland Pilgrims; they remembered Plymouth, in England, where they had looked their last upon their native land. Realizing this, Bradford expressed the solitude they felt in that small strip of land between the forest and the sea: \"They had no friends to wellcome them, nor inns to entertain or refresh their weatherbeaten bodies, nor houses or much less towns to repair to, to seek for succoure.\" There was ice on the streams. There was no green plant nor red flower, no blade of grass nor grain. The earth was an etching of gray and brown tree trunks and white hill slopes. \"And for ye season it was winter, and ye know ye winters of ye countrie, know them to be sharp and violent, and subject to cruelle and fierce storms, dangerous to travel to known places, and more to search an unknown coast. Besides what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full of willd beasts and willd men, and what multitudes there might be of them they knew not.... For summer being done all things stand upon them with a weatherbeaten face, and ye whole countrie, full of woods and thickets, represented a willd and savage hiew.\" THEY WERE CALLED PILGRIMS GUCH was the New England shore on that day when the cornerstone of a nation was laid in the strength of religious freedom. There was much to be thankful for, an appreciation and a memory that should extend to us every day and every year. Governor Bradford earnestly expresses a universal thought: \"Our fathers came over this great ocean, and were ready to perish in the wilderness; but they cried unto ye Lord, and he heard their voice.... Let them therefore praise ye Lord because he is good-and his mercies endure forever.\" It is recorded that on the first 663 Thanksgiving Day there was singing. Again, the words of Felicia Hemans tell in rhythmic measures the story that Bradford wrote in simple prose:  Amidst the storm they sang And the stars heard, and the sea, And the sounding aisles of: the dim woods rang To the anthem of the free.... Is there not a parallel in this with the singing of the western pioneers of a later day? With their wagons circled around them, they, too, sang their pilgrim songs in the wilderness: Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear.... AUTUMN SUNSET Grace Zenor Pratt From the steep summit of the winding roadway I look again at Juarez far below, Serenely guarded by her sheltering mountains Gilded and glorified by sunset's mellow glow; The red, the gold, the flame of scarlet maples.... Autumn has glorified the fertile valley there Green distant fields and there a singing streamlet, While peace lies over all like solemn prayer. The brooding hills are mauve and blue like sapphire, That ring about the valley's jeweled worth; I sometimes feel when looking down on Juarez There is no lovelier place on all this earth. Moral and Religious Integrity Elder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union rity, these Jesus called the weightier matters of the law. They are fundamental virtues in both civic and religious life. The Latter-day Saints in pioneer days acquired wide reputation for business integrity. To be identified with the Church was better security than stocks and bonds. Some current bankers' codes of ethics state that a borrower's character is more important than his collateral security. Probably most business men would agree to this in principle, if not in practice. We may well ask ourselves, is membership in the Church now a guarantee of business integrity? Unfortunately, it is not always so; even court records reveal some damaging evidence. The craze to get rich quick and by easy rather than by earned methods is largely responsible for this slump from industry and honesty. The desire to excel in making a show of luxury and fashion is also an important cause of dishonest practices leading to misappropriation of institutional and public funds or to inexcusable bankruptcy. \"Plain living and high thinking\" supported by industry, physical or mental or both, is the most certain method of forestalling these departures from the standard of integrity properly expected of all Latter-day Saints. This, however, is only one phase of integrity. Other phases are of no Page 664 less importance. Integrity applies also to fulfillment of all one's moral and religious obligations, living up to one's professions. A Latter-day Saint presumably has accepted the Restored Gospel with all its standards of individual and social living. There are those who pride themselves on strict conformity to outward observance of some of these standards, involving practices that may be seen of men, or shown on the Church records, and assume by this that they are thorough Latter-day Saints. How do they stand on the first and second great commandments? 'They may think they stand very well on the first, but what conception have they of the spiritual qualities of God? Do they give any thought to this question? If so, is He conceived in terms of their own human weaknesses, as do many primitive peoples, or do they attribute to Him the highest virtues of which man can conceive and much beyond? Does their professed love of God include love of these virtues, and sincere effort to realize them in their own lives? \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" Unless love of God results in striving to realize this ideal, it is but a pretense and a very wide departure from the principle of integrity. As professed religion it is in the same class as that manifested by some of the scribes and Pharisees so severely denounced by Jesus as hypocrites MORAL AND RELIGIOUS INTEGRITY and worse than ordinary sinners. The sin of hypocrisy is the antithesis of religion. Without sincerity profession of religion is a mockery, and worse than making no profession of religion at all. What of the second great commandment? Do the Pharisees of our time really love their fellowmen as they love themselves, or do they seek first and foremost their own advantage with little concern for the welfare of their fellows? When confronted with the suffering of fellowmen do they seek in all sincerity and diligence to relieve this suffering, or do they wrap about them their cloak of assumed righteousness and \"pass by on the other side\" as did the priest and the Levite in the story of the good Samaritan? In the history of religions it often happens that the initial enthusiasm under the leadership of a great proph- 665 et tends to slump, and the adherents of a religion forget the great ideals and purposes of their religion. 'They either ignore these ideals and set about enriching themselves and impoverishing other people, as did some of the rulers of ancient Israel and Judah, or they do as did the scribes and Pharisees, concentrate on outward observance of some of the details of the law, confusing means with ends, replacing spiritual attitudes and motives with mere outward conformity, and forgetting altogether the greater commandments upon which all others are founded. Jesus said \"... Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees...\" We may well say to ourselves, \"Beware lest we seek to rise by this same kind of leaven.\" There is danger that it may leaven the whole lump. Let us maintain our religious integrity. _RADIO SERIES Commencing Sunday, October 10, Elder Aloert E.

Pioneer Life in Old Mexico Florence Ivins Hyde IONEER life in Old Mexico is one of the unique stories of Mormon historythe story of a small group, loyal to their family ties, fleeing from persecution to a place of refuge. \"Refugees,\" they were called. It is not the usual story of pioneers trekking across great distances of desert land with the fear of death from Indians added to their other hardships, but rather one of making new homes in a strange land. The story of the Mormon colonies in Mexico is the story of the building of communities under difficult circumstances. The life of our family was typical of life in the colonies. I recall countless pleasures of those early daysI still feel the joy of long, hot afternoons spent by us children sitting on the limbs of trees eating juicy peaches, or under a_ grapevine quenching our thirst with the watery grapes; watching the birds carry sticks and strings to build their nests, or industrious ants carry tiny bits of food down into a hole in the ground for a winter store. I recall, too, the fun of eating parched corn, strips of dried venison which my father sizzled over the coals; and the unique experience of learning how to catch fleas so that we might be able to sleep. All these childhood experiences were more interesting than the winters spent in school (at that time none too good), trying to learn Spanish. They were pleasures which we enjoyed as a matter of course, with Page 666 out understanding the sacrifices made by the original settlers to make even these few things possible. What to our parents was a tremendous sactifice, was to us children only a new adventure. Years before our immediate family was called as missionaries into Mexico, my grandfather, Erastus Snow, had been sent down from Utah to purchase land for the settlement of colonies by members of the Church. Soon after, in 1885, the first \"refugees,\" seventy in number, had crossed over the border from Snowflake, Arizona. These early pioneers suffered many of the hardships that accompany pioneer life. What they ate, they had to raise, and what they wore, they had to make. At first, they lived in tents, but as soon as possible they began to build permanent homes. In 1888, Erastus Snow had built for himself a two-story adobe house in Colonia Juarez at a cost of $1,400, \"to encourage others to build good houses.\" It is certain that the adults in these colonies would have preferred to have remained in their homes in the United States. Many of them had already pioneered in southern Utah and Arizona; but rather than give up their family ties they undertook this strange new life. TWELVE years after the first group went into Mexico, my father was called to preside over the Mexican Mission and to organize the Mexican Agricultural and Colonization PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO Company. He had already filled two missions to the interior of Mexico; but this time he was not to spend two years there, but he was told to take his family and prepare to make his home in Mexico. The sacrifice such a move entailed cannot be understood by one who has not experienced it. His future in the United States seemed to hold the. Greatest success for him. After receiving the call from the Presidency of the Church, he rode out to his ranch on the Kaibab mountain to talk it out, as was always his custom, with himself and his horse. The greatest sacrifice was not for himself but for his wife and children. To move them away from a state that offered them the advantages of education and culture, from their families and friends, to a land which had nothing to, offer, required the greatest of courage. His diary tells of men who advised \"I wouldn't go,\" but he and his wife decided there was nothing else for them to do. The family was to travel by train to the border but all of our \"belongings\" had to be taken overland. My father took over the border two mules and sixty horses (among which were two thoroughbred mares, Pearl Livingstone and Minnehaha), and old Jimmy, a horse which had grown up with our family and was now too old to be of any service, but. Also too old to be left behind. A little later he brought over a setting of white Wyandotte eggs, the first hatching to come to the colony. Our first impression of our new home came as we awoke in the morning in a hotel at the border and heard the clatter of horses' hoofs on the cobblestone street, the rattle of ROAD INTO THE MOUNTAIN COLONIES the milk wagons as they passed by, and the call of the Mexican boys, \"Aqui viene la leche!\" (\"Here comes the milk.\"). Here, at the border, we met the wagons which had come overland in which we were to make the remainder of the journey. That short trip of about 100 miles over the desert into Colonia Juarez can never be forgotten. We cooked our meals over a campfire and ate them sitting on blankets on the ground or on the wagon seats. At night our parents made beds on the ground under the stars, where we were lulled to sleep by the tinkle of the cowbells as the - animals hobbled around to find feed. We were to experience many such nights during our life in Mexico, nights spent in the tops of the mountains where we heard the cry of a lone wolf, or in the narrow box canyons where the call of the hoot owl 668 echoed up and down the walls. Mexican skies are filled with twinkling stars and a moon which seems to shine brighter than in any other place in the world, and which gives one a feeling for the beauty that led the psalmist to sing, \"When I... Meditate on thee in the night watches.\" Colonia Juarez, which was to be our home, was situated in a picturesque spot in the bend of the Piedres Verdes River. Here we occupied the house built years before by Grandfather Snow. By adding three rooms and a lean-to it made a comfortable home for our family of eleven until we built our new home, supplied with running water, a built-in sink, and other conveniences which seemed to us like the acme of luxuly. Seldom a week passed without our entertaining \"company\" of some sort. We boarded the school teacher from the North; we entertained Mexican officials who came on business; we \"kept\" the Church officials who came for conferences. All of these visitors made it necessary for us children to be continuously on our best behavior. During those years our parents had to become accustomed to depending upon themselves. They nursed us through epidemics of measles and other childhood diseases without a doctor and with no medicine except home remedies. Many times it was necessary for mother to be left alone. With a sick child, but before leaving, father always put his hands upon the sick child's head and prayed for him. The members of the colonies also helped one another. If one mother had not enough food for her nursing baby, some other mother was found who would nurse the child and save its life. But occasionally, tragedies came, just as they are bound to come in any community. My father writes in his diary of a day when the corpses of two children and one man lay in the little town at the same time. All had died of what they called pneumonia. Up to the time we went to Juarez, there had never been a doctor in any of the colonies. A midwife delivered the babies with the usual degree of success. In case of accidents and diseases, the people had to depend on themselves. It is a miracle that so many recovered; but as is always. True when people are left to themselves, there were more prayers offered, and more administrations to the sick. All sorts of home remedies were used also, some of which probably did no good, but no harm either. In the spring, children were fed molasses and sulphur, with no knowledge of the valuable vitamin in molasses. For some troubles plasters of cooked onions were applied alternating with plasters of freshly killed chicken flesh. Many deaths, however, must have occurred due to lack of medical care and _ professional nursing. At one time the town suffered from an epidemic of typhoid fever. My father made the trip to El Paso, Texas, to consult a physician. Following his instructions, my sister and I, for the twelve weeks we were sick, tasted nothing but boiled milk and an antiseptic called 'acetezone,\" which we drank by the gallon. Our parents acted as our nurses, mother during the day and father at night. Once when my mother was suffering PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO 669 THE IVINS HOME IN COLONIA JUAREZ from lumbago, our neighbor came each day and bathed us. Later when the daughter-in-law of this same neighbor was stricken with typhoid, a child was born to her prematurely. 'There was no such thing as an incubator, but the child was saved by being wrapped in cotton and being fed with a spoon. Each day during this time of sickness, my mother carried to this neighbor two quarts of boiled milk. It was experiences such as these which cemented the people together in the strongest bonds of friendship. We were necessary to each other and no matter what our difficulties, something always brought us through. LL sorts of problems present themselves in a new community titles to lands, taxes, duties on imports, and social problems such as schools and entertainments. Trips had to be made to Chihuahua to request the governor not to collect taxes from colonists who had not resided there ten years, and to have reduced other taxes which were unequally assessed and very burdensome. Water rights had to be settled; lands surveyed; arrangements had to be made in the different colonies for payment of pasturage by those who had no range land but had cattle grazing on colony land all practical but difficult problems to adjust. Later, land had to be sought out for the establishment of other colonies, eight in all. There were six colonies settled in Chihuahua: Diaz, Dublan, and Juarez, with three located in the mountains, Chuichupa, Pacheco, and Garcia; and two colonies in Sonora: Oaxaca and Morelos. Large amounts of land ex- PARTY OF GOVERNOR AHUMADA AT HOME OF PRESIDENT IVINS Front row left to right: Member of Governor's party, Henry Eyring, Governor Ahumanda, President Ivins, the Jefe Politico of Casas Grandes.

Isted but very little water. The settling of all these problems required the men to be away from home and to travel in what we called a \"buckboard,\" a vehicle none too comfortable. Most of these trips my father made alone. In his diary he speaks of one trip through \"country wild and broken, sparsely settled, where the people look like a lot of rogues.\" Once as he camped at night, finding himself without matches, he put cotton from a camp quilt into his gun and fired it to start his campfire. According to my mother's record, father was at home only six months of the first two years in Mexico! We were always controlled by the jefe politico at Casas Grandes, about five miles away. For some reason eo we were never permitted to establish a municipality at Juarez, which resulted in all civic problems being decided by the Priesthood. Before long it was decided to assess the people to build an irrigation canal. Men were hired to do the work at twentyfive cents per hour or fifty cents foi a man with a team. Most families depended upon the well water foi household purposes. Practically every family had its own garden and milked its own cows. A flour mill was built to grind the farmers' wheat, a molasses mill to take the syrup from the cane. We had two \"yeast women\" who would exchange homemade yeast for a cup of flour or half-a-cup of sugar. As a rule, however, each household was independent in itself. 670 \" PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO In the early days, the flour was very dark and the bread was heavy. Sugar was unrefined, about the color of our maple sugar, made in \"pelous,\" cone-shaped pieces about two feet high, just the shape of the crown of a Mexican sombrero. One job of us children was to pulverize this sugar by using father's pestle and mortar. Several years later, after my father had succeeded in having the duties reduced, we imported refined sugar and flour from \"the States.\" All the cooking was done on a wood-burning stove, the fires of which were started with chips gathered from the woodpile the night before by us children. Always on the back of the stove simmered a kettle of cracked wheat which made a perfect breakfast served with thick jersey cream and cream biscuits. For dinner, we had an abundance of crisp vegetables from our own garden, our own chickens or any meat that could be obtained at the time. Occasionally someone in the town killed a beef and we stood in line to get what we could. Wild meat could be obtained at any time of the year for there were no game laws, and always at Christmas time we had a wild turkey, if not killed by ourselves, then purchased from Mr. Stegal. I have no childhood recollection of tender, juicy beefsteaks, but plenty of tender venison. For supper at night, we had bread and milk, sometimes cornmeal mush, with plenty of fruit, molasses, and cheese. On our table was always a large pitcher of blue \"separated\" milk and a pitcher of thick yellow cream. We mixed our own milk according to the richness we desired. I long for those suppers again! 671 We made our own butter, more than we ate, and while it was plentiful mother \"put it down\" in fivegallon cans for the winter, when it was scarce. Butter to be \"put down\" must be worked over and over with a wooden ladle to separate all the milk, which would sour, from the fat, then stored in a cool under- - ground cellar. So far as I know, no fruit was ever preserved in glass jars, for in our town was a man who made tin cans. Our fresh fruit was preserved in quart cans and our preserves in five-gallon cans. These tin cans were made with a groove around the edge inside of which fitted a lid. To seal the can, melted resin was poured into the groove. When the can was opened, the resin, which was bitter, had to be chipped out with great care for if it got into the can the fruit would be bitter. We made our own candy from molasses and honey. After supper in the winter, we all sat together around the fireplace while father read to us stories of adventure of Stanley in Africa, of a carrier pigeon in the Spanish-American war, or else, together we worked puzzles and riddles from the Ladies' Home Journal. We had to supply our own entertaimment. Adult groups presented Othello, East Lynn, the opera Queen Esther, and other pretentious plays. I remember well the terror that gripped our young hearts as Othello plunged the dagger into the heart of the beautiful Desdemona; and we were touched emotionally when Oucen Esther sang with resignation, \"T will go unto the king, and if I perish, I perish.\" Our daytime entertainment was of a most wholesome typehorseback riding, basketball, baseball, croquet, gathering wild walnuts, or hunting or fishing in the mountains where deer, turkeys, and other wild animals abounded. Once while driving through the mountains we saw a fox running away with a turkey, and on another occasion we drove through a forest with a fire burning on each side of the road while brightly colored parakeets chattered like monkeys as we passed along. The road into these extremely rough mountains was in places steep and of solid rock, and we always lightened the load for the horses by walking up the dugways. Around Mound Valley could be woven the romance of an ancient city. It is supposed that each of the many mounds covers a ruin. Up one of the mountains is one large cave containing about eighty rooms which once served as a home, as is indicated by its ollas and broken pottery. It was in one of these rooms that we found, one day, on the hard plaster of the wall, the name, \"Erastus Snow,\" in grandfather's own handwriting. Near here, too, where my father prospected for ore were found, he says in his diary, \"sixteen rich veins of copper-bearing quartz, not feasible to mine because the country is almost inaccessible, even on horseback.\" Not far away is located what he named the \"Seven Star Mine,\" \"'tich in silver ore, and caves of beautiful stalagmites and stalactites.\" All through these mountains are most beautiful flowers and ferns and in some places dellicious mountain trout. On these trips, we children, as we grew to manhood and womanhood, learned some of the most valuable lessons of our lives: a love of nature, an appreciation of the great outdoors, a knowledge of the bigness of the universe, proper treatment of animals as well as of each other. It was here, when we once saw five deer drinking in the stream near us, that father, himself a great hunter, said, \"I could never shoot a deer if I could see its eyes.\" At another time when a guest we had taken with us began, on Sunday morning, to prepare his fishing tackle to go down to the stream, my father remarked casually, ''My hook never catches anything on Sunday.\" Our brothers spent much of their time in Mexico with their horses, the value of which can hardly be overestimated. Good manners in horses are just as important as good manners in men; both require long and constant training. An _ educated horse responds to the slightest move of its rider and struts and shows style according to his command. Nothing is more charming nor gives greater satisfaction than a well-trained horse, and unless it is his dog, a boy cannot have a finer friend. One of the most. Urgent needs of the colonies was a better school. A one-room building with a basement served as schoolhouse, meetinghouse, theater, and dance hall. It was this great need that led the people to assess themselves 8 per cent of their incomes to build the Juarez Stake Academy, which soon became an accredited school, its courses being accepted by colleges of the United States. The construction of better buildings had been made possible by having the duty lifted from such articles as nails and glass.  PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO 673 JUAREZ ACADEMY, COLONIA JUAREZ, CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO From the time the academy was built we had excellent teachers \"from the States,\" who trained numerous local teachers. No one who grew up in the Mexican colonies can ever forget the lasting influence of those two great teachers, Guy C. Wilson and Ella Larsen. Every six months my parents did their marketing in E] Paso, Texas. To us it was the hub of the universe. Hats, shoes, cloth for dresses, and household articles were all purchased to last six months. Our dental work had to be done there also. Around my memories of El Paso always hovers the memory of the unwelcome dentist's chair. Thunder storms and floods are among my most vivid recollections of Mexico. One can never forget the frightening claps of thunder nor the floods that came down the Piedres Verdes River. The rain there literally \"comes down in sheets.\" During the rainy season, which lasts all summer, a shower must be expected every day; but once in a while an unusually large cloud appears. One _ watches it grow larger and larger until it bursts, appearing to fall in one great bucketful. Soon up this river one hears a roaring sound which grows louder and louder until it reaches the town. It comes down the river bed like a great wall, carrying before it uprooted trees, barns, sometimes animals, and always in the old days before we built a permanent bridge, the extension bridge which swung across the river. In those days, if the flood came in the daytime, 'everyone ran to the banks of the river and watched. It meant that\" until the river went down no one from our side could get to the store, WRECKAGE FROM A FLOOD OF THE PIEDRES VERDES RIVER nor to meetings, and the only way we could get messages to those on the other side was to stand on the bank and call through our cupped hands. When the flood came at night, it had for us children a more sinister aspect, as if some great monster were on the rampage, which would leave the shores strewn with wreckage as the water subsided. LL these experiences in a strange country had their price in money, toil, and even the length of life itself. Iam certain our friends and relatives visiting the colonies felt sorry for us, as we sometimes did for ourselves, and saw little to compensate for such a life of exile. Destiny sometimes plays a remarkable part in the lives of people and as the years go by our experiences in Mexico become richer. In spite of the many advantages that we missed in our youth, we have felt the genuine happiness that only the simplicity of the outdoors can bring; we had the great advantage of growing up among people who were basically fine, people who found their great pleasure with friends, riding through the mountains, climbing the hills, and boating down the river in the bright moonlight. The friends we made in that faraway country are the friends of our youth. We can always count on. Them. When they suffer, we suffer and are always ready with sympathy. With them, we saw this small Mormon town grow into a town of good homes, electric lights, telephones, with many other of the modern conveniences. Sometimes we wonder where all the present confusion is leading us. We, as parents, have studied the sciences of psychology and sociology that we feel are so important today, but we still have before us the task of meeting our problems as well as our parents met theirs in early Mormon life. They were \"artists in the art of life,\" which someone has said is, after all, the end of all education.  For Christmas This Year Nellie O. Parker Member of the Relief Society General Board E can bring a freshness of spirit to Christmas this year and a determination to make the best of the situation which the war has imposed upon us. Dearth of material things which we have been accustomed to use for our celebration, will challenge our resourcefulness. 'The metal which made trinkets and toys and baubles has long since gone to war, and restricted production of commodities and utilities, as well as a shortage of some types of food present other problems for us. But as a statesman recently reminded us, \"A crisis can be made a time of opportunity if imagination and ingenuity are called into action.\" First of all we can give the day the full spiritual significance for which it was instituted by Christian people. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, and the Son gave Himself, even His life that the children of earth would know the right pattern of living which would bring them joy and peace in this life and hope for the eternity which follows.\". Christmas is a commemoration of this day when His Son was born and it has been established by long custom on December 25 as the day on which we celebrate Christ's birth. This year we can make it a day of gratitude and thanksgiving to God. We can radiate more love and kindness by being more thoughtful and unselfish and by extending good will not only to our friends but to others, The' especially to the needy and less fortunate. You remember Jesus said, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Jesus gave Himself unstintingly; we can give more of ourselves with our gifts and they will be greatly enriched, as \"The gift without the giver is bare.\" We should try to make our gifts and decorations out of the things we have, rather than try to buy from a market of scarcity and often inferior quality. We should take stock of our resources, salvage and repair decorations of former years. From trunks and closets we may search for material which can be used to make articles which will make very acceptable presents. To mention a few of the things which can be made from used material there are rugsbraided, crocheted, woven, or made of small] pieces of cloth sewed in a design to a burlap or canvas back and outlined with thread. Old sweaters can be unraveled and made over into scarfs, mittens, caps, slippers, or afghans. Felt hats, the brighter the better, can be cut into pieces and appliqued on various things: for book markers; for children's Alpine sets hats, belts, and purses; for corsages, etc. Men's trousers, especially those belonging to boys who have gone into the service, which will be too small for them when they return, can be made into attractive little pleated skirts or jumper dresses for little girls. 'The seams can be hidden under the pleats and when the Page 675 676 articles are cleaned and _ beautifully pressed they will make as fine gifts as any purchased at a store. Good looking little boy suits can also be made. 'The secret lies in copying good patterns, sewing the suits carefully, then pressing them well. Adult coats can be made into smaller coats and some of them are very suitable for snowsuits. The best parts of an old bathrobe can be used in making a child's robe, especially if a little new material is used for collar and cuffs. Sugar sacks make very attractive luncheon sets when bleached and edged with colored rickrack or coarse lace, with a simple motif outlined in a corner to match the edging. Ten-pound sacks make a nice size for a place mat. One end may be decorated with a band of bright material and a motif repeating the same color may be placed on the other end. The smaller five-pound bags can be used for the napkins. These same size bags will make attractive quilt blocks, especially if dainty flowered percale is appliqued on them in some pretty design. Scrapbooks containing good continued magazine stories, collected and pasted neatly together with their illustrations will make welcome gifts for service men in shut-in places, such as on submarines or troop ships, or for convalescents in hospitals, etc. Collections of funny stories and riddles will also spread cheer and entertainment and will afford the maker plenty of opportunity for artistic expression in creating attractive covers for them. For favors, pieces of hard differentcolored candy, nuts, and raisins may be covered with bits of cellophane, twisting the ends to make a stem, and grouped together like a bunch of grapes or like a corsage with lace paper doily for a base. Be sure to make the whole house look festive and cheerful. A large bowl of pyracantha from the garden set before a mirror will give a beautiful red and green picture, or wreaths may be made from evergreen boughs, tied with red ribbon or chintz, and hung over a mirror or on the front door. Put candles at the base of the mirror. Frame a window, mirror, or archway with green and with red paper bells and festoons. A beautiful winter table scene may be made by whitening tumble weed with kalsomine and glitter and arranging it on a mirror with miniature reindeer, china birds, or little houses grouped around in front of it. The story of the first Christmas may be told by pictures cut from magazines and placed on the mantel or wall. Scotch tape will hold the pictures in place without injuring the wall. A display of beautiful Christmas cards of this and former years placed around the living room adds to the spirit of the occasion. If we make the things we do have interesting, striking, and abundant, then no one will miss the things we do not have. In addition, if we give full measure of friendliness, and if we reach out with kindness, then Christmas this year can be one which will in reality reflect the Christmas spirit. There are gifts from our kitchens we can share with othersa carrot pudding, a loaf of Boston brown bread, a cleverly arranged box or plate of cookies, a glass of jelly or a (Continued on page 694) Happy Ending Rosa Lee Lloyd KIRK had always loved Linda's dark hair. Now his hard hand touched it reverently, almost as a small son would smooth a mother's forehead. \"How about it, Belinda?\" he asked, eagerly.. \"All right, Kirk. I can't argue with you anymorenot in that uniform. So if that's the way you want itwe'll have a wedding.\" \"That's the way I want it.\" His brown eyes teased her. \"Never argue with a top sergeant: especially on his first furlough. Remember had to be plenty tough to win these stripes.\" Linda touched them, lovingly. Her eyes held a final plea. \"Please, Kirk, limit the invitations to close friends who are really glad it has turned out this way.' I don't want curious ones who would come to see the old scars\" Her voice stumbled. He knew she was remembering the very thing he was so eager for her to forget. She lifted her eyes, with the faint shadows at the corners, to his tall figure lounging on the arm of her chair. \"After all, Kirk, some people don't think a divorced woman rates a wedding\" He stooped and closed her trembling lips with his own steady ones. His kiss was quick and light. \"Is that so? Well, I think they do. In this case both the groom and the best man think sowhat they think ought to be good enough for the bride. Say!' His eyes flew to his wristwatch. \"He'll be here in an hour. We'll meet him at the train. Boy! I can hardly wait.\" He squeezed into the chair beside her and cradled her slender shoulders in the circle of his arm. \"Greg is the swellest guy in the world. That's one thing I'm set onyou and Greg seeing things eye to eye.\" He traced the smile on her lips with a tanned finger. \"Has Greg seen your uniform?\" she asked. \"Yeah. Last month when I came through Omaharemember? He's anxious to get back into one. Too bad that old shrapnel wound keeps him out of the army.\" Linda closed her eyes. Her head rested against his shoulder. \"Now remember,\" his young voice commanded. \"'He's going to take care of you while I'm in the war. That's why I stopped over in Omahato get that promise.\" \"You like Greg as much as ever?\" \"More than ever. He's tops. There isn't another fellow in the world who could step into my shoes \"?

But I have to go over itfor the last time, Belinda. I won't be satisfied unless I know the way you really feel about everything. I don't want you to marry again if you still feel bitter and disillusioned, if you are doing it just for me.\" There was a breathless silence. Linda's teeth left little white marks in her lower lips. When she spoke, he had to bend his head to hear. \"Kirk, I know you wonder why I have never discussed my divorce with you. That is the way I am, darling. I can't talk freely about the things that hurt me. At first, I thought it was all his fault. Lately I have realized it was mine, too. There were too many parties, too much freedom, and too little respect for marriage. I had to learn that men make easy love to an attractive woman. When you marry very young, you begin to wonder if you have missed a lot of thingsyou listen to flattery. Your husband tries the same thingthen you quarrel. Divorce is the next step and it happensno matter whom it hurts. That is the story, Kirk. All you need to reI got rid of him, too. Member is that I really want to try again.\" Kirk's breath came easier now and the world was in his eyes. His voice was husky. \"\"That's all I ask. Now I can go to war with my feet in the clouds. Dreams do come trueI can hold on to that thought when the going gets tough\" \"Kirk\" Linda held his hands in both of hers. \"I didn't realize how much it meant to you until lately. HonestlyI didn't.\" His eyes narrowed like a man looking against the sun. The pulse in his throat throbbed. \"I haven't thought of anything else since your divorce.\" Silence. Linda winced. \"I know now how you've felt all along, Kirk,\" she whispered against his shoulder. \"I understandtruly I do. And now just when we can be together again you're going to war\" He pressed his finger on her lips. \"Now, you promised not to talk about that when I joined up.

Linda tried to match the youthful ring in his voice. He leaped to his feet and pulled her up with him. \"I'm so excitedhope I don't forget anything.

WILHELMINA, Queen of the Netherlands for forty-five years last September 6, has been enthroned longer than ony other living monarch. Upon her fortunate escape to London from the invading Nazis, she announced, \"Black, silent night has settled on yet another corner of this earth. Over free Holland the lights have gone out.\" She fled in order to \"keep the banner aloft, unseen and yet ever present, for those who have lost their voice, but not -their hope nor their vision.\" 'The Netherlands Victoria, who ascended the throne at eighteen, ruled a scattered empire of 65,000,000 and had more gold, foreign exchange, and foreign secutities than any other nation in continental Europe  $6,000,000,000 worth. She had mote personal power than almost any other European monarchpower of absolute veto, of dissolving Parliament, of appointing AZ CD the fourteen members of the Council of State, which must be consulted on all legislation. Her personal courage and the social reformsthe most sweeping in Europewhich she carried through \"with a maximum of efficiency and a minimum of noise\" averted a socialist revolution after the last war. The democratic queen lived simply, cycled alone, skated and painted. Always high-principled and courageous, she also understands military and naval tactics, and foreign diplomats say they have never known any one with such a grasp of international affairs. Her own statesmanship is considered responsible for Holland's neutrality in the last war. Often she was better informed than her advising ministers and at once detected discrepancies or inaccuracies in their reports. She hopes for a just and Christian peace. May her voice be heard in peace negotiations!

The conditions in which Latterday Saints find themselves throughout the world, while we in the United States observe this Thanksgiving season, will vary widely as to matetial comforts and assurance, but in the things of the spirit which giveth life and hope, all may be equally blessed. That same testimony which strengthens and upholds a Church member in Zion or any of her stakes may be just as strong and potent in any other land, on the isles of the sea, at sea, or in the midst of battle. The Lord draws no boundaries, nor is He a respecter of persons. We are privileged to have been allowed to live upon the earth in this day, and we should seek to cast aside many of our fears and keep alive in our hearts the spirit of thanksgiving. Page 680 Shanks We should echo in our souls this song of praise: Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations (Psalm 100). May the spirit of thankfulness enterin us. May we be mindful of the goodness of the Lord. As we view the provisions which we have provided for our children according to the advice of our inspired leaders, as we live in accordance with the laws of the Gospel so that we may be in a position to ask for special blessings and protection whenever the need may arise,-let us always remember to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in our affairs, to resign our will to His, and ever keep alive in us the spirit of thanksgiving. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving (Col. 2:6-7)., M.

Whitaker Effie F. Meeks August 25, 1943 Western Canadian Cuaprer VIII Synopsis: Janet, reared in the East, martied to a western rancher, finds life all but unendurable in her San Juan desert home because of her torturing fears of the country and the Indians. After the birth and death of her first child she is unable to be happy enough with the man she loves to endure her surroundings. After a temporary reconciliation, she goes to Washington, D. C. For a visit with her father.... Three years go by in which neither Janet nor Paul finds happiness. They alternate between the East and the West, content with neither. When Janet learns she is to have another child, she stays on in Washington. Paul, overjoyed, plants a \"swing-tree\" for his son. While he is at work, Dr. Potsworth brings him a telegram informing him that Janet has twins. Paul's joy is tempered by the fear that Janet will never want to return to El Toro again, afraid for her children now. Dr. Potsworth gives her a month and a half to come home to show off her babies. Paul learns that Dr. Groneman, the specialist who attended Janet in the strange illness that preceded the birth of her first child, has lost his eyesight. Paul can but offer sanctuary to so true a friend, but he fears what the presence of a blind man in their home may do to Janet. JANET'S hand shook until she I could hardly hold the receiver to her ear. The thought of hearing Paul's voice again had all but unnerved her. Then the call went through. \"Hello. Hello, Paul!\" she cried. \"Janet! Darling, where are you? IsIs anything wrong?\" \"Of course not. I'm tired but otherwise perfectly all night. I can hardly wait for you to get here to help me home.\" \"Get to Washington? Janet, II can't come. J\" Page 682 \"I'm in Grayson, Paul. Didn't you get my telegram?\" \"Grayson! Janet, I'll be right up there. How are the babies? Janet, I'm as excited as a schoolboy!\" \"Paul, they're grand. You'd never \"Janet, let's not stop to talk.- I'll almost fly there. Good-by. No... Don't hang up! Where are you? Are you where you can rest till I get there? Oh, of course. I forgot about. Doc. Sure. Sure, he'll make you comfortable. Good-by, Janet. I'll burn up the roadboulders, sand, and dugways.... Good-by!\" Janet leaned against the wall for support, laughing, half crying. Dr. Potsworth beamed approval. \"He didn't get my telegram, Doctor. Whatever could have happened to it?\" \"Seems to me I saw something that might have been a telegram. Thought I'd saunter over to El Toro this afternoon with it. Paul'll save me a trip.\" \"You old conniver! You kept that telegram on purpose!\" Janet didn't know whether to laugh or be angry. She had counted so on Paul's being there to meet her. Doctor Potsworth chuckled. \"I must be getting old. To forget a thing like that!\" \"You didn't forget. You figured a little waiting would whet our appetites. I know you.\" She began to laugh. \"Oh it was good to hear Paul's voice! I can hardly wait to TOMORROW'S CUP see his eyes when I stack the twins in his arms.\" \"Aren't they a little young for such a trip?\" Potsworth innocently asked. \"Dr. Eldred was quite upset about it. He thought they were far too young. But even Rhae agreed that I owe Paul a sight of his own children.\" \"Paul owes me twelve heifer calves!\" the doctor said with seeming irrelevance. That night riding home in the car with Paul, excited and tired from her long trip from Washington, Janet listened to Paul's recital of all that had happened in her absence. He told her of the birth of Juanee's baby girl; of the death of the trapper's wife down on the river; about Warren Newsbaum's new dude ranch; Mike's periodic jail sentences. \"Did you ever find out how Mike got the turquoise cross from Juanee's mother?\" Janet asked. \"I think about that more than anything else.\" \"He tied her up and searched the lodge, but he didn't hurt her. That is not bodily; Mike's too big a coward for that. He knew Chief Dodge would kill him if he harmed her in anyway, so he kidnapped her.\" \"That wouldn't be an easy matter; she's a determined woman, Paul.\" \"Which accounts for the condition the lodge was in. She put up a pretty big fight. They hid her in a cave, leaving her to get home the best way she could, while they came straight to El Toro.\" \"If Chief Dodge had come and found her gone, Mike would have had plenty to worry about, the old 683 renegade. Much has happened, of course, since I left, Paul, but couldn't you really have come to Washington?\" \"You can't possibly know how much I wanted to come, Janet. I'd worked day and night to get things in shape so I couldand then Dr. Groneman came.\" \"Mark Groneman?\" Janet was surprised at this casual tone, a tone that sounded as if he were telling her something she already knew. He seemed nervous and apologetic, choosing his words with unnecessary care. \"You mean our Dr. Groneman? What are you saying, Paul?\" Janet was bewildered. \"Yes Janet, our Dr. Groneman. He is blind. HeWell, he's come to Fl Toro to spend the summer. Will you mind, Janet?\" \"Blind! Paul, that's incredible. You actually sound serious.\" At the mention of Mark Groneman's name, Janet had the feeling that she was still in that painfully semi-conscious state that had first brought Groneman to El Toro. \"I am serious, Janet. I wish with all my heart it weren't so.\" Janet steeled herself against the plea for understanding in his eyes. \"But Paul, even if what you say is true, why should he choose El Toro as his retreat from the world? What could his coming be but a wounded flight, like that of a maimed animal to its lair?\" Every fiber of her body cried out against it. El Toro had done enough to her! She wanted to be alone with Paul and her children. She had brought them back to El Toro because they were Paul's as well as hers; she had not expected to share them with a stranger. 684 \"I should have written to you about him,\" Paul apologized. \"I thoughtIs his coming an annoyance, Janet?\" 'There was grave disappointment in Paul's voice. Janet would have given anything to say she didn't mind, but her emotion was too great. A blind man groping from room to room, needing more care than a child. Helpless, despondentto come home to that! She tried to look at Paul, to say something commonplace, but couldn't. The desert had risen to strike her again. Not as a snake. Not as an Indian. In the guise of a friend! She forced herself to look at her husband. His face was white, his lips still. Paul expected her approval and she couldn't give it. Again she had not measured up. \"T'm sorry, Janet,\" he said, avoiding her eyes. \"Groneman will have to go.\" \"No, Paul. I'llI'll do my best not to let it make any difference. Just give me time toto get used to the idea.\" She glued her eyes to the distant peaks.. Paul had told her once that sometime something would make her belong to El Toro. Something kindly and welcoming, she supposed he meant. When? When? Would she ever need it more than now? \"Thanks, Janet,\" Paul said. \"If it proves too much for you, we'll work out something later.\" Janet laid her hand over his. Somewhere in the blue distance elephants marched along Gray Mesa; stars gleamed above Hotel Collins, and a night owl called. She had not been afraid that night on the Mesa; she would not be afraid now. \"TI feel better already,\" she said, and laughed with relief. THE months to come, were to show her that Dr. Groneman had not come to E] Toro as a wounded animal to lick its wounds, but as a man in search of a spiritual haven. His acceptance of the inevitable was an inspiration to her. His superb senses, his sensitive hands, the perfect coordination of his muscles made it possible for him to act independently, even in his blindness. Not once had she seen him stumble, and he never asked for help. He and Paul talked together hours on end and she often joined them in the patio when her work was done, and the babies were asleep for the night. They were strangely alike, these two men of such widely different paths. Both had an amazing capacity for the enjoyment of simple thingssand lilies, the smell of rain, the sound of wind in a canyon. Both had keen insight into the ways of plants and animals, wisdom concerning men. In their diversities they found stimulation. Dr. Potsworth often drove over during the evenings, and they'd talk far into the night. When Paul had to ride the range, Groneman turned to his typewriter and worked tirelessly. From the evenings' talks Janet knew much of what would go into those typewritten pages. Somehow it made El Toro seem the safest, happiest place in the world. Through his sightless eyes she was finding sight for her own. Unconsciously she'd fallen into the habit of close scrutiny of everything around her, for Dr. Groneman was sure to ask what she did and what she saw. Of all the things on the desert the yucca seemed to fascinate him most. One evening she remarked that the screen was white with tiny moths. TOMORROW'S CUP 'Yucca moths, no doubt,\" he said. Janet waited, knowing there was a story to follow. Presently he began: 'It's strange how the yucca achieves fertilization.... Seeing the white moths on the screen made me think of it.\" That was one of the delightful things about him. He always 'saw' the things they talked about. \"Tell me,\" she said. \"It must be significant, you are so thoughtful about it.\" \"It shows how utterly dependent we are, plants upon insects, people upon each other.\" There was a pause while he measured the length of his cane against his chest. \"The manner in which the yucca is fertilized,' he went on, \"is one of the wonders of plant life. In the bellshaped, pendulous blossom of our beautiful desert plant, the anthers containing the pollen dust are nowhere near the stigma cup that should receive it. So the plant depends upon certain little white moths to pollinate it, otherwise it couldn't survive.\" \"How interesting,\" Janet said enviously. \"I've been so absorbed with with other phases of the country less pleasant onesthat I have failed to notice things like that.\" \"We all have to become initiated. And not all of the things around us are as interesting as yucca moths. During the day they rest with folded wings, singly or in pairs, within the half-closed blossoms. But at night the female sets to work scraping pollen from the anthers. When she has secured enough for her needs, she shapes it into a pellet two or three times the size of her head, then flits away to another flower and de- 685 posits an egg in the soft tissue of the pistil. Then she runs to the top of the pistil, turns around and thrusts the pollen ball into its little funnel, poking it down with her head, unconsciously pollinating the plant. The seed that forms after pollination is the food for her young.\" Janet remained silent, seeing the desert forested with tall blossoming yucca plants. A white moth would never again be meaningless to her. \"I'm afraid I've thought too much about the spikes to appreciate the blossoms,\" she said. \"I read a story once of a Spanish native who tried to gain his freedom from slavery by attempting a passage through a thicket of 'Spanish bayonets,' \" \"Yucca Gloriosa,\" Groneman interrupted. \"Their stiff dagger-like leaves stand as high as a man's head. No wonder they are called bayonets. No flesh and blood creature could survive such an ordeal as trying to penetrate their thicket.\"\n\"No. The poor fellow didn't have a chance.\"\n\"But the spikes have a reason for their existence, Janet. They guard the most beautiful of all the yucca blossoms.\"\nGroneman got up and walked toward the door. \"Shall we brush the moths from the screen and sit in the patio?\" he asked. \"I hear the weird beat of the tom-toms.\"\n\"The Indians are making ready for the ceremonial dances. Juanee's boys can hardly wait till they are called to participate.\"\n\"Aren't they too young?\"\n\"That's left to the discretion of the chief.\"\n\"How old are they?\"\n\"Nine, and almost as resourceful as men. So perfectly one that they rarely act independently of each other,\" Janet said. \"I have watched them grow with almost as much pride as Juanee.\"\n\"Here they come now, riding like wild Comanches.\"\nJanet looked in all directions but could see no one. \"Why, how do you know that, Doctor Groneman?\" Then seeing his slow smile and his listening attitude, she understood. \"Your ears! I marvel at you more every day. I can hear the boys now, too.\"\n\"They ride fearlessly, don't they?\"\n\"That's the way they do everything. I'd be scared to death if they were my boys, but Juanee accepts that just as she does everything else. She's waiting in her doorway now, I'll wager, waiting to decide the winner.\"\n\"I hate to leave El Toro,\" the young doctor said unexpectedly.\nJanet hardly realized the significance of his words. \"Leave?\" she questioned.\n\"I shall go at the week end, Janet. I must get to a library and to a secretary. I've been lazy long enough.\"\nJanet didn't protest. She knew his fight was hardly begun; but also that he was equal to it. So she said quietly: \"Then we must do something special tomorrow.\"\nPaul came home soon after dark, and as soon as he had bathed and changed clothes he joined them in the patio. He relaxed into his favorite chair, stretching out his long frame and sighing with contentment.\nJanet asked after the affairs of the day.\n\"Oh, there's something I must tell you,\" Paul said. \"I went to the jail to see Mike as I promised you I would, Janet. The lazy old scamp is really enjoying himself. His latest sentence was up a month ago but he doesn't want to leave. Except for the matter of firewater he has everything he desires.\"\n\"Did you take him the grape juice I made?\"\n\"Sure thing. I took it to him on my way out to the range. I stopped again on the way back tonight. He thanked me civilly for your offering, but he was plainly mystified. 'What's matter?' he asked, rubbing his stomach in perplexity. 'No hot! Me drinkum one. Me drinkum two. Still me no sing!'\"\nGroneman roared with laughter. \"What a story to tell my colleagues,\" he cried. \"I'll be the center of attraction as long as my San Juan yarns hold out. That's one compensation for being a bachelorthere's always an audience.\"\n\"For escape literature?\" Janet laughed. \"I don't know whether that's complimentary or not.\"\nShe rose to go in. \"Poor old Mike, I forgave him long ago,\" she said. \"You two talk all night if you want to. I have a couple of live issues to settle all by myselfJerry and Paulette. They've been fussing for some time.\"\nLong after she had gone to bed Janet could hear the drone of the men's voices. Mark had told Paul, no doubt, that he was leaving to take up life again. What would they all be doing when they saw him again? The thought brought back a little of her old restlessness. With Dr. Groneman gone, Paul would be away more and more to catch up the tag ends of his neglected business.\n\"Remember the yucca moths,\" she said to cheer herself. \"The blossoms and not the spikes!\"\nShe went to sleep thinking of her father and Rhae, and she was lonely for the first time since she had come back from Washington.\nPaul left again at daylight. Janet woke with the determination that Mark Groneman's last day at El Toro must be something to remember. Something that would carry over to the hours of solitude that must come once he left the peace and security of El Toro. Traffic and frantic rush would replace the leisurely days and scented desert nights he'd spent here. If he had married, there might have been children to make all the difference, now that he so desperately needed something to anchor him.\nShe dressed hurriedly, planning a special breakfast to begin the day.\n\"Know what I'd like to do?\" Groneman asked, coming to the kitchen door. \"Umthat smells good. Hot maple syrup! Mind if I taste?\" He filled a spoon and sipped the syrup with boyish enjoyment.\n\"What would you like to do?\" Janet asked, understanding for the first time that this man was not unhappy, and that she and Paul had helped to make it so, and the twins, Jerry and Paulette. How unprofessionally he had rocked them to sleep! She knew, too, that in the years to come El Toro would claim this famous man again and again.\n\"Paulette is to be my special charge,\" Dr. Groneman said, almost as if he had read her thoughts. \"I have a big house and an aunt to manage it. When Paulette is six, I shall come for her.\"\nJanet laughed good-naturedly. \"She'll be engaged to Paul by that time; they are already inseparable. In the meantime we have a day to celebrate. What shall it be? What do you want to see?\"\n\"The San Juan River at the bridge. The Goosenecks; and if possible a storm on the desert!\"\nThe river! Janet steeled herself against her old instinctive fear. A dozen excuses clamored in her mind. Apparently inattentive, Dr. Groneman sipped another spoonful of syrup. You couldn't explain unreasoning fear to a man like that! And besides, this was his dayperhaps his last dayat El Toro.\nShe broke an egg into a bowl. \"Yes. Yes, we'll go to the river! We'll do all the sightsand come home\"\n\"Ravenously hungry,\" Dr. Groneman finished sagely.\n(To be continued)"

Now his hard hand touched it reverently, almost as a small son would smooth a mother's forehead. \"How about it, Belinda?\" he asked, eagerly.. \"All right, Kirk. I can't argue with you anymorenot in that uniform. So if that's the way you want itwe'll have a wedding.\" \"That's the way I want it.\" His brown eyes teased her. \"Never argue with a top sergeant: especially on his first furlough. Remember had to be plenty tough to win these stripes.\" Linda touched them, lovingly. Her eyes held a final plea. \"Please, Kirk, limit the invitations to close friends who are really glad it has turned out this way.' I don't want curious ones who would come to see the old scars\" Her voice stumbled. He knew she was remembering the very thing he was so eager for her to forget. She lifted her eyes, with the faint shadows at the corners, to his tall figure lounging on the arm of her chair. \"After all, Kirk, some people don't think a divorced woman rates a wedding\" He stooped and closed her trembling lips with his own steady ones. His kiss was quick and light. \"Is that so? Well, I think they do. In this case both the groom and the best man think sowhat they think ought to be good enough for the bride. Say!' His eyes flew to his wristwatch. \"He'll be here in an hour. We'll meet him at the train. Boy! I can hardly wait.\" He squeezed into the chair beside her and cradled her slender shoulders in the circle of his arm. \"Greg is the swellest guy in the world. That's one thing I'm set onyou and Greg seeing things eye to eye.\" He traced the smile on her lips with a tanned finger. \"Has Greg seen your uniform?\" she asked. \"Yeah. Last month when I came through Omaharemember? He's anxious to get back into one. Too bad that old shrapnel wound keeps him out of the army.\" Linda closed her eyes. Her head rested against his shoulder. \"Now remember,\" his young voice commanded. \"'He's going to take care of you while I'm in the war. That's why I stopped over in Omahato get that promise.\" \"You like Greg as much as ever?\" \"More than ever. He's tops. There isn't another fellow in the world who could step into my shoes \"? Linda's eyes widened. They were provocative. He continued watching her closely. \"Remember Lon Edwards? How far did he get when he tried to edge in? I had plans right from the start big ideas you called them, but I've made them come true, haven't I? I made up my mind to win\" \"You're a darling Kirk, even if you have been a jealous...\" \"And old money-in-the-bank Page 677 Hughes. Didn't I?\" \"Just think! I could have married all that money. Don't you feel selfish\" \"I do not.\" Now his voice tensed. \"This wedding is all I have thought about for three years. It could have happened a year ago but you had to think of your pride, as you called it.\" Linda stiffened. \"Don't go into that, Kirk.\" 'The words were icetipped. \"After all there are certain things that even you don't know about.\" \"OkayWe'll skip that part of it. But I have to go over itfor the last time, Belinda. I won't be satisfied unless I know the way you really feel about everything. I don't want you to marry again if you still feel bitter and disillusioned, if you are doing it just for me.\" There was a breathless silence. Linda's teeth left little white marks in her lower lips. When she spoke, he had to bend his head to hear. \"Kirk, I know you wonder why I have never discussed my divorce with you. That is the way I am, darling. I can't talk freely about the things that hurt me. At first, I thought it was all his fault. Lately I have realized it was mine, too. There were too many parties, too much freedom, and too little respect for marriage. I had to learn that men make easy love to an attractive woman. When you marry very young, you begin to wonder if you have missed a lot of thingsyou listen to flattery. Your husband tries the same thingthen you quarrel. Divorce is the next step and it happensno matter whom it hurts. That is the story, Kirk. All you need to reI got rid of him, too. Member is that I really want to try again.\" Kirk's breath came easier now and the world was in his eyes. His voice was husky. \"\"That's all I ask. Now I can go to war with my feet in the clouds. Dreams do come trueI can hold on to that thought when the going gets tough\" \"Kirk\" Linda held his hands in both of hers. \"I didn't realize how much it meant to you until lately. HonestlyI didn't.\" His eyes narrowed like a man looking against the sun. The pulse in his throat throbbed. \"I haven't thought of anything else since your divorce.\" Silence. Linda winced. \"I know now how you've felt all along, Kirk,\" she whispered against his shoulder. \"I understandtruly I do. And now just when we can be together again you're going to war\" He pressed his finger on her lips. \"Now, you promised not to talk about that when I joined up. We're going to think about the time when I come backremember? We'll buy a little place in the countryno more rooming houses for you to take care of. Of course we'll let Greg hang aroundGoodness, I almost forgot about him. Looks as if he'll be hanging around the rest of our lives!\" They laughed together. Linda tried to match the youthful ring in his voice. He leaped to his feet and pulled her up with him. \"I'm so excitedhope I don't forget anything. Let's see,\" he counted on his fingers. \"Ring, license, minister, best man, bride, bridegroom. Boy! Have I planned for this wedding! Listen, Pet.\" He tipped her (Continued on page 687)"

Stephens of Independence, Missouri. Sister Edna M. Bowman, who with her husband, President John F. Bowman, recently returned from the Central States Mission where she presided for four years over the Mission Relief Society, brought the quilt top to the General Board office, and related the interesting story of how it came into Sister Stephens' possession.\nSister Stephens, a convert to the Church from the Southern States, had been very active in Relief Society since her residence in Independence. At a social gathering of Relief Society sisters in her home some fifteen years ago, Miss Katherine McCowen was among the guests. Miss Kate, as she was called, was an old friend of Sister Stephens although she was not a member of the Church. During the conversation she casually mentioned that she had a quilt top among her possessions that had been made by her mother and Mrs. Oliver Cowdery. The sisters asked to see it, and a few weeks later Miss McCowen showed them this quilt top which they all greatly admired.\nThe quilt is made of red and gold percale blocks on unbleached muslin and is beautifully stitched. Miss Kate's mother said that most of the piece work was done by Mrs. Cowdery. Sister Stephens, fully appreciating its historic as well as its artistic value, asked Miss Kate what she intended to do with it. Miss Kate jokingly replied, \"I will will it to you when I die.\"\nDuring this past summer Miss Kate died at the age of eighty-five. Among her things was found this quilt top, with a note saying that it was to be given to Mrs. Mary A. Stephens.\nThe General Board expresses its appreciation to Sister Stephens for this beautiful and historic gift, and also to Sister Edna M. Bowman for delivering the quilt top. It will be added to the collection of valued historic articles now being preserved by the General Board.\nRexburg Stake (Idaho)\nThe following excerpt relating to war work is from the 1942 narrative report of Lucile Cullimore, stake Relief Society secretary: \"Due to the war the women of the stake have been urged and encouraged to help in all commendable war endeavors and the wards were asked wherever possible to organize as units to do Red Cross sewing. Those wards who could were encouraged to buy war bonds, which was also done by the stake board. Home-nursing courses, through the Red Cross, were also sponsored by the Relief Society and emergency first-aid nursing kits are being purchased in all wards. A hospital bed was purchased second hand jointly by the stake board and the four wards of Rexburg. Church welfare assignments have also been well executed.\"\nSouth Los Angeles Stake (California)\nHazel Dunford, counselor to President Hazel T. NeVille, is in charge of sewing in the South Los Angeles Stake. She recently sent the following report: \"We are happy to report all our wards have qualified 100 per cent in our emergency program. Each has a very large supply of medical supplies, more than filling the list suggested by the General Board, together with splints, cots, blankets, quilts, sheets, pillows, and emergency baby layettes.\n\"Seven of our wards have, under Red Cross instructors, completed the home-nursing course, and many more the Red Cross first-aid course, all outside of regular Relief Society time. We also sponsored a table at Red Cross headquarters, making surgical dressings.\n\"We have just completed our welfare assignment of forty quilts, all of new outing flannel and part-wool bats.\n\"The Relief Society stake board had printed and distributed to all homes of the stake 1,700 valuable folders on nutrition.\n\"From money raised as a stake board project, we have bought a $500 war bond and have also beautifully refurnished the ladies' lounge in the stake house.\n\"Our attendance has decreased due to so many women working, but the Relief Society visiting teachers still contact the homes 100 per cent in each ward.\"\nMaricopa Stake (Arizona)\nThe following excellent narrative statement of its 1942 bedding and canning project accompanied the Maricopa Stake Relief Society annual report for 1942: \"The bedding project which began in December 1941 was continued in 1942. Survey letters were distributed by visiting teachers to all women in Relief Society, listing the suggestive amount of linens and bedding adequate for a two years' supply. Each family was asked to return the survey form with the estimated number of each article they wished to purchase to complete their budget.\n\"The Relief Society stake board financed the project. Large purchases were made, some merchants offering discounts. Dozens of sheets, pillowcases, and other linens were bought. These were distributed to the wards according to their needs, and were purchased by the sisters. In wards where families were not able to buy these supplies, the ward officers were urged to work out a plan to assist the sisters. New pieces and used clothing were donated for quilt tops. Several hundred dollars' worth of outing flannel was bought and distributed at a reasonable price.\n\"At cotton-ginning season, the stake board was able to buy many bales of cotton, which was later felted in Phoenix. This cotton was sold to the sisters at cost, which was 18c to 20c a pound.\n\"Ward quilting, group quilting, and neighborhood quilting parties of all kinds took place during the summer. The wards were unable to give us a complete count of the bedding purchased or of the quilts made. At the last incomplete count there were nearly 1,300 quilts.\n\"In the early summer of 1942, the Relief Society stake board attempted a canning project. The purpose of the project was to locate available fruits and vegetables and stimulate the women to put away as much food as possible for the future. The committee in charge contacted local grocers and growers in order that they might obtain such produce in sufficient quantities at a fair price.\n\"Strawberries, apricots, tomatoes, and corn were canned. From a large farm south of Chandler, truck loads of culled new potatoes were purchased by the stake. These were bought and canned by the sisters in their homes. Later, carrots, cabbages, and cauliflowers were made available through the stake Relief Society. Women were urged to dry figs and corn, cure dates, and can all produce obtainable in the locality. Thus a very commendable beginning for intensive home canning was started, and many of our sisters are thankful for the extra food on their shelves.\"\nLong Beach Stake (California)\nPearl C. Miner, president of the Long Beach Stake Relief Society, reported in June 1943: \"Last week we were invited to present the program at the Victory Stand in Long Beach. Much publicity had been given our program by the local newspapers. Our municipal band played, musical talent was from our own Church members, and the stake Relief Society president was given the privilege of explaining the Welfare Program of our Church. We had a table on which were displayed samples of the various fruits, vegetables, tuna, vinegar, extracts, and soups canned in our welfare projects. We explained the purpose of the Welfare Program, and how each unit selected the projects suitable to its own locality and according to its ability to produce. We showed them our honey from the honey project of Santa Ana, the sorghum made from cane grown by our Huntington Beach group. Also, we displayed a number of our quilts that are made from good used wool pieces that have been cleaned and pressed and made into quilt blocks, and a few of the one hundred beautiful rayon dresses made as part of our welfare assignment. We sold forty thousand dollars worth of war bonds at this program.\n\"We have our first-aid kits in each ward. We are collecting articles for our loan closet, and think it is a splendid idea. Many of our women have completed their first-aid, nursing, or nutrition courses, and we hope to organize a number of home-nursing classes under the Red Cross in the near future.\n\"Each of our three Long Beach wards sponsors a bond and stamp booth downtown. We work through the stores, but our booths are out on the sidewalk. We have one of our ladies in each booth every day of the week, and have had one booth since the first of last November. We are doing a good work in our sales.\"\nOneida Stake (Idaho)\nStella W. Dalley, president of the Dayton Ward, reports: \"The accompanying photograph shows a typical quilting held by the Dayton Ward Relief Society during 1943. From January 1943 until June 8, 1943, 32 quilts were quilted by the ward Relief Society. Of this number, 4 were made for the Church Welfare Program, 5 were made for the ward Relief Society and 23 were quilted for ward members at a small fee to help the members secure adequate bedding for their families.\n\"The average attendance at the quiltings was 22. Seven full-day quiltings were held and 6 half-day quiltings on work-and-business days. Over 1,000 hours of quilting and sewing were done by the members of this ward Relief Society.\n\"This project was directly in charge of Second Counselor Kenna Bergeson, and sewing leaders Reta Virkbride and Alta Stuart.\"\nOakland Stake (California)\nA very interesting report on war work and the Relief Society, written by Ruth S. Hilton, president of Oakland Stake Relief Society, which would ordinarily appear with this group of reports in \"Notes from the Field\" was printed in the June-July issue of the Magazine, page 424, as a highlight to the general secretary's annual report. Reference is made to this issue of the Magazine for this stake's excellent report of war work.\nSnowflake Stake (Arizona)\nThe following excerpt is from the narrative annual report for 1942 of the Snowflake Stake Relief Society, of which Leonora S. Rogers is president. \"In June, through the help of the ward Societies, the stake board donated fifteen complete temple suits to the Arizona Temple. In July, a shower of bed linen and dishes for our local maternity hospital was giventhere were 24 bed sheets, 11 pairs of pillowcases, and 142 dishes. Another donation of 179 quarts of bottled fruit and vegetables was given to the hospital on Thanksgiving Day.\n\"During the summer work-and-business meetings, the wards made and remodeled over 300 articles of clothing for the stake bishops' storehouse. We had no dentist available for our annual check-up on teeth, therefore the wards invested their health fund donations in war bonds, to the amount of $1,042.72.\n\"Many of our wards are taking courses in Red Cross work and nutrition.\"\nPhoenix Stake (Arizona)\nMele D. Mortensen, president of Phoenix Stake Relief Society, reported in connection with this stake's 1942 annual report: \"We had a welfare project in which we made an effort to have every home in our stake completely supplied with bedding and one year's supply of food. About 1,500 pounds of beans were bought and distributed in the stake.\n\"Blankets to the value of $200 were bought from Utah mills and sold to the people of our stake. We had a paper project and gathered tons of newspapers and magazines and cleared $160. We also had a sweet potato project and grew about 1 2/3 acres of potatoes. It was not a financial success, but we cleared a little more than it cost us. We only wish we had it this year as potatoes are so high. We have a wonderful group of sisters on our board and are proud of their testimonies. They desire to do their part in helping to carry forward the Lord's work. We hold a board meeting about every five or six weeks, and at each meeting we quilt a quilt for one of the wards to help in their welfare assignment.\n\"As you know, our stake is new and we have had a stake building erected in connection with our Third Ward. In this building there were some rooms provided for the stake Relief Society, and we have been trying to furnish those rooms. We have secured some of the furniture and are able to hold all of our board meetings there now.\"\nChicago Stake (Illinois)\nLois Astin, stake Relief Society president, and Elizabeth W. Hansen, stake secretary-treasurer, jointly submitted the 1942 narrative report from which the following excerpts are taken: \"Through the splendid cooperation of the wards and branches our canning and sewing projects have been very successful. To date, 586 articles of children's and women's clothing have been completed and approximately 2,000 quarts of fruits and vegetables have been canned. These have been turned over to the respective bishops and the stake welfare committee. One hundred twenty-nine yards of outing flannel were given out November 23 at our quarterly conference for the making of children's pajamas. These will be returned February 27 when our sisters come in for conference. One branch, besides participating in the stake sewing project, made quilts for eight of its members. Country stores, dinners, bazaars, and apron sales have been given to help the wards and branches raise cash for their Church welfare assignments.\"\nInglewood Stake (California)\nJosephine Prestwich, stake Relief Society president, included in her 1942 narrative report the following statement: \"Our wards had a Relief Society bedding project last summer and each ward was asked to make 6 or more quilts, one dozen sheets, pillowcases, towels, and at least 3 layettes. They were also instructed in making bandages, and some of our women have attended first-aid classes.\"\nThe University of the Home (Continued from page 660)\nstrict accountability any son or daughter who casts off an aged father or mother.\nAll institutions of learning enjoy the inspiration of a well-selected school song. A song that might be appropriately used in the sanctity of the home because it represents the epitome of students' relationship to their Heavenly Father, is, \"I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord, over mountain or plain or sea. I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord. I'll be what you want me to be.\"\nAnd its motto, \"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old he will not depart from it,\" will prepare the reapers of a questionable future harvest to meet the issues of life, to solve its problems, and to achieve fully a destiny of fruitful service.\nFor Christmas This Year (Continued from page 676)\nbottle of mustard pickles wrapped in red cellophane or other Christmas paper. Tie the package with a ribbon and a little original Christmas jingle and it will be gratefully received in these days of food rationing. One recipient of a pudding last year thought it so attractive she hung it on her Christmas tree.\nSpeaking of Christmas trees, if you have very few baubles or decorations for a tree this year there are many things that you can make that will be interesting as well as pretty. Strings of popcorn may be tinted with gelatine coloring and alternated frequently with colored peanuts. Popcorn balls or dainty popcorn baskets made with loops of string fastened inside so they can be hung on the tree make attractive decorations, also.\nFancy Christmas bread and cookies can be made in various shapes, such as stars, reindeer, rabbits, airplanes, Santa Claus, nursery characters, etc., and decorated with white and colored frostings and hung on the tree. Use cookie cutters or else cut out your own patterns with a sharp knife. Crochet red mesh bags or miniature stockings to hold candy, nuts, and cookies for the tree, or make pretty little boxes to hold the goodies. One of these containers given to children who view the tree, will delight the youngsters."

            "content": "The University of the Home Elder Joseph L. Wirthlin Member of the Presiding Bishopric EEPLY carved in solid stone over the portals of one of Washington, D. C.'s _ great buildings, the following deeply significant statement is found: \"The seed of the past is the harvest of the future.\" A short sentence, but pregnant with much food for serious thinking. The seeds being sown today are of a great varietysome good, others pernicious and noxious. All good husbandmen become familiar with the harmful as well as the good seeds, being able thereby to identify them and root them up before a rich and abundant harvest is ruined. Many of the noxious seeds are being sown about us daily and are so prevalent they are becoming very common to us: Seeds of indebtedness of such proportions in national, state, and local governments by which the shackles of bondage will be securely clasped on unborn generations the moment mortality becomes their heritage. Seeds which promulgate the false and insidious doctrine that Jesus Christ was not the Only Begotten in the flesh and the Savior of mankind but may have been a great teacher or prophet, which doctrine has led the races of man away from the true and lasting plan of peace and into the shambles of battle. Seeds which enslave the body to the use of powerful destructive drugs, namely nicotine and alcohol (A drugged nation has but one destinydecay and oblivion). Page 656 Seeds of disrespect for Constitutional Government, which lead to dictatorship and loss of representative government. Seeds of the corrupt philosophy that men have a right to expect a living from the world without any mental or physical effort upon their part, producing a generation of parasites, willing and anxious to devour the bread of the worker. These seeds largely. Determine what the future harvest will be and the question arises, who will reap the harvest and where are these reapers? The reapers of tomorrow's harvest are in your home and mine. They are the boys and the girls of today. And now another word appearsthe word home. What is its meaning? Webster defines it as a dwelling place, the house in which one lives with his family. The home is all of this and more. It is the first unit of government and church organization. It is the greatest institution of learning in the world. So aptly said by George Herbert, \"The first university is the University of the Home. Here the hours of recitation are the morning, the noon, and the night. Here we find the round table of infancy and parenthood. Here are discussed the problems of the present and the possibilities of the coming years. Here sit the scholars of youth and maidenhood. Here are enthroned two great chairs endowed by destiny and sustained by human affection, fatherhood and motherhood. The greatest university in the UNIVERSITY OF THE HOME world is the home.\" Over the portals of every university of the home, the words of the ancient writer of Proverbs might well be inscribed: \"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\" The home is a great place of preparation for the men and women of tomorrow, the future reapers of a harvest of complexities, problems and issues which will demand the highest in morals, character, mentality, and physical strength. The head of this institution in every real Latter-day Saint home is a servant of God, holding the Melchizedek Priesthood, which entitles him to receive from on high divine direction for the good and benefit of those who reside within his household. The faculty of the University of the Home is comprised of two individualsfather, the head, and mother. Students enrolling will be sent from on high, entrusted by their Heavenly Parents for their education and training in mortality to this faculty. The responsibility thus placed upon the faculty of the University of the Home is most sacred, as the Heavenly Parents of these students desire that they will be so educated and trained that some day they may again return to their heavenly home. HE faculty of the University of the Home should provide a curriculum comprised of those courses which will achieve the finest and highest in. The training of the heart, the head, and the hands of these students., In training the heart, it is to be fully understood that this most important organ first vitalizes the body, 657 keeps it alive. It is the seat of all emotions and the greatest emotion to be cultivated and stimulated is that of love. The first and great - commandment is to love God, the Eternal Father, with all of one's heart and soul and mind; and. The second one is likened unto it, to love one's neighbor as one's self. The first lesson in the training of the heart is in the form of an introduction to the Lord through the channel of prayer. All students of the University of the Home, regardless of age, should surround the family altar of prayer both morning and night, thus teaching them the necessity of constant communication with God, their Eternal Father, which communication and supplication will inculcate into their hearts faith in, respect for, and love for the Lord and His Son Jesus Christ. With the gift of faith. Bestowed from on high comes a desire to obey the commandments of God, and over the years of childhood and adolescence there comes understanding of the Lord's purposes. From a composite of faith, obedience, and understanding comes the greatest of the Lord's blessings, namely, a testimony or divine revelation through ithe power and the gift of the Holy Ghost that God lives, that His Son Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph Smith was an instrument in the hands of God whereby the Gospel was restored and the Church again established upon the earth. Love for one's neighbor is a lesson of paramount importance. Love is a great motivating, stimulating passion, which creates a desire to render service, and this lesson can 658 best be exemplified in rendering service in the home, first on the part of each family member, one to another, and second to one's neighbors, which service is best exemplified through the medium of the Church in the fast offering and tithing principles, in the Welfare Program, and in preaching the Gospel to the nations of the earth. Another great and important love is that for country, its fundamental law the Constitution, and all of its fine traditions. The faculty of the University of the Home will be most remiss in its teaching if it fails to call students to a consideration of the Constitution of the United States. Students should come to know and fully realize that the Constitution made possible the establishment of a great republican form of Government, under whose protection the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ could be restored again upon the earth, that according to the word of the Lord-to His prophet, He suffered it, the Constitution, to be established and to be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 101:77), and that the Lord's prophets from the day of Joseph Smith until the present time have looked upon it as a divine document, so divine that it is literally a part of the religion of every devout and faithful Latter-day Saint. Students should be impressed with the necessity of guarding this sacred document to the end that rather than give up any of its guarantees for freedom of worship, freedom of speech, the right to own property, and rather than remove from it those elements which have built up our great nation on the principle of personal initiative and free enterprise, they should defend it to the last drop of blood. It should be made clear to them that this great land is a choice land above all other lands and is not to be plagued by a king or a dictator, that under the Constitution of the United States more benefits have been created for more people than in any other nation in all the world. In the matter of training the mind, the University of the Home has a definite obligation, while it is generally recognized the training of the mind is highly technical and is generally left to other institutions of learning. Students of the home should be taught to distinguish between that which is true and false, between the insidious doctrine of man and the doctrine of the Lord the doctrine of man having as its objective the disruption of faith in God and His purposes. Students in the University of the Home entering other institutions should have so ingrained in their hearts and minds an understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that the doctrines and teachings of men will be as chaff. In other words, students of the University of the Home should understand as the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, \"The glory of God is intelligence\"; and the glory of God is intelligence when pure knowledge is used in righteous endeavor and in building up the Kingdom of God.- The curriculum of the University of the Home should provide an intense training of the hands. This training begins in childhood. First, the child should be taught to remember that his clothing, his food, his UNIVERSITY OF THE HOME home, and all of his materialistic blessings are the result of someone else's labor. 'Therefore, he should appreciate what it costs in labor to secure the necessities of life. Boys and girls should be given simple tasks to perform in and about the home, teaching them the great fundamental of efficiency. Efficiency is the most important fundamental to success in any endeavor. Girls should be taught all of those tasks which will go to make them efficient, capable home managers. Boys who reside on farms should be taught in the matters of plowing, irrigation, feeding, and handling of livestock and to do these so efficiently that the best results may be realized. With this fundamental training given in the home, efficiency will become a very part of the lives of these men and women of tomorrow and their efforts will be crowned with success. Students of the University of the Home should be taught that the darkest hour in any man or woman's life is when he sits down to plan to get something without working for it. Brigham Young's axiom on indolence indicates that laziness travels slowly and is soon overtaken by poverty. Moreover, each child should be taught to sustain himself rather than anticipate sustenance from any governmental agency, for after all the Government is a perpetual consumer, a consumer of the people's taxes; and because of the fact that the people sustain the Government out of their resources, in no instance should the Government support the people. Whenever a child or an individual thinks he can be dependent upon society, then he becomes an enemy of society. 659 The University of the Home library should be supplied with the finest of books. First the books ot the Lord: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price should be available, in addition to many more volumes written by inspired men. Surveys indicate that youth reads innumerable trashy periodicals dealing with crime and sex problems. The reading of such material can be obviated by home guidance in the proper selection of reading material. The brain is a vast storehouse of thoughts and knowledge. Thought and knowledge become the parents of deeds, either for good or evilfirst the thought and then the deed. Thoughts are but deeds in the embryo. Student-body activities in the University of the Home should be so broad as to include all activity which should give expression to the highest ideals, whether in the dance, games, athletics, drama, music, etc. After all, the recreational activities in the University of the Home should be the measure, the index by which the world will judge Latter-day Saint homes. Recreation and pleasure satisfy the desires of the heart. The kind of music listened to, the books that are read, the dramas that are enjoyed, the people associated with these are the best index to ideals and culture. The faculty of the University of the Home should impressively teach God's law of health by setting the proper example, abstaining from those things which are not good for the body. A coffee-pot or a teapot on the back of the stove is an invitation to any young man or any young 660 woman to partake of intoxicating beverages or tobacco. Students of the University of the Home should be taught that the first requisites for success are a strong, clean mind and body. More than that, the Lord's spirit will tabernacle itself in clean bodies, revealing, as the Lord promised, great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures. 'The senior year of the University of the Home should be given over largely to the greatest lesson, namely, the lesson of life, the effectiveness of its teaching being evidenced by obeying the first great commandment of multiplying and replenishing the earth. Young men and young women ought to be taught that life has but two purposes: first, a manifestation of love for God and rendering obedience to His commandments; and second, through such obedience affording an opportunity to many of the unborn spirits the privilege of coming into this school of mortality and taking upon themselves bodies of flesh and bone. The lesson of life should be taught so clearly that students will fully comprehend that the achievement of the objectives of life are wholly contingent upon chasteness and lives that are wholly compatible with the Gospel, which should entitle any young man or woman to make claim on the bishop for a temple recommend to the Lord's house for the purpose of being united for time and eternity with one's life mate as a reward for a clean obedient life. These lessons properly taught in the University of the Home will eliminate many embarrassing situations when young men and young women appear before the bishop requesting the privilege of going into the Lord's house, and are placed upon probation for a period because of a lack of knowledge of the requirements and not living the proper kind of a life. HE inevitable day of graduation will come and the theme of the commencement exercises should be that which is found in the words of Jehovah to Joshua when Joshua stood on the heights of the promised land with the hordes of the children of Israel at his back. 'Then the voice of Jehovah said, \"Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest\" (Joshua.1:9). Graduates of the University of the Home will stand upon the heights of their promised land and they, too, should be strong and of good courage, know no fear, nor should they be dismayed, for God their Heavenly Father will be with them insofar as they live the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Moreover He will qualify them to reap the uncertain harvest of the future. Their destiny is one of leadership and the Lord will qualify them for that leadership. One more word of advice to graduates, try to understand fully the fifth commandment given to Moses on Sinai, \"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" Honor them during their declining years, never forget that father and mother who nurtured you in your childhood, fully sustaining you throughout young manhood and young woman hood, and that God will hold to (Continued on page 694)"

            "content": "For Christmas This Year Nellie O. Parker Member of the Relief Society General Board E can bring a freshness of spirit to Christmas this year and a determination to make the best of the situation which the war has imposed upon us. Dearth of material things which we have been accustomed to use for our celebration, will challenge our resourcefulness. 'The metal which made trinkets and toys and baubles has long since gone to war, and restricted production of commodities and utilities, as well as a shortage of some types of food present other problems for us. But as a statesman recently reminded us, \"A crisis can be made a time of opportunity if imagination and ingenuity are called into action.\" First of all we can give the day the full spiritual significance for which it was instituted by Christian people. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, and the Son gave Himself, even His life that the children of earth would know the right pattern of living which would bring them joy and peace in this life and hope for the eternity which follows.\". Christmas is a commemoration of this day when His Son was born and it has been established by long custom on December 25 as the day on which we celebrate Christ's birth. This year we can make it a day of gratitude and thanksgiving to God. We can radiate more love and kindness by being more thoughtful and unselfish and by extending good will not only to our friends but to others, The' especially to the needy and less fortunate. You remember Jesus said, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Jesus gave Himself unstintingly; we can give more of ourselves with our gifts and they will be greatly enriched, as \"The gift without the giver is bare.\" We should try to make our gifts and decorations out of the things we have, rather than try to buy from a market of scarcity and often inferior quality. We should take stock of our resources, salvage and repair decorations of former years. From trunks and closets we may search for material which can be used to make articles which will make very acceptable presents. To mention a few of the things which can be made from used material there are rugsbraided, crocheted, woven, or made of small] pieces of cloth sewed in a design to a burlap or canvas back and outlined with thread. Old sweaters can be unraveled and made over into scarfs, mittens, caps, slippers, or afghans. Felt hats, the brighter the better, can be cut into pieces and appliqued on various things: for book markers; for children's Alpine sets hats, belts, and purses; for corsages, etc. Men's trousers, especially those belonging to boys who have gone into the service, which will be too small for them when they return, can be made into attractive little pleated skirts or jumper dresses for little girls. 'The seams can be hidden under the pleats and when the Page 675 676 articles are cleaned and _ beautifully pressed they will make as fine gifts as any purchased at a store. Good looking little boy suits can also be made. 'The secret lies in copying good patterns, sewing the suits carefully, then pressing them well. Adult coats can be made into smaller coats and some of them are very suitable for snowsuits. The best parts of an old bathrobe can be used in making a child's robe, especially if a little new material is used for collar and cuffs. Sugar sacks make very attractive luncheon sets when bleached and edged with colored rickrack or coarse lace, with a simple motif outlined in a corner to match the edging. Ten-pound sacks make a nice size for a place mat. One end may be decorated with a band of bright material and a motif repeating the same color may be placed on the other end. The smaller five-pound bags can be used for the napkins. These same size bags will make attractive quilt blocks, especially if dainty flowered percale is appliqued on them in some pretty design. Scrapbooks containing good continued magazine stories, collected and pasted neatly together with their illustrations will make welcome gifts for service men in shut-in places, such as on submarines or troop ships, or for convalescents in hospitals, etc. Collections of funny stories and riddles will also spread cheer and entertainment and will afford the maker plenty of opportunity for artistic expression in creating attractive covers for them. For favors, pieces of hard differentcolored candy, nuts, and raisins may be covered with bits of cellophane, twisting the ends to make a stem, and grouped together like a bunch of grapes or like a corsage with lace paper doily for a base. Be sure to make the whole house look festive and cheerful. A large bowl of pyracantha from the garden set before a mirror will give a beautiful red and green picture, or wreaths may be made from evergreen boughs, tied with red ribbon or chintz, and hung over a mirror or on the front door. Put candles at the base of the mirror. Frame a window, mirror, or archway with green and with red paper bells and festoons. A beautiful winter table scene may be made by whitening tumble weed with kalsomine and glitter and arranging it on a mirror with miniature reindeer, china birds, or little houses grouped around in front of it. The story of the first Christmas may be told by pictures cut from magazines and placed on the mantel or wall. Scotch tape will hold the pictures in place without injuring the wall. A display of beautiful Christmas cards of this and former years placed around the living room adds to the spirit of the occasion. If we make the things we do have interesting, striking, and abundant, then no one will miss the things we do not have. In addition, if we give full measure of friendliness, and if we reach out with kindness, then Christmas this year can be one which will in reality reflect the Christmas spirit. There are gifts from our kitchens we can share with othersa carrot pudding, a loaf of Boston brown bread, a cleverly arranged box or plate of cookies, a glass of jelly or a (Continued on page 694)"

That the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.\nAim: To show what is meant by the regeneration of the earth, and when and how the earth is to be renewed; to explain the resurrections, the millennial reign, the loosing of Lucifer for a little season, the new heaven and new earth, and to show what the relationship of man is to each.\nCONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 21, TALMAGE'S ARTICLES OF FAITH\nRENEWAL OF THE EARTH\nThe Earth Under the Curse\nThe blessed conditions under which the earth shall exist and man shall live during the millennial era are almost beyond human powers of comprehension, so different are they from all to which history testifies and experience confirms. The description of Eden is to us as the story of another world, yet Eden was a feature of our planet, and the earth is destined to become a celestialized body.\nRegeneration of the Earth\nA time of restitution is foretold (Acts 3:19-21; Rom. 8:21-23). The final stages of the regeneration of nature will not be reached until the Millennium has run its blessed course. Describing the events to take place after the completion of the thousand years, John the Revelator wrote: \"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea\" (Rev. 21:1). A similar prediction was made by Ether the Jaredite (Ether 13:9). In the year 1830 of our present era, the Lord said: \"... When the thousand years are ended, and men again begin to deny their God, then will I spare the earth but for a little season; and the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed and pass away, and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth\" (Doctrine and Covenants 29: 22-23).\nAccording to the scriptures, the earth has to undergo a change analogous to death, and is to be regenerated in a way comparable to a resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 88:25-26). During the Millennium, the earth will be tenanted by both mortal and immortal beings; but after the regeneration is complete death will no longer be known among its inhabitants. Then the Redeemer of earth \"shall deliver up the kingdom, and present it unto the Father, spotless, saying: I have overcome\" (Doctrine and Covenants 76:107). The last foe to be vanquished is death (I Cor. 15:24-26).\nThe following partial description of the earth in its regenerated state has been given by the Prophet Joseph Smith in this dispensation: \"This earth, in its sanctified and immortal state, will be made like unto crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom, or all kingdoms of a lower order, will be manifest to those who dwell on it; and this earth will be Christ's\" (Doctrine and Covenants 130:9).\nAttempts have been made to demonstrate an agreement between the teachings of science concerning the destiny of the earth, and scriptural predictions regarding the ordained regeneration of our planet by which it is to be made fit for the abode of immortalized souls. It may suffice to say that the so-called evidence is unsatisfactory. However, let us not, because of this, disparage science nor decry the labors of its votaries. No one realizes more fully than does the mind trained to scientific method how much we do not know.\nThe Resurrection from the Dead\nClosely associated with, and analogous to, the ordained rejuvenation of earth, whereby our planet is to pass from its present dreary and broken state to a condition of glorified perfection, is the resurrection of the bodies of all beings who have had an existence upon it. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches the doctrine of a literal resurrection; an actual reunion of the spirits of the dead and the tabernacles with which they were clothed during mortal probation; and a transition from mortality to immortality in the case of some who will be in the flesh at the time of the Lord's advent, and who, because of individual righteousness, are to be spared the sleep of the grave.\nHuman knowledge of the resurrection rests wholly upon revelation.\nPredictions Concerning the Resurrection\nThe prophets in the past dispensations of the world's history have foreseen and foretold the final conquest of death. Some of them testified specifically of Christ's victory over the tomb; others have dwelt upon the resurrection in a general way (Job 19:25-26; Isa. 26:19; Ezk. 37:11-14; Hos. 13:14; Matt. 12:40; 14:1-2; 16: 21; 17:23; 20:19; 22:31-32; Luke 14: 14; John 3:14-15; 5:24-25; Pearl of Great Price: Moses 7:56-57; II Nephi 9:6, 12-13; Helaman 14:15-17; Mosiah 15:20-24; Alma 40:2-6, 16-24).\nTo Martha, bewailing the death of her brother Lazarus, the Messiah declared: \"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live\" (John 11:25).\nTwo General Resurrections\nTwo general resurrections are mentioned in the scriptures, and these may be specified as first and final, or as the resurrection of the just and the resurrection of the unjust. The first was inaugurated by the resurrection of Jesus Christ; immediately following which many of the saints came forth from their graves. A continuation of this, the resurrection of the just, has been in operation since, and will be greatly extended, or brought to pass in a general way, in connection with the coming of Christ in His glory. The final resurrection will be deferred until the end of the thousand years of peace, and will be in connection with the last judgment.\nThe resurrection was a favorite theme with Paul, and he gave it frequent and prominent attention (Rom. 6:5; 8:11; I Cor. Chap. 15; II Cor. 4:14; Philip. 3:21; Col. 3:4; I Thess. 4:14; Heb. 6:2). Modern revelation renews the promises made of old, and clearly indicates in solemn warning the magnitude of that which is to come (Doctrine and Covenants 42:45; 43:17-18; and many others).\nSUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE\nSuggested Songs\n\"I Know That My Redeemer Lives,\" L.

At the conclusion of these talks class members representing investigators may ask questions, make comments, or give opinions. The questions of investigators may be answered by any member of the class, who might cite scriptural quotations in support of her answer. A special musical number at the beginning or close of the cottage meeting will contribute to the character of the lesson presentation as a cottage meeting. Class members should be urged to bring copies of the standard Church works to this meeting, and class leaders should provide opportunity for their use by class members.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nTeachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, 1938 edition:\nThe expectation of seeing my friends in the morning of the resurrection cheers my soul and makes me bear up against the evils of life. It is like their taking a long journey, and on their return we meet them with increased joy.\nGod has revealed His Son from the heavens and the doctrine of the resurrection also; and we have a knowledge that those we bury here God will bring up again, clothed upon and quickened by the Spirit of the great God; and what mattereth it whether we lay them down, or we lay down with them when we can keep them no longer? Let these truths sink down in our hearts, that we may even here begin to enjoy that which shall be in full hereafter. Page 296.\nDiscourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925:\nResurrection Necessary to Full Salvation\nNo man can enter the celestial kingdom and be crowned with a celestial glory, until he gets his resurrected body; but Joseph and the faithful who have died have gained a victory over the power of the Devil, which you and I have not yet gained. So long as we live in these tabernacles, so long we will be subject to the temptations and power of the Devil; but when we lay them down, if we have been faithful, we have gained the victory so far; but even then we are not so far advanced at once as to be beyond the neighborhood of evil spirits. Page 575.\nGospel Doctrine, edition 1919:\nOur Indestructible, Immortal Identity\nWhat a glorious thing it is to know and be true to that which has been revealed in these latter times through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It was revealed anciently by the Savior himself, and he exemplified that glorious principle of which I wish to say a few words, and which has been renewed and emphasized more especially in these latter days through Joseph SmithI refer to our identity, our indestructible, immortal identity. As in Christ we have the example, he was born of woman, he lived, he died, and he lived again in his own person and being, bearing even the marks of the wounds in his flesh, after his resurrection from the deadso also a testimony has been given to you, in later days through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and others who have been blessed with knowledge, that the same individual Being still lives and will always live. Jesus is possessed of immortality, and eternal life; and in evidence of his existence and his immortality, and in evidence of the great and glorious truths of the gospel which he taught, the death which he died, and the resurrection that he wrought from the dead, he has revealed himself and borne his own record and testimony to those who have lived and still live in this day and age.\nWhat a glorious thought it is, to me at least, and it must be to all who have conceived of the truth or received it in their hearts, that those from whom we have to part here, we will meet again and see as they are. We will meet the same identical being that we associated with here in the fleshnot some other soul, some other being, or the same being in some other form, but the same identity and the same form and likeness, the same person we knew and were associated with in our mortal existence, even to the wounds in the flesh. Not that a person will always be marred by scars, wounds, deformities, defects or infirmities, for these will be removed in their course, in their proper time, according to the merciful providence of God. Deformity will be removed; defects will be eliminated, and men and women shall attain to the perfection of their spirits, to the perfection that God designed in the beginning.\nIt is his purpose that men and women, his children, born to become heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, shall be made perfect, physically as well as spiritually, through obedience to the law by which he has provided the means that perfection shall come to all his children.

To cooperate with others often multiplies our strength. \"No man liveth unto himself.\" We are all members of a group. One of the great factors in the fine art of living is knowing how to get along with others. To be pleasant to live with is an attractive and much coveted characteristic. It adds greatly to one's usefulness and to one's happiness.\nOne of the best places to cultivate this spirit of cooperation is in our Church work and one of the best places to practice it is in the home. Where there is a spirit of cooperation in the home, where the husband and the wife, the parents and the children are happily united and all work together, they are able to meet reverses and are pretty sure to succeed. Where there is unity, there is strength.\nWe recall the story of the old man, who, on his death bed, called his sons about him. Pointing to a bundle of fagots he said, \"Take one of them and break it. Take two of them and break them. You see they are easily broken, a few of them at a time, but bind these together in a bundle and try with all your might and you cannot break them.\" There is strength in unity.\nOne of the essentials in getting along with people is to enjoy their confidence, and the way to do that is to be loyal to them, to sustain and build them up, to look for the good and express appreciation of it. No one ever got very high by pulling other people down. To pull a person down is the easiest thing in the world. It takes only a small mind to do that, in fact, it is the expression of a small mind.\nUnselfishness is another secret of cooperation, of getting along with people. The willingness to give to others, to promote them, to advance their interests has in it something people like. When one encourages and does for those with whom and for whom he works, they will work for him.\nOne of the basic truths of human life is that we are essentially social. We cannot live alone. We are not Robinson Crusoes. A second great truth is that the individual owes a debt to the community and to the race; and a third is embodied in the ideal of service, \"Freely ye have received. Freely give.\"\nAgain, the Church is a training school in cooperation which involves the element of service, the desire to do for others, willingness to sacrifice our own interests for the good of other people.\nDiscussion\n1. What are essential factors in effective cooperation?\n2.

If the kind of furnishings are chosen that are easy to keep clean, if every possible provision is made for keeping dirt out of the house, if work is carefully planned, and if good cleaning methods are used, the upheavals that result in discomfort for the entire household need not accompany housecleaning.\nSystematic housecleaning saves labor in the long run, is easier on furnishings, and is economical of material used in the care of the house. Almost every housekeeper has a more or less fixed routine of work, which might be called her plan. It is wise for the housekeeper to occasionally review her work routine to see whether or not her housecleaning is so organized as to be accomplished with a minimum of time and energy. In these days, when competent household help is at a premium, it is wise economy to \"make the head save the heels.\"\nTo keep clean rather than to make clean is a thoroughly practical working principle. This means daily tidying of the rooms in constant use, distributing the cleaningespecially the heavy kindsthrough the week, and removing dirt not only frequently but thoroughly by methods that have been proved good according to both scientific and practical standards.\nDirt has been described as \"matter out of place.\" Just as weeds in a garden are plants out of place which may eventually choke out the flowers and vegetables, so dirt from the earth, soot and oily smoke which filter into the house or come from heating and cooking equipment may eventually injure the hardiest surface. A thin film of dirt is easily and quickly removed, but when dirt is permitted to accumulate it cakes and hardens, and surfaces may then be damaged by the more drastic measures that are necessary to clean them. Frequent light cleaning is economical in that it reduces the cost of refinishing and replacements.\nDirt may be kept from being tracked into the house by such simple devices as placing mats at outside doors, by daily sweeping of walks and porches, etc. This takes less time in the end than cleaning up dirt after it has been tracked into the house, and it also saves wear and tear on rugs and floors. If wet, dirty, and muddy clothes can be removed in an entrance hall much cleaning can be avoided.\nFrequent brushing of outside window sills and the use of cheesecloth-covered screens on windows that are open frequently, for instance in pantries and halls, help to keep out dirt. Covered screens may be used to filter out both dirt and dampness on bedroom windows which are open at night.\nThe housekeeper must not only keep dirt out of the house, but she must also arrange for the systematic removal of that which enters the house. The easiest way to manage housecleaning is to have a schedule for daily, weekly, and monthly cleaning. (See Lesson I, \"Home Management,\"-July, p. 438). Consideration must be given to proper cleaning equipment and supplies. We suggest that the housekeeper visit her hardware stores and see what they have to offer in the way of housecleaning supplies. She may discover a handy clothesline or the latest model of carpet sweeper. Perchance it will be a scrub pail which is light in weight and not cumbersome, or she may find a kneeling cushion which will save aching knees as she scrubs. A stepladder which has a firm base and does not wobble may appeal to her. Perchance she will visit a paint shop and discover the very enamel she wants for doing over some of her kitchen furniture. She may find handy brushes which fit the dusty corners, Venetian-blind brushes, scrub brushes made to fit the hand, scrub cloths, cleaning cloths, and similar articles. It is a good practice to check up on cleaning materials, such as oils, polishes, fine powders, coarse powders, stain and grease removers. Hand lotion should be considered as an essential part of one's housecleaning supplies, and should be kept near the kitchen sink. Keep handy such items as hair pins, a brush and comb, etc. It is surprising what a little freshening will do in the middle of the day when one is feeling very tired. A cool glass of lemonade or a piece af candy will revive the tired housekeeper. Comfortable shoes are a \"must have.\" One should have two pairs at least. The feet will feel like new if shoes are changed in the afternoon. Shoes with run-over heels should never be worn. They can quickly cause a backache. Dresses worn on housecleaning days ought to be suited to the job. They should be washable and simple, but bright. Even for the dirtiest work do not cover the dress with an old, torn 2. List some factors which will contribute toward making daily cleaning easier and less time-consuming; weekly cleaning; seasonal cleaning. Apron. Itis surprising the effect that clothes have on one's attitude toward the work in hand. Antiseptics and first-aid supplies are other necessary parts of housecleaning equipment. The rusty tack, the bent pin, the cracked glass may cause injuries which must be attended to immediately. And finally stop working before you get too tired. About four o'clock in the afternoon make yourself stop working. 3. What will a well-balanced cleaning program include? References America's Housekeeping Book, Sec. II, p.

Bulletins and pamphlets are not distributed by any state agricultural college to persons living outside the state. 'Therefore class leaders desiring such material should make requests of the Extension Service of the agricultural college of the state in which they live. Current household magazines and daily newspapers -_-  The Bible as Literature Lesson 5Bible Wisdom Tuesday, February 15, 1944 a PVisdom literature rises to its highest forms in the Bible. This is not to say that other literatures are lacking in wise sayings; there are essays and other forms that are fraught with wisdom. It is rather to emphasize the fact that within the Bible this type of literature receives distinctive attention. Hebrew wisdom is presented not alone in a book of unforgettable proverbs, but in essays of charming style and profound philosophy: it is also portrayed in the drama of Job that has challenged attention through the ages. Another thing that gives the wisdom literature of the Bible first place is its spiritual quality. Something of \"Thus saith the Lord\" seems to ring through many of the proverbs, even those designed to impress practical lessons of life. This quality is hardly characteristic of similar sayings taken from folklore of other peoples. For illustration, take a few of these folk sayings: \"A stitch in times saves nine.\" \"Handsome is as handsome does.\" \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\" \"A penny saved is a penny earned.\" All of these are helpful LESSON DEPARTMENT 703 704 bits of wisdom, but they come with less force than proverbs from the Bible, such as the following: Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging. A wise son maketh a glad father: But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise. My son, forget not my law; But let thine heart keep my commandments: For length of days and long life, And peace shall they add to thee. A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: But the soul of the treacherous shall eat violence. Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, Than an house full of sacrifices with strife. Apply thine heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge. Not all the sayings to be found in Proverbs are of the cast and spirit as those just given. Some of them simply portray. Facts of life impressively: Faithful are the wounds of a friend: But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. As cold waters To a thirsty soul, So is good news from a far country. Note the timelessness of the two proverbs just given. How these thoughts find echo today in the hearts of those stirred by the world conflict. This is characteristic of all the Biblical proverbs. 'They express truth for all time. Some of the Proverbs contain touches of subtle humor. For example: As the door turneth upon its hinges - So doth the sluggard upon his bed. There be three things which are stately in their march, Yea, four which are stately in going: The lion, Which is mightiest among beasts, And turneth not away for any; The greyhound; The he-goat also; And the king when his army is with him. Observe that some of these bits of Hebrew wisdom are cast in the form of Hebraic verse. There is a parallel structure, fitting to drive home the ideas expressed. Note also that the parallel structure is varied; sometimes it is of just two lines. At other times, as in the last example given, it is made up of several lines of differing lengths. Another thing that will be discovered by a reading of the Proverbs is the variety of subjects dealt with. At one time the writer discovered more than a score of these wise sayings expressive of the basic thought that to hold the tongue is a mark of wisdom. The sluggard, the busybody, the drunkard, the forward woman, the glutton, the spendthriftall are given scathing reproof. 'Those who fear the Lord, who honor their father and mother, who remember the needy, who deal justly are given praise with promise of reward for righteousness. And the application of each and every truth expressed with concreteness and force is in the living present. Among the apocryphal* books of the Bible is one entitled The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. This book, like others of the Apocrypha, was not included by the early Christian fathers as scripture, though it was recommended as worthy reading. It is said that Lord Bacon found his inspiration for his splendid essays in the writings of the Son of *See note at end of lesson. LESSON DEPARTMENT Sirach. From the example that follows one can rather readily see similarity in form, at least, with that of the well-known essayist of later days: FRIENDSHIP Sweet words will multiply a man's friends; and a fair speaking tongue will multiply courtesies. Let those that are at peace with thee be many; but thy counsellors one of a thousand. If thou wouldest get thee a friend, get him by proving, and be not in haste to trust him. For there is a friend that is so for his own occasion, and he will not continue in the day of thy affliction. And there is a friend that turnest to enmity; and he will discover strife to thy reproach. And there is a friend that is thy companion at the table; and he will not continue in the day of thy affliction; and in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants; if thou shalt be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face. Separate thyself from thine enemies; and beware of thy friends. A faithful friend is a strong defense; and he that hath found him hath found a treasure. There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend; and his excellency is beyond price. A faithful friend is a medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him. He that feareth the Lord directeth his friendship aright; for as he is so is his neighbor also. (Moulton's, The Modern Reader's Bible, p. 962) Another of the books of wisdom one that is among the scriptural works of the Bible is Ecclesiastes. In this intriguing book, ascribed to Solomon, are gems of wisdom well set. It faces life with frankness, dealing with its varied activities, and reading lessons out of them. |; What would seem to be a note of pessimism, of defeat, comes in the opening sentence and essay All is Vanity. Solomon, the Preacher, confesses he has tried everything that might bring joy and satisfaction to man, gathering about him as king all 705 that his heart desired, yet finding these things vain, \"astriving after wind\" without profit. The book continues with choice philosophic comments. It sparkles throughout with sentences that have become classic, for example: To everything there is a season And a time to every purpose under the heaven. Better is a poor and a wise child Than an old and foolish king. He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver. A good name is better than precious ointment. Cast thy bread upon the waters And thou shalt find it after many days. A search through Ecclesiastes will probably reveal many sayings which have been treasured through life. Within the book are also a number of choice poems. One of these near its close is a lyric of rare beauty. It begins: Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth: While the evil days come not, Nor the years draw nigh, When thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; And closes: Then shall the dust return to the earth, As it was: And the spirit shall return unto God Who gave it. After this poetic expression comes the epilogue, which ends with this uplifting paragraph: Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his 706 commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil. Suggestions for Discussion and Activities 1.

What \"America\" Means Lesson II-Our American Culture Tuesday, February 22, 1944 ULTURE is a word that cannot be defined by some conventional phrase. It is a condition and way of life which grows out of the spiritual influences and forces that are conducive of the higher life of mankind. When we speak of the culture of a people, we think of their sculpture, painting, architecture, music, literature, and the way they liveand think as a result of their high idealism. Culture grows out of religion, for it is religion that establishes and sustains fellowship with the divine spirit. A cultured man or a cultured society is a cumulative inward growth, expressing itself in fine thinking and noble activity. It is a LESSON DEPARTMENT cleanliness of heart and spirit, thoughtfulness of others, good manners, an appreciation of beauty. America has from the first developed those institutions that are conducive of culture. From the beginning of settlement to the present, American churches in their daily ministrations have always made a silent but constant and powerful contribution to national well-being and prosperity. Their services keep before the people the highest ideals of manhood and womanhood. 'The church with its Holy Bible is the chief inspiration of the vast social service rendered to the world by the millions of Christians. 'The world is after all governed more by public opinion than by, the written law, and if the ideals of the public are properly molded, then a fine cultured people grows as a result. It has been said that culture is the perfection of our human nature on all its sides, in all its capacities. Culture considers the spiritual capacities and needs of man. Matthew Arnold, the English writer, holds that the aim of culture coincides with the aim of religion. Culture aims at the perfection of the human mind and spirit and body. To know the culture of a people or of a person, one must consider their ways of life, their habits, their manners, the very tones of their voice; observe the literature they read, the things that give them pleasure, the words which come from their mouths, the thoughts which make the furniture of their minds. A true culture consists in men forgetting their hopes as centered on the outward and material things of life, and keeping in mind the inward and 707 spiritual setting. All the wise of the earth have cried out against the material ideals of humanity: the philosophers and moralists, the satirists of Greece and RomePlato, Epicttetus, Seneca, and Juvenal, not less than the Hebrew prophets and Christian apostles, up to that divine Voice that said: \"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" \"Nothing shows the culture and idealism of a people more forcibly than does the theater and the writers who make of the playhouse a place of beauty and a stimulus of expression of the highest poetic power,\" says Professor Brander Matthews. It is to the theater as an institution that the reader's mind is directed at this point. Since the days of the Greek theater when the plays of Sophocles and Aeschylus were produced somewhat as the plays of Shakespeare are produced today, the theater has been one of the great creations of culture; in turn, the stage has created a culture among all people. The art of the stage has given the public an understanding of literature and the manners of people as has no other art. The rise, progress, and cultivation of the drama mark the progress of refinement and the culture of any people. 'The drama and tragedy have brought about the. Building of the noble 'theaters of Europe and America and all civilized countries. Who has not heard of Drury Lane Theater in London and Covent Garden? The Royal Opera House of Berlin and the old City of St. Petersburg. And the National Theater of Paris will ever be remembered as the great centers of the 708: historic art. The first company to come to America to create the art of the stage came in 1751, when one William Hallam was induced to send a group of players to Virginia. The company landed at Yorktown in Virginia and then went on to Williamsburg, the capital of the colony, and Governor Dinwiddie gave them permission to build a theater and produce the first play in AmericaThe Merchant of Venice. Thus, Shakespeare had the first place in time, as in merit, as the dramatist of the western world. Soon after, September 17, 1753, the first theater was opened in New York City when a company from London produced a comedy called The Conscious Lover. On the night of November 20, the following note appeared on the playbills: N. B.Gentlemen and Ladies who intend to favor us with their company are desired to come by six o'clock, we being determined to keep to our hour; as it would be a great inconvenience to them to be kept out late. In March 1754, a company played the tragedy known as The Fair Penitent in Philadelphia. The players had success and \"gained money and reputation,\" notwithstanding that pamphlets were published and distributed warning the people of the evils of plays, players, and_playhouses. During the American Revolution, the Theater Royal in New York was the popular playhouse, and on Monday evening, January 16, 1786, Mr. Lewis Hallam played Hamlet, the first production of this immortal masterpiece in America. It is interesting to note that during the period of the Revolution, the theater was encouraged not only because it was conducive of morals and an appreciation of fine literature, but money was raised for the benefit of the \"poor soldiers and their dependent families.\"\" Robert Morris, one of the ablest statesmen and financiers of the Revolution, said: As to the effect of the theater on manners and morals, I hold it to be favourable to both.\" And yet, when a bill was introduced in the Pennsylvania Legislature for the suppression of the theater, a member thought that by drawing the minds of the people to amusements they were led to forget their political duties. He avowed himself \"as no friend of the fine arts,\" and asserted that they \"only flourished when states were on the decline.\" In the steady growth of the American theater, the drama has been held on a very high plane. The large and beautiful theaters of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, New Orleans, with those of San Francisco and, last, but not least, Salt Lake City have been conducive of a noble culture. America has produced some of the greatest actors of all time, and the glory of the American stage has been made by such actors as Edwin Forrest, Edwin Booth, Lawrence Barrett, E. H. Sothern, Otis Skinner, Charlotte Cushman, Maude Adams, and a host of other great artists. Interesting it is to note what Mr. M. B. Leavitt, the great American critic, once wrote about the old Salt Lake Theater: I appreciate the task of writing a chapter on Salt Lake City with all respect and admiration that dignity, intelligence, honesty, and artistic instinct always command. Sweeping as the statement may seem, I do not believe that the theater has ever rested LESSON DEPARTMENT upon a higher plane both as to its purpose and its offerings than that at Salt Lake City. Literature has been another factor in expressing and giving us a national culture. Every section of the country has had its literature, and what Van Wyck Brooks wrote about New England in his celebrated book, called The Flowering of New England is applicable to all America. \"All over New England,\" said he, \"not only in the 'Literary Emporium' as Boston was called far and wide, there was a passionate interest in self-culture.... Sons and daughters of the well-to-do were sent to the literary institutions, the colleges, and academies. Children of the poorer families, who could not afford to buy paper and ink, made their own or used chalk or charcoal, and learned to write on the kitchen floor; and some groups of boys and girls who had read Irving's 'Salmagundi,' edited a family magazine. Throughout the region, as throughout the nation, there was a widely spread presentiment that a great native American literature was about to make its appearance.\" Mr. Van Wyck's two volumes on New England literature is itself a great work, and if the reader of this lesson is able to obtain a copy he will find many chapters that will greatly interest him. Particularly is this true of the author's description of Longfellow, Holmes, Whittier, Bryant, Parkman, and the large number of other famous souls who have given us our national literature. In the South we have had among the many writers: Mark Twain, Thomas Nelson Page, Sidney Lanier, Booker T. Washington, Opie Read, and many others. The West has given us Bret Harte, Joa- 709 quin Miller, Willa Cather, John G. Neihardt, Hamlin Garland, and Edwin Markham. This list is only suggestive of hundreds of writers who have contributed to our national literature. Today, America has a greater love for literature than ever before. The Boston Herald has recently conducted a Book Fair at the Symphony Hall in Boston, where thousands of people heard the most distinguished authors of the day. The people of America have developed a deep love for music. From the time when the English, the French, and the Spanish came to this country to settle, they sang their native songs, and it was not long before they discovered the music of the American Indians. Musical instruments were brought from the Old World, and during the seventeenth century, harpsichords, the forerunner of the modern piano, were in the homes of the wealthy people. Through the music of the different nationalities, America has emotional and intllectual ties with most of the world. When a notable anniversary of some great composer comes, Americans find themselves celebrating it as a milestone in their cultural development. Mr. Henry Wilder Foote has written the history of church singing in America, describing the psalm singing of early New England as well as the old meetinghouse songs that were sung by the congregations. The first organ brought to America from' England was placed in King's Chapel in Boston in 1713. Since the American Revolution, the larger cities have become musical centers, and the Berkshire Symphonic Festival of the Boston Symphony orchestra, conducted by Dr. Sergei Koussevitsky is destined to become an influential force in every way, and comparable to the best traditions of Europe. From the beginning of America's pioneer movement to the West, songs have been sung and the music of the melodeon, the flute, and the violin have laid the foundation of the rich American music of today. Today, practically every large city has its own symphonic orchestra. Free park concerts are given in Chicago for six nights each week throughout the three summer months. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Opera Orchestra, and great bands appear. Great singers and instrumentalists appear with these organizations. Thousands of people attend these concerts. Band concerts are given in various larger cities with the admission price very nominal. Civic operas are also sponsored.\nAmerica has given to the world great sculptors and painters. The list includes Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Daniel Chester French, Solon Hannibal Borglum, John Quincy Adams Ward, George Grey Barnard, Mahonri Young, Cyrus E. Dallin, Avard Fairbanks, and many others, some of whom lived in the days of the American Revolution when Gilbert Stuart and John Singleton Copley painted the portraits of the founders of our Government. Interesting it is to note that the list contains Utah artists, who have gained renown both in Europe and America.\nPainting, like sculpture and architecture, is the expression of an inner sense of beauty obtained from some object, or some spiritual creation of the soul. Painting like all the other fine arts indicates the aesthetic life of a people, and this is one of the characteristics of culture.\nThe greatest power for culture is the development of deep religious feeling. America was founded by religious groups, all of whom had high purposes and held to the great certainty that God lives and that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the World. America has always turned to God in days of trial and darkness. Washington, Lincoln, McKinley, Wilson, Roosevelt have all voiced their supreme faith in the Father and the Son, knowing that such faith meets every human need. Out of the faith of America has come our art, our church buildings, our colleges, and universities all of which have led man to beauty and truth, to culture and refinement. We have our art galleries, symphonies, theaters, newspapers, magazines, and museums. Every city of America has its own public library, its churches, and public schools.\nAmong the works of man, there is no more perfect evidence of humanity's capacity to subdue matter and master the ever-present forces of nature than a nobly planned building, where God may be worshipped. A temple or cathedral shows the oneness of human nature, and throughout the ages the human constants,  hunger and labor, seed-time and harvest, love and death, faith and doubt have operated to produce the sacred shrines where God may be worshipped. Every American has one beautiful idea when he thinks of a church or cathedral:\nO God, in every temple, I see people that see Thee; And in every language I hear, they praise Thee.\nQuestions and Topics for Discussion\n1.

From one comes light; from the other darkness. This being so, mortal man has always found himself between the cross-fire of these two influences. He is free, however, to make his own choice as to which way he would direct his life, whether to seek righteousness and the will of the Lord, or whether to follow selfish desires and become subject to the powers of evil. The outcome of this personal struggle when multiplied into families, tribes or nations sets in motion a spiral of hate that often is not stopped short of bloodshed and destruction.\nThe story of two ancient and great nations of people in America which sprang from one common ancestor has within its history this struggle between good and evil. From the beginning account of Lehi's family, when this prophet was first commanded to lead his family out of the doomed city of Jerusalem, there were seeds of discord present in the family group. Laman and Lemuel, the older sons, early manifested a hardness of heart toward the things of God. At times these brothers did repent and found themselves once again in the narrow way, but never did this repentant mood persist long enough to give goodness the upper hand in their souls.\nThe result was that with the passing of Lehi in the promised land came the contention for leadership of the little colony. Nephi, the youngest of the brothers born in Jerusalem, became, by divine appointment, the leader of his brethrenand this because of his choice of the good and his zeal in obeying the will of the Lord. Laman and Lemuel would not accept Nephi's leadership. Neither would they humble themselves to inquire of the Lord as to Nephi's appointment as prophet, feeling that if God had placed their younger brother over them it was unjust. This feeling grew to a point of such intense hatred that the Lord warned Nephi of his brothers' intent upon his life. They sought to kill him.\nA separation of the little colony became the only solution to prevent bloodshed and further animosity. Nephi relates this parting of the family ties as follows:\n\"Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my God, because of the anger of my brethren. But behold, their anger did increase against me; insomuch that they did seek to take away my life. Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinks to rule over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are the elder brethren, to rule over this people.\nNow I do not write upon these plates all the words which they murmured against me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they did seek to take away my life.\nAnd it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi, should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those who would go with me.\nWherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all those who would go with me were those who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words.\nAnd we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we did pitch our tents.\nAnd my people would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi. And all those who were with me did take upon them to call themselves the people of Nephi\" (II Nephi 5:1-9).\nThe full result of this unfortunate disagreement in the land of promise was not to be realized immediately. With the passing of years came bitter fruits which must always attend those who are disobedient to the will of God and who fail to repent. Laman and Lemuel and those who remained with these two elder sons of Lehi became known as the Lamanites. Darkness took possession of them. Their desires for peace, industry and the arts died. In place of these traits of culture came the wish for blood, slothfulness and idolatry. They became skilled warriors apt in the art of cunning and the insidious use of weapons, such as the bow, the ax, and the cimeter. The use of this last named, a saber in kind, indicates the sly treacherous nature which had crept into their souls. Its point hooks upward, making a thrust from a crouching position more effective.\nEnos, a prophet who lived about 179 years after Lehi left Jerusalem, and who had seen wars between the Lamanites and the followers of Nephi (called then the Nephites), describes the sorrowful state into which the Lamanites had fallen in these words:\n\"And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our labors were in vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a bloodthirsty people; full of idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us\" (Enos 20).\nWith no record to inform them of the will of God, the Lamanites soon lost the desire to worship. They were cut off from the presence of the Lord. And with their failure to recognize Nephi as their rightful leader they lost the priesthood, which is the right to act upon earth in the name of the Lord. To further add to their misery the Lord cursed them with a dark skin in order to make them unattractive to the people of Nephi.\nOur lesson this week gives little in the way of upliftits objective being to show that wrongdoing and disobedience to God's will bring evil results. From it, however, and from the study of the Lamanites comes a very significant fact for one who questions the value of the record of God's word to His children. Blind and ignorant though these Lamanites had become, still they felt that the power their enemies, the Nephites, had over them was due, in part at least, to records Nephi had preserved for his people. In such an understanding rests a hope for the future return to light of this benighted race.\nNote the significance of this verse of Enos the prophet:\n\"For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring them (the Lamanites) to the true faith. And they swore in their wrath that, if it were possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also all the traditions of our fathers\" (Enos 14).\nQuestions for Active Reading and Discussion.\nWith the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the passage given to discover plain and precious truths of the Gospel brought to light in the Book of Mormon. If time permits, have each member of the class add a passage of his own selection from within the Book of Mormon (II Nephi, Chapters 4 and 5, and Enos)  a passage that has brought new meaning to a Gospel truth:\n1. What was the punishment that came upon the Lamanites for their evil doing? Read II Nephi 5:19-26.\n2. What is the hope for the Lamanites as found in the blessing of Lehi? Read II Nephi 4:6-9.\nThe next question may be used if needed for class activity, or it may be assigned for home study.\n3. How may one forgiven of sins respond to the Lord?

            "content": "President Heber J. Grant Reaches Another Milestone President Amy Brown Lyman HE General Board of Relief Society, in behalf of the 115,000 members of the organization, extends greetings and good wishes to our beloved and revered president, Heber J. Grant, on his 87th birthday, on November 22. We love and honor President Grant not only for his many accomplishments and successful life and for his great service to his Church and to humanity in general, but we love and honor him also for the excellence of his personal character, for his faith in God and for his devotion _ to the Gospel of the Master, for his wise and forceful teachings and for his splendid example. Here is a man who practices what he preaches and preaches what he practices. One of the distinguishing characteristics of his personal life which especially appeals to women and which we desire especially to mention, has been his devotion to his mother during her lifetime and to her memory since her passing. He has been PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT outstanding in this respect in an age when ingratitude of children to parents is sometimes encountered. Page 653 654 The only child of his mother and left fatherless when but nine days old, little Heber Grant early manifested a devotion to her which is rare in young children and which is sometimes absent in grownup children. This appreciation of his mother and her ability, and the understanding of her problems and her responsibilities and of her confidence in him, encouraged him in his determination, even when young, to try to take the place of his father in looking after and providing for her. He always remembers with pride her refusal to have the bishop of the ward reshingle her house for her. She was able by the work of her own hand, she said, to have the leaks in the roof patched up, which repair work would last until her own son could build a new house for her.. HIS appreciation and understanding of her motherly virtues has no doubt also influenced his attitude toward the women of his own family and the women of the Church and their work, which has always been one of appreciation and chivalry. Indeed he has ever been a champion in the interest of mothers and of women in general. For the beautiful life they lived together, this widow and son, President Grant gives all praise to his mother. His tributes to her are convincing, beautiful, and touching. But whatever his training, this loved son was by nature kind, tender, and obedient, and he was blessed of the Lord with those qualities which have made him the great and good man that he is. Two people rarely live a life together so full of mutual harmony, respect, and pure love for each other as did that pioneer widow, that devoted Latter-day Saint, Rachel Ridgway Grant, and her pure-hearted, unselfish, charitable, and now distinguished son, President Heber J. Grant. She loved him with the greatest devotion and admiration. But her love and devotion to him did not exceed in the slightest degree his devotion, admiration, and love for her. Eloquent as President Grant is when preaching the Gospel that he loves as much as he loves his own life, yet he is not more eloquent then, nor when speaking upon any other subject, than when referring to the goodness, the gentleness, the faith, devotion, and self-sacrifice for the Gospel of his good and saintly mother. Hers was truly an angelic nature. But great and good as was her nature, it did not exceed the goodness, the kindness, the tenderness, the charity, the efficiency, and the understanding of her distinguished son. FOLLOWING are some very lnteresting excerpts from letters to President Grant written by his mother while he was in Japan and Europe: October 12, 1901 I am much happier that you are where you are and where the Lord wishes you to be that in going in debt and trying to get rich. My motto is, \"Seek first the Kingdom of God, and all things will be added that will be for our good. I fully appreciate the love and gratitude you feel in regard to my teaching I gave you. I often live my life over in thinking how happy I was when we used to sit and sing and talk and measure tape. There would not be so many bad boys and girls if mothers would think more and teach their children the Gospel than thinking so much about their dress. I love to see children look nice and make home pleasant. I always enjoyed your bringing the boys home more than having you go away. October 19, 1901 I am pleased you are studying the scriptures. I used to talk to you and wish you to read them and get ready for a mission. I feel the experience you have had will do you good and you will find more joy and comfort in laboring to bring people to a knowledge of the true and living God than all of the riches this world could afford. _ November 17, 1904 Well, my dear boy, you will soon be forty years of age. You used to say that you thought you would not live to be older than your father was. I am truly thankful you have lived so long and wish you very many years yet and filled with usefulness. I feel I have been blessed above many mothers, to have so good a son, and live to see my wishes and prayers granted that you might live to be a faithful worker in the Kingdom of God. I felt the great responsibility resting upon me as you had no father, for the way I brought you up. November 22, 1906 I intended to write you a letter for your birthday to arrive on that day, but the time passes so fast, I thought I would write on the birthday. You have been in my mind and I have been with you in spirit, if not in person. I have been thinking of you all the day and how much we all have to be thankful for as a family and as a people. If we were all as united as we should be and lived our religion, enjoying the spirit of the Gospel the adversary would not have the power he has. I appreciate all the love and your wish to do all you can to make my last days happy. I wish all mothers had as good a son as I have."

            "content": "They Were Called Pilgrims Vesta Crawford O many of us Thanksgiving means a feast, a time of rejoicing for the fruits of the land. This year, particularly, Thanksgiving should mean a spiritual feast as well, a reckoning with that \"plenty\" which is not dependent upon the harvesting of fields. We have thought of the first Thanksgiving as the celebration in 1621 when the Pilgrims prepared a feast in the wilderness. That day was associated with reaping, the gathering of crops, the storage of food for winter. It was a day of appreciation for the good things of the earth. Yet there was a deeper meaning, a memory of a previous year when there was no material thing to harvest. The very first Thanksgiving Day was not a festival it was not an autumn holiday. In December, 1620, when the Pilgrims first set foot on the shore of the New World, deep winter lay upon the land and the forest looked dark and foreboding. There was a storm at sea and a strong wind shook the stubble of Indian corn that leaned up against the hills. We might try to voice the thoughts and feelings of these wanderers who faced the winter in an alien land. The words of the English poet, Felicia Hemans, have caught the spirit of that time and place and have given us a picture that can never be forgotten: The breaking waves dashed high On a stern and rock-bound coast And the woods against a stony sky Their giant branches tossed.. And the heavy night hung dark The hills and water o'er When a band of exiles moored their bark On the wild New England shore.... The pioneer, the pilgrim; has always been faced with loneliness and hardship. We can realize this because Our direct ancestors, too, made sacrifices for religious freedom and for the opportunity to develop their own social ideals. 'There is a striking parallel that links the story of the Pilgrims with the pioneer history of our own people. There is much more to the word pilgrim than we may have realized. The direct source of the name comes from the Bible. In that Epistle wherein Paul, the Apostle, speaks to the Hebrews, it is written in the eleventh chapter: \"By faith he (Abraham) sojourned in the land of promise, as in a. Strange country.... For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Through faith also Sara herself received strength.... These all died in faith... And confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth... They desire a better country.\" The New England Pilgrims, also, followed the pattern explained in the Bible, for \"They sojourned in the land of promise.\" They set about to build homes in the wilderness \"westward.\" There, on the edge of an unknown land, they were thankful for simple things, for the Page 661 662 earth and the streams of water, for the trees and for the light of the evening fires. \"THERE is a true and graphic account of this first Thanksgiving Day written by a man who was there, Governor William Bradford. Even in the midst of the exacting demands of pioneer life, the great governor could not forget his heritage and the heritage of his people. He remembered the departure from Leyden in. The land of Holland: \"So they left ye goodly and pleasante citie, which had been their resting place for near twelve years, but they knew that they were Pilgrims and looked not much ons those things but lifted up their eyes to ye heavens their dearest countrie and quieted their spirits.\" The long journey across the stormy Atlantic was a brave pilgrimage to a land the wanderers had never seen. Today when distance is a small thing, we cannot fully. Appreciate the loneliness of that one small ship adrift so far from home. It is difficult, even, for us to realize the loneliness of a covered wagon on the western prairies. Perhaps we have gone too far away from a time when thankfulness was an everyday rejoicing of the spirit. Governor Bradford called the Mayflower \"ye dauntless ship,\" and he writes in detail of the arrival in the dark days of early winter. He voices relief that the sea was conquered and an abiding place had been found at last: \"Being thus artived in good harbor and brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed ye God of heaven, who had brought them over ye vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all ye perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on ye firm and stable earth, their proper elemente.\" The Pilgrims, like all pioneers, could not forget what they had left behind. The brightness and the hope of the future were not strong enough to dull the memory of home. Even on their first Thanksgiving Day, they remembered Southampton where the Mayflower came to gather up the Holland Pilgrims; they remembered Plymouth, in England, where they had looked their last upon their native land. Realizing this, Bradford expressed the solitude they felt in that small strip of land between the forest and the sea: \"They had no friends to wellcome them, nor inns to entertain or refresh their weatherbeaten bodies, nor houses or much less towns to repair to, to seek for succoure.\" There was ice on the streams. There was no green plant nor red flower, no blade of grass nor grain. The earth was an etching of gray and brown tree trunks and white hill slopes. \"And for ye season it was winter, and ye know ye winters of ye countrie, know them to be sharp and violent, and subject to cruelle and fierce storms, dangerous to travel to known places, and more to search an unknown coast. Besides what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full of willd beasts and willd men, and what multitudes there might be of them they knew not.... For summer being done all things stand upon them with a weatherbeaten face, and ye whole countrie, full of woods and thickets, represented a willd and savage hiew.\" THEY WERE CALLED PILGRIMS GUCH was the New England shore on that day when the cornerstone of a nation was laid in the strength of religious freedom. There was much to be thankful for, an appreciation and a memory that should extend to us every day and every year. Governor Bradford earnestly expresses a universal thought: \"Our fathers came over this great ocean, and were ready to perish in the wilderness; but they cried unto ye Lord, and he heard their voice.... Let them therefore praise ye Lord because he is good-and his mercies endure forever.\" It is recorded that on the first 663 Thanksgiving Day there was singing. Again, the words of Felicia Hemans tell in rhythmic measures the story that Bradford wrote in simple prose:  Amidst the storm they sang And the stars heard, and the sea, And the sounding aisles of: the dim woods rang To the anthem of the free.... Is there not a parallel in this with the singing of the western pioneers of a later day? With their wagons circled around them, they, too, sang their pilgrim songs in the wilderness: Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear...."

            "content": "Moral and Religious Integrity Elder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union rity, these Jesus called the weightier matters of the law. They are fundamental virtues in both civic and religious life. The Latter-day Saints in pioneer days acquired wide reputation for business integrity. To be identified with the Church was better security than stocks and bonds. Some current bankers' codes of ethics state that a borrower's character is more important than his collateral security. Probably most business men would agree to this in principle, if not in practice. We may well ask ourselves, is membership in the Church now a guarantee of business integrity? Unfortunately, it is not always so; even court records reveal some damaging evidence. The craze to get rich quick and by easy rather than by earned methods is largely responsible for this slump from industry and honesty. The desire to excel in making a show of luxury and fashion is also an important cause of dishonest practices leading to misappropriation of institutional and public funds or to inexcusable bankruptcy. \"Plain living and high thinking\" supported by industry, physical or mental or both, is the most certain method of forestalling these departures from the standard of integrity properly expected of all Latter-day Saints. This, however, is only one phase of integrity. Other phases are of no Page 664 less importance. Integrity applies also to fulfillment of all one's moral and religious obligations, living up to one's professions. A Latter-day Saint presumably has accepted the Restored Gospel with all its standards of individual and social living. There are those who pride themselves on strict conformity to outward observance of some of these standards, involving practices that may be seen of men, or shown on the Church records, and assume by this that they are thorough Latter-day Saints. How do they stand on the first and second great commandments? 'They may think they stand very well on the first, but what conception have they of the spiritual qualities of God? Do they give any thought to this question? If so, is He conceived in terms of their own human weaknesses, as do many primitive peoples, or do they attribute to Him the highest virtues of which man can conceive and much beyond? Does their professed love of God include love of these virtues, and sincere effort to realize them in their own lives? \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" Unless love of God results in striving to realize this ideal, it is but a pretense and a very wide departure from the principle of integrity. As professed religion it is in the same class as that manifested by some of the scribes and Pharisees so severely denounced by Jesus as hypocrites MORAL AND RELIGIOUS INTEGRITY and worse than ordinary sinners. The sin of hypocrisy is the antithesis of religion. Without sincerity profession of religion is a mockery, and worse than making no profession of religion at all. What of the second great commandment? Do the Pharisees of our time really love their fellowmen as they love themselves, or do they seek first and foremost their own advantage with little concern for the welfare of their fellows? When confronted with the suffering of fellowmen do they seek in all sincerity and diligence to relieve this suffering, or do they wrap about them their cloak of assumed righteousness and \"pass by on the other side\" as did the priest and the Levite in the story of the good Samaritan? In the history of religions it often happens that the initial enthusiasm under the leadership of a great proph- 665 et tends to slump, and the adherents of a religion forget the great ideals and purposes of their religion. 'They either ignore these ideals and set about enriching themselves and impoverishing other people, as did some of the rulers of ancient Israel and Judah, or they do as did the scribes and Pharisees, concentrate on outward observance of some of the details of the law, confusing means with ends, replacing spiritual attitudes and motives with mere outward conformity, and forgetting altogether the greater commandments upon which all others are founded. Jesus said \"... Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees...\" We may well say to ourselves, \"Beware lest we seek to rise by this same kind of leaven.\" There is danger that it may leaven the whole lump. Let us maintain our religious integrity. _RADIO SERIES Commencing Sunday, October 10, Elder Aloert E. Bowen of the Council of the Twelve began a new series of radio talks entitled: \"Constancy in a Changing World\" over the Church Sunday Evening HourKSL, 9:15 p.m. We think that this series will be of such general interest, and of such value to members of the Church, that Relief Society members are encouraged to listen wherever they are in a position to do so."

            "content": "Pioneer Life in Old Mexico Florence Ivins Hyde IONEER life in Old Mexico is one of the unique stories of Mormon historythe story of a small group, loyal to their family ties, fleeing from persecution to a place of refuge. \"Refugees,\" they were called. It is not the usual story of pioneers trekking across great distances of desert land with the fear of death from Indians added to their other hardships, but rather one of making new homes in a strange land. The story of the Mormon colonies in Mexico is the story of the building of communities under difficult circumstances. The life of our family was typical of life in the colonies. I recall countless pleasures of those early daysI still feel the joy of long, hot afternoons spent by us children sitting on the limbs of trees eating juicy peaches, or under a_ grapevine quenching our thirst with the watery grapes; watching the birds carry sticks and strings to build their nests, or industrious ants carry tiny bits of food down into a hole in the ground for a winter store. I recall, too, the fun of eating parched corn, strips of dried venison which my father sizzled over the coals; and the unique experience of learning how to catch fleas so that we might be able to sleep. All these childhood experiences were more interesting than the winters spent in school (at that time none too good), trying to learn Spanish. They were pleasures which we enjoyed as a matter of course, with Page 666 out understanding the sacrifices made by the original settlers to make even these few things possible. What to our parents was a tremendous sactifice, was to us children only a new adventure. Years before our immediate family was called as missionaries into Mexico, my grandfather, Erastus Snow, had been sent down from Utah to purchase land for the settlement of colonies by members of the Church. Soon after, in 1885, the first \"refugees,\" seventy in number, had crossed over the border from Snowflake, Arizona. These early pioneers suffered many of the hardships that accompany pioneer life. What they ate, they had to raise, and what they wore, they had to make. At first, they lived in tents, but as soon as possible they began to build permanent homes. In 1888, Erastus Snow had built for himself a two-story adobe house in Colonia Juarez at a cost of $1,400, \"to encourage others to build good houses.\" It is certain that the adults in these colonies would have preferred to have remained in their homes in the United States. Many of them had already pioneered in southern Utah and Arizona; but rather than give up their family ties they undertook this strange new life. TWELVE years after the first group went into Mexico, my father was called to preside over the Mexican Mission and to organize the Mexican Agricultural and Colonization PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO Company. He had already filled two missions to the interior of Mexico; but this time he was not to spend two years there, but he was told to take his family and prepare to make his home in Mexico. The sacrifice such a move entailed cannot be understood by one who has not experienced it. His future in the United States seemed to hold the. Greatest success for him. After receiving the call from the Presidency of the Church, he rode out to his ranch on the Kaibab mountain to talk it out, as was always his custom, with himself and his horse. The greatest sacrifice was not for himself but for his wife and children. To move them away from a state that offered them the advantages of education and culture, from their families and friends, to a land which had nothing to, offer, required the greatest of courage. His diary tells of men who advised \"I wouldn't go,\" but he and his wife decided there was nothing else for them to do. The family was to travel by train to the border but all of our \"belongings\" had to be taken overland. My father took over the border two mules and sixty horses (among which were two thoroughbred mares, Pearl Livingstone and Minnehaha), and old Jimmy, a horse which had grown up with our family and was now too old to be of any service, but. Also too old to be left behind. A little later he brought over a setting of white Wyandotte eggs, the first hatching to come to the colony. Our first impression of our new home came as we awoke in the morning in a hotel at the border and heard the clatter of horses' hoofs on the cobblestone street, the rattle of ROAD INTO THE MOUNTAIN COLONIES the milk wagons as they passed by, and the call of the Mexican boys, \"Aqui viene la leche!\" (\"Here comes the milk.\"). Here, at the border, we met the wagons which had come overland in which we were to make the remainder of the journey. That short trip of about 100 miles over the desert into Colonia Juarez can never be forgotten. We cooked our meals over a campfire and ate them sitting on blankets on the ground or on the wagon seats. At night our parents made beds on the ground under the stars, where we were lulled to sleep by the tinkle of the cowbells as the - animals hobbled around to find feed. We were to experience many such nights during our life in Mexico, nights spent in the tops of the mountains where we heard the cry of a lone wolf, or in the narrow box canyons where the call of the hoot owl 668 echoed up and down the walls. Mexican skies are filled with twinkling stars and a moon which seems to shine brighter than in any other place in the world, and which gives one a feeling for the beauty that led the psalmist to sing, \"When I... Meditate on thee in the night watches.\" Colonia Juarez, which was to be our home, was situated in a picturesque spot in the bend of the Piedres Verdes River. Here we occupied the house built years before by Grandfather Snow. By adding three rooms and a lean-to it made a comfortable home for our family of eleven until we built our new home, supplied with running water, a built-in sink, and other conveniences which seemed to us like the acme of luxuly. Seldom a week passed without our entertaining \"company\" of some sort. We boarded the school teacher from the North; we entertained Mexican officials who came on business; we \"kept\" the Church officials who came for conferences. All of these visitors made it necessary for us children to be continuously on our best behavior. During those years our parents had to become accustomed to depending upon themselves. They nursed us through epidemics of measles and other childhood diseases without a doctor and with no medicine except home remedies. Many times it was necessary for mother to be left alone. With a sick child, but before leaving, father always put his hands upon the sick child's head and prayed for him. The members of the colonies also helped one another. If one mother had not enough food for her nursing baby, some other mother was found who would nurse the child and save its life. But occasionally, tragedies came, just as they are bound to come in any community. My father writes in his diary of a day when the corpses of two children and one man lay in the little town at the same time. All had died of what they called pneumonia. Up to the time we went to Juarez, there had never been a doctor in any of the colonies. A midwife delivered the babies with the usual degree of success. In case of accidents and diseases, the people had to depend on themselves. It is a miracle that so many recovered; but as is always. True when people are left to themselves, there were more prayers offered, and more administrations to the sick. All sorts of home remedies were used also, some of which probably did no good, but no harm either. In the spring, children were fed molasses and sulphur, with no knowledge of the valuable vitamin in molasses. For some troubles plasters of cooked onions were applied alternating with plasters of freshly killed chicken flesh. Many deaths, however, must have occurred due to lack of medical care and _ professional nursing. At one time the town suffered from an epidemic of typhoid fever. My father made the trip to El Paso, Texas, to consult a physician. Following his instructions, my sister and I, for the twelve weeks we were sick, tasted nothing but boiled milk and an antiseptic called 'acetezone,\" which we drank by the gallon. Our parents acted as our nurses, mother during the day and father at night. Once when my mother was suffering PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO 669 THE IVINS HOME IN COLONIA JUAREZ from lumbago, our neighbor came each day and bathed us. Later when the daughter-in-law of this same neighbor was stricken with typhoid, a child was born to her prematurely. 'There was no such thing as an incubator, but the child was saved by being wrapped in cotton and being fed with a spoon. Each day during this time of sickness, my mother carried to this neighbor two quarts of boiled milk. It was experiences such as these which cemented the people together in the strongest bonds of friendship. We were necessary to each other and no matter what our difficulties, something always brought us through. LL sorts of problems present themselves in a new community titles to lands, taxes, duties on imports, and social problems such as schools and entertainments. Trips had to be made to Chihuahua to request the governor not to collect taxes from colonists who had not resided there ten years, and to have reduced other taxes which were unequally assessed and very burdensome. Water rights had to be settled; lands surveyed; arrangements had to be made in the different colonies for payment of pasturage by those who had no range land but had cattle grazing on colony land all practical but difficult problems to adjust. Later, land had to be sought out for the establishment of other colonies, eight in all. There were six colonies settled in Chihuahua: Diaz, Dublan, and Juarez, with three located in the mountains, Chuichupa, Pacheco, and Garcia; and two colonies in Sonora: Oaxaca and Morelos. Large amounts of land ex- PARTY OF GOVERNOR AHUMADA AT HOME OF PRESIDENT IVINS Front row left to right: Member of Governor's party, Henry Eyring, Governor Ahumanda, President Ivins, the Jefe Politico of Casas Grandes.

Isted but very little water. The settling of all these problems required the men to be away from home and to travel in what we called a \"buckboard,\" a vehicle none too comfortable. Most of these trips my father made alone. In his diary he speaks of one trip through \"country wild and broken, sparsely settled, where the people look like a lot of rogues.\" Once as he camped at night, finding himself without matches, he put cotton from a camp quilt into his gun and fired it to start his campfire. According to my mother's record, father was at home only six months of the first two years in Mexico! We were always controlled by the jefe politico at Casas Grandes, about five miles away. For some reason eo we were never permitted to establish a municipality at Juarez, which resulted in all civic problems being decided by the Priesthood. Before long it was decided to assess the people to build an irrigation canal. Men were hired to do the work at twentyfive cents per hour or fifty cents foi a man with a team. Most families depended upon the well water foi household purposes. Practically every family had its own garden and milked its own cows. A flour mill was built to grind the farmers' wheat, a molasses mill to take the syrup from the cane. We had two \"yeast women\" who would exchange homemade yeast for a cup of flour or half-a-cup of sugar. As a rule, however, each household was independent in itself. 670 \" PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO In the early days, the flour was very dark and the bread was heavy. Sugar was unrefined, about the color of our maple sugar, made in \"pelous,\" cone-shaped pieces about two feet high, just the shape of the crown of a Mexican sombrero. One job of us children was to pulverize this sugar by using father's pestle and mortar. Several years later, after my father had succeeded in having the duties reduced, we imported refined sugar and flour from \"the States.\" All the cooking was done on a wood-burning stove, the fires of which were started with chips gathered from the woodpile the night before by us children. Always on the back of the stove simmered a kettle of cracked wheat which made a perfect breakfast served with thick jersey cream and cream biscuits. For dinner, we had an abundance of crisp vegetables from our own garden, our own chickens or any meat that could be obtained at the time. Occasionally someone in the town killed a beef and we stood in line to get what we could. Wild meat could be obtained at any time of the year for there were no game laws, and always at Christmas time we had a wild turkey, if not killed by ourselves, then purchased from Mr. Stegal. I have no childhood recollection of tender, juicy beefsteaks, but plenty of tender venison. For supper at night, we had bread and milk, sometimes cornmeal mush, with plenty of fruit, molasses, and cheese. On our table was always a large pitcher of blue \"separated\" milk and a pitcher of thick yellow cream. We mixed our own milk according to the richness we desired. I long for those suppers again! 671 We made our own butter, more than we ate, and while it was plentiful mother \"put it down\" in fivegallon cans for the winter, when it was scarce. Butter to be \"put down\" must be worked over and over with a wooden ladle to separate all the milk, which would sour, from the fat, then stored in a cool under- - ground cellar. So far as I know, no fruit was ever preserved in glass jars, for in our town was a man who made tin cans. Our fresh fruit was preserved in quart cans and our preserves in five-gallon cans. These tin cans were made with a groove around the edge inside of which fitted a lid. To seal the can, melted resin was poured into the groove. When the can was opened, the resin, which was bitter, had to be chipped out with great care for if it got into the can the fruit would be bitter. We made our own candy from molasses and honey. After supper in the winter, we all sat together around the fireplace while father read to us stories of adventure of Stanley in Africa, of a carrier pigeon in the Spanish-American war, or else, together we worked puzzles and riddles from the Ladies' Home Journal. We had to supply our own entertaimment. Adult groups presented Othello, East Lynn, the opera Queen Esther, and other pretentious plays. I remember well the terror that gripped our young hearts as Othello plunged the dagger into the heart of the beautiful Desdemona; and we were touched emotionally when Oucen Esther sang with resignation, \"T will go unto the king, and if I perish, I perish.\" Our daytime entertainment was of a most wholesome typehorseback riding, basketball, baseball, croquet, gathering wild walnuts, or hunting or fishing in the mountains where deer, turkeys, and other wild animals abounded. Once while driving through the mountains we saw a fox running away with a turkey, and on another occasion we drove through a forest with a fire burning on each side of the road while brightly colored parakeets chattered like monkeys as we passed along. The road into these extremely rough mountains was in places steep and of solid rock, and we always lightened the load for the horses by walking up the dugways. Around Mound Valley could be woven the romance of an ancient city. It is supposed that each of the many mounds covers a ruin. Up one of the mountains is one large cave containing about eighty rooms which once served as a home, as is indicated by its ollas and broken pottery. It was in one of these rooms that we found, one day, on the hard plaster of the wall, the name, \"Erastus Snow,\" in grandfather's own handwriting. Near here, too, where my father prospected for ore were found, he says in his diary, \"sixteen rich veins of copper-bearing quartz, not feasible to mine because the country is almost inaccessible, even on horseback.\" Not far away is located what he named the \"Seven Star Mine,\" \"'tich in silver ore, and caves of beautiful stalagmites and stalactites.\" All through these mountains are most beautiful flowers and ferns and in some places dellicious mountain trout. On these trips, we children, as we grew to manhood and womanhood, learned some of the most valuable lessons of our lives: a love of nature, an appreciation of the great outdoors, a knowledge of the bigness of the universe, proper treatment of animals as well as of each other. It was here, when we once saw five deer drinking in the stream near us, that father, himself a great hunter, said, \"I could never shoot a deer if I could see its eyes.\" At another time when a guest we had taken with us began, on Sunday morning, to prepare his fishing tackle to go down to the stream, my father remarked casually, ''My hook never catches anything on Sunday.\" Our brothers spent much of their time in Mexico with their horses, the value of which can hardly be overestimated. Good manners in horses are just as important as good manners in men; both require long and constant training. An _ educated horse responds to the slightest move of its rider and struts and shows style according to his command. Nothing is more charming nor gives greater satisfaction than a well-trained horse, and unless it is his dog, a boy cannot have a finer friend. One of the most. Urgent needs of the colonies was a better school. A one-room building with a basement served as schoolhouse, meetinghouse, theater, and dance hall. It was this great need that led the people to assess themselves 8 per cent of their incomes to build the Juarez Stake Academy, which soon became an accredited school, its courses being accepted by colleges of the United States. The construction of better buildings had been made possible by having the duty lifted from such articles as nails and glass.  PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO 673 JUAREZ ACADEMY, COLONIA JUAREZ, CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO From the time the academy was built we had excellent teachers \"from the States,\" who trained numerous local teachers. No one who grew up in the Mexican colonies can ever forget the lasting influence of those two great teachers, Guy C. Wilson and Ella Larsen. Every six months my parents did their marketing in E] Paso, Texas. To us it was the hub of the universe. Hats, shoes, cloth for dresses, and household articles were all purchased to last six months. Our dental work had to be done there also. Around my memories of El Paso always hovers the memory of the unwelcome dentist's chair. Thunder storms and floods are among my most vivid recollections of Mexico. One can never forget the frightening claps of thunder nor the floods that came down the Piedres Verdes River. The rain there literally \"comes down in sheets.\" During the rainy season, which lasts all summer, a shower must be expected every day; but once in a while an unusually large cloud appears. One _ watches it grow larger and larger until it bursts, appearing to fall in one great bucketful. Soon up this river one hears a roaring sound which grows louder and louder until it reaches the town. It comes down the river bed like a great wall, carrying before it uprooted trees, barns, sometimes animals, and always in the old days before we built a permanent bridge, the extension bridge which swung across the river. In those days, if the flood came in the daytime, 'everyone ran to the banks of the river and watched. It meant that\" until the river went down no one from our side could get to the store, WRECKAGE FROM A FLOOD OF THE PIEDRES VERDES RIVER nor to meetings, and the only way we could get messages to those on the other side was to stand on the bank and call through our cupped hands. When the flood came at night, it had for us children a more sinister aspect, as if some great monster were on the rampage, which would leave the shores strewn with wreckage as the water subsided. LL these experiences in a strange country had their price in money, toil, and even the length of life itself. Iam certain our friends and relatives visiting the colonies felt sorry for us, as we sometimes did for ourselves, and saw little to compensate for such a life of exile. Destiny sometimes plays a remarkable part in the lives of people and as the years go by our experiences in Mexico become richer. In spite of the many advantages that we missed in our youth, we have felt the genuine happiness that only the simplicity of the outdoors can bring; we had the great advantage of growing up among people who were basically fine, people who found their great pleasure with friends, riding through the mountains, climbing the hills, and boating down the river in the bright moonlight. The friends we made in that faraway country are the friends of our youth. We can always count on. Them. When they suffer, we suffer and are always ready with sympathy. With them, we saw this small Mormon town grow into a town of good homes, electric lights, telephones, with many other of the modern conveniences. Sometimes we wonder where all the present confusion is leading us. We, as parents, have studied the sciences of psychology and sociology that we feel are so important today, but we still have before us the task of meeting our problems as well as our parents met theirs in early Mormon life. They were \"artists in the art of life,\" which someone has said is, after all, the end of all education."

Always high-principled and courageous, she also understands military and naval tactics, and foreign diplomats say they have never known any one with such a grasp of international affairs. Her own statesmanship is considered responsible for Holland's neutrality in the last war. Often she was better informed than her advising ministers and at once detected discrepancies or inaccuracies in their reports. She hopes for a just and Christian peace. May her voice be heard in peace negotiations! WOMEN who have added to our Indian lore are: Rita Green Thornton with her Indian opera Zunuiana; Jeanne L'Strange Cappel, descendant of the Chippewa tribe, with books on Indian legends; and Marion E. Gridley with Indian Legends of American Scenes. CORNELIA OTIS SKINNER'S delightful autobiographical story, Our Hearts Were Young and Gay has been among the season's best sellers and is to be filmed.

            "content": "Giving thanks THERE is always cause for thanksgiving in the hearts of devout Latter-day Saints although their lives may be cast in the midst of troubles, anxieties, sorrows, and dangers; for far outweighing such temporal conditions is the sure knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the Prophet Joseph Smith was the instrument in the hand of the Lord in restoring the great eternal plan of salvation to man. The conditions in which Latterday Saints find themselves throughout the world, while we in the United States observe this Thanksgiving season, will vary widely as to matetial comforts and assurance, but in the things of the spirit which giveth life and hope, all may be equally blessed. That same testimony which strengthens and upholds a Church member in Zion or any of her stakes may be just as strong and potent in any other land, on the isles of the sea, at sea, or in the midst of battle. The Lord draws no boundaries, nor is He a respecter of persons. We are privileged to have been allowed to live upon the earth in this day, and we should seek to cast aside many of our fears and keep alive in our hearts the spirit of thanksgiving. Page 680 Shanks We should echo in our souls this song of praise: Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations (Psalm 100). May the spirit of thankfulness enterin us. May we be mindful of the goodness of the Lord. As we view the provisions which we have provided for our children according to the advice of our inspired leaders, as we live in accordance with the laws of the Gospel so that we may be in a position to ask for special blessings and protection whenever the need may arise,-let us always remember to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in our affairs, to resign our will to His, and ever keep alive in us the spirit of thanksgiving. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving (Col. 2:6-7)., M.

Whitaker Effie F. Meeks August 25, 1943 Western Canadian Cuaprer VIII Synopsis: Janet, reared in the East, martied to a western rancher, finds life all but unendurable in her San Juan desert home because of her torturing fears of the country and the Indians. After the birth and death of her first child she is unable to be happy enough with the man she loves to endure her surroundings. After a temporary reconciliation, she goes to Washington, D. C. For a visit with her father.... Three years go by in which neither Janet nor Paul finds happiness. They alternate between the East and the West, content with neither. When Janet learns she is to have another child, she stays on in Washington. Paul, overjoyed, plants a \"swing-tree\" for his son. While he is at work, Dr. Potsworth brings him a telegram informing him that Janet has twins. Paul's joy is tempered by the fear that Janet will never want to return to El Toro again, afraid for her children now. Dr. Potsworth gives her a month and a half to come home to show off her babies. Paul learns that Dr. Groneman, the specialist who attended Janet in the strange illness that preceded the birth of her first child, has lost his eyesight. Paul can but offer sanctuary to so true a friend, but he fears what the presence of a blind man in their home may do to Janet. JANET'S hand shook until she I could hardly hold the receiver to her ear. The thought of hearing Paul's voice again had all but unnerved her. Then the call went through. \"Hello. Hello, Paul!\" she cried. \"Janet! Darling, where are you? IsIs anything wrong?\" \"Of course not. I'm tired but otherwise perfectly all night. I can hardly wait for you to get here to help me home.\" \"Get to Washington? Janet, II can't come. J\" Page 682 \"I'm in Grayson, Paul. Didn't you get my telegram?\" \"Grayson! Janet, I'll be right up there. How are the babies? Janet, I'm as excited as a schoolboy!\" \"Paul, they're grand. You'd never \"Janet, let's not stop to talk.- I'll almost fly there. Good-by. No... Don't hang up! Where are you? Are you where you can rest till I get there? Oh, of course. I forgot about. Doc. Sure. Sure, he'll make you comfortable. Good-by, Janet. I'll burn up the roadboulders, sand, and dugways.... Good-by!\" Janet leaned against the wall for support, laughing, half crying. Dr. Potsworth beamed approval. \"He didn't get my telegram, Doctor. Whatever could have happened to it?\" \"Seems to me I saw something that might have been a telegram. Thought I'd saunter over to El Toro this afternoon with it. Paul'll save me a trip.\" \"You old conniver! You kept that telegram on purpose!\" Janet didn't know whether to laugh or be angry. She had counted so on Paul's being there to meet her. Doctor Potsworth chuckled. \"I must be getting old. To forget a thing like that!\" \"You didn't forget. You figured a little waiting would whet our appetites. I know you.\" She began to laugh. \"Oh it was good to hear Paul's voice! I can hardly wait to TOMORROW'S CUP see his eyes when I stack the twins in his arms.\" \"Aren't they a little young for such a trip?\" Potsworth innocently asked. \"Dr. Eldred was quite upset about it. He thought they were far too young. But even Rhae agreed that I owe Paul a sight of his own children.\" \"Paul owes me twelve heifer calves!\" the doctor said with seeming irrelevance. That night riding home in the car with Paul, excited and tired from her long trip from Washington, Janet listened to Paul's recital of all that had happened in her absence. He told her of the birth of Juanee's baby girl; of the death of the trapper's wife down on the river; about Warren Newsbaum's new dude ranch; Mike's periodic jail sentences. \"Did you ever find out how Mike got the turquoise cross from Juanee's mother?\" Janet asked. \"I think about that more than anything else.\" \"He tied her up and searched the lodge, but he didn't hurt her. That is not bodily; Mike's too big a coward for that. He knew Chief Dodge would kill him if he harmed her in anyway, so he kidnapped her.\" \"That wouldn't be an easy matter; she's a determined woman, Paul.\" \"Which accounts for the condition the lodge was in. She put up a pretty big fight. They hid her in a cave, leaving her to get home the best way she could, while they came straight to El Toro.\" \"If Chief Dodge had come and found her gone, Mike would have had plenty to worry about, the old 683 renegade. Much has happened, of course, since I left, Paul, but couldn't you really have come to Washington?\" \"You can't possibly know how much I wanted to come, Janet. I'd worked day and night to get things in shape so I couldand then Dr. Groneman came.\" \"Mark Groneman?\" Janet was surprised at this casual tone, a tone that sounded as if he were telling her something she already knew. He seemed nervous and apologetic, choosing his words with unnecessary care. \"You mean our Dr. Groneman? What are you saying, Paul?\" Janet was bewildered. \"Yes Janet, our Dr. Groneman. He is blind. HeWell, he's come to Fl Toro to spend the summer. Will you mind, Janet?\" \"Blind! Paul, that's incredible. You actually sound serious.\" At the mention of Mark Groneman's name, Janet had the feeling that she was still in that painfully semi-conscious state that had first brought Groneman to El Toro. \"I am serious, Janet. I wish with all my heart it weren't so.\" Janet steeled herself against the plea for understanding in his eyes. \"But Paul, even if what you say is true, why should he choose El Toro as his retreat from the world? What could his coming be but a wounded flight, like that of a maimed animal to its lair?\" Every fiber of her body cried out against it. El Toro had done enough to her! She wanted to be alone with Paul and her children. She had brought them back to El Toro because they were Paul's as well as hers; she had not expected to share them with a stranger. 684 \"I should have written to you about him,\" Paul apologized. \"I thoughtIs his coming an annoyance, Janet?\" 'There was grave disappointment in Paul's voice. Janet would have given anything to say she didn't mind, but her emotion was too great. A blind man groping from room to room, needing more care than a child. Helpless, despondentto come home to that! She tried to look at Paul, to say something commonplace, but couldn't. The desert had risen to strike her again. Not as a snake. Not as an Indian. In the guise of a friend! She forced herself to look at her husband. His face was white, his lips still. Paul expected her approval and she couldn't give it. Again she had not measured up. \"T'm sorry, Janet,\" he said, avoiding her eyes. \"Groneman will have to go.\" \"No, Paul. I'llI'll do my best not to let it make any difference. Just give me time toto get used to the idea.\" She glued her eyes to the distant peaks.. Paul had told her once that sometime something would make her belong to El Toro. Something kindly and welcoming, she supposed he meant. When? When? Would she ever need it more than now? \"Thanks, Janet,\" Paul said. \"If it proves too much for you, we'll work out something later.\" Janet laid her hand over his. Somewhere in the blue distance elephants marched along Gray Mesa; stars gleamed above Hotel Collins, and a night owl called. She had not been afraid that night on the Mesa; she would not be afraid now. \"TI feel better already,\" she said, and laughed with relief. THE months to come, were to show her that Dr. Groneman had not come to E] Toro as a wounded animal to lick its wounds, but as a man in search of a spiritual haven. His acceptance of the inevitable was an inspiration to her. His superb senses, his sensitive hands, the perfect coordination of his muscles made it possible for him to act independently, even in his blindness. Not once had she seen him stumble, and he never asked for help. He and Paul talked together hours on end and she often joined them in the patio when her work was done, and the babies were asleep for the night. They were strangely alike, these two men of such widely different paths. Both had an amazing capacity for the enjoyment of simple thingssand lilies, the smell of rain, the sound of wind in a canyon. Both had keen insight into the ways of plants and animals, wisdom concerning men. In their diversities they found stimulation. Dr. Potsworth often drove over during the evenings, and they'd talk far into the night. When Paul had to ride the range, Groneman turned to his typewriter and worked tirelessly. From the evenings' talks Janet knew much of what would go into those typewritten pages. Somehow it made El Toro seem the safest, happiest place in the world. Through his sightless eyes she was finding sight for her own. Unconsciously she'd fallen into the habit of close scrutiny of everything around her, for Dr. Groneman was sure to ask what she did and what she saw. Of all the things on the desert the yucca seemed to fascinate him most. One evening she remarked that the screen was white with tiny moths. TOMORROW'S CUP 'Yucca moths, no doubt,\" he said. Janet waited, knowing there was a story to follow. Presently he began: 'It's strange how the yucca achieves fertilization.... Seeing the white moths on the screen made me think of it.\" That was one of the delightful things about him. He always 'saw' the things they talked about. \"Tell me,\" she said. \"It must be significant, you are so thoughtful about it.\" \"It shows how utterly dependent we are, plants upon insects, people upon each other.\" There was a pause while he measured the length of his cane against his chest. \"The manner in which the yucca is fertilized,' he went on, \"is one of the wonders of plant life. In the bellshaped, pendulous blossom of our beautiful desert plant, the anthers containing the pollen dust are nowhere near the stigma cup that should receive it. So the plant depends upon certain little white moths to pollinate it, otherwise it couldn't survive.\" \"How interesting,\" Janet said enviously. \"I've been so absorbed with with other phases of the country less pleasant onesthat I have failed to notice things like that.\" \"We all have to become initiated. And not all of the things around us are as interesting as yucca moths. During the day they rest with folded wings, singly or in pairs, within the half-closed blossoms. But at night the female sets to work scraping pollen from the anthers. When she has secured enough for her needs, she shapes it into a pellet two or three times the size of her head, then flits away to another flower and de- 685 posits an egg in the soft tissue of the pistil. Then she runs to the top of the pistil, turns around and thrusts the pollen ball into its little funnel, poking it down with her head, unconsciously pollinating the plant. The seed that forms after pollination is the food for her young.\" Janet remained silent, seeing the desert forested with tall blossoming yucca plants. A white moth would never again be meaningless to her. \"I'm afraid I've thought too much about the spikes to appreciate the blossoms,\" she said. \"I read a story once of a Spanish native who tried to gain his freedom from slavery by attempting a passage through a thicket of 'Spanish bayonets,' \" \"Yucca Gloriosa,\" Groneman interrupted. \"Their stiff dagger-like leaves stand as high as a man's head. No wonder they are called bayonets. No flesh and blood creature could survive such an ordeal as trying to penetrate their thicket.\"\n\"No. The poor fellow didn't have a chance.\"\n\"But the spikes have a reason for their existence, Janet. They guard the most beautiful of all the yucca blossoms.\"\nGroneman got up and walked toward the door. \"Shall we brush the moths from the screen and sit in the patio?\" he asked. \"I hear the weird beat of the tom-toms.\"\n\"The Indians are making ready for the ceremonial dances. Juanee's boys can hardly wait till they are called to participate.\"\n\"Aren't they too young?\"\n\"That's left to the discretion of the chief.\"\n\"How old are they?\"\n\"Nine, and almost as resourceful as men. So perfectly one that they rarely act independently of each other,\" Janet said. \"I have watched them grow with almost as much pride as Juanee.\"\n\"Here they come now, riding like wild Comanches.\"\nJanet looked in all directions but could see no one. \"Why, how do you know that, Doctor Groneman?\" Then seeing his slow smile and his listening attitude, she understood. \"Your ears! I marvel at you more every day. I can hear the boys now, too.\"\n\"They ride fearlessly, don't they?\"\n\"That's the way they do everything. I'd be scared to death if they were my boys, but Juanee accepts that just as she does everything else. She's waiting in her doorway now, I'll wager, waiting to decide the winner.\"\n\"I hate to leave El Toro,\" the young doctor said unexpectedly.\nJanet hardly realized the significance of his words. \"Leave?\" she questioned.\n\"I shall go at the week end, Janet. I must get to a library and to a secretary. I've been lazy long enough.\"\nJanet didn't protest. She knew his fight was hardly begun; but also that he was equal to it. So she said quietly: \"Then we must do something special tomorrow.\"\nPaul came home soon after dark, and as soon as he had bathed and changed clothes he joined them in the patio. He relaxed into his favorite chair, stretching out his long frame and sighing with contentment.\nJanet asked after the affairs of the day.\n\"Oh, there's something I must tell you,\" Paul said. \"I went to the jail to see Mike as I promised you I would, Janet. The lazy old scamp is really enjoying himself. His latest sentence was up a month ago but he doesn't want to leave. Except for the matter of firewater he has everything he desires.\"\n\"Did you take him the grape juice I made?\"\n\"Sure thing. I took it to him on my way out to the range. I stopped again on the way back tonight. He thanked me civilly for your offering, but he was plainly mystified. 'What's matter?' he asked, rubbing his stomach in perplexity. 'No hot! Me drinkum one. Me drinkum two. Still me no sing!'\"\nGroneman roared with laughter. \"What a story to tell my colleagues,\" he cried. \"I'll be the center of attraction as long as my San Juan yarns hold out. That's one compensation for being a bachelorthere's always an audience.\"\n\"For escape literature?\" Janet laughed. \"I don't know whether that's complimentary or not.\"\nShe rose to go in. \"Poor old Mike, I forgave him long ago,\" she said. \"You two talk all night if you want to. I have a couple of live issues to settle all by myselfJerry and Paulette. They've been fussing for some time.\"\nLong after she had gone to bed Janet could hear the drone of the men's voices. Mark had told Paul, no doubt, that he was leaving to take up life again. What would they all be doing when they saw him again? The thought brought back a little of her old restlessness. With Dr. Groneman gone, Paul would be away more and more to catch up the tag ends of his neglected business.\n\"Remember the yucca moths,\" she said to cheer herself. \"The blossoms and not the spikes!\"\nShe went to sleep thinking of her father and Rhae, and she was lonely for the first time since she had come back from Washington.\nPaul left again at daylight. Janet woke with the determination that Mark Groneman's last day at El Toro must be something to remember. Something that would carry over to the hours of solitude that must come once he left the peace and security of El Toro. Traffic and frantic rush would replace the leisurely days and scented desert nights he'd spent here. If he had married, there might have been children to make all the difference, now that he so desperately needed something to anchor him.\nShe dressed hurriedly, planning a special breakfast to begin the day.\n\"Know what I'd like to do?\" Groneman asked, coming to the kitchen door. \"Umthat smells good. Hot maple syrup! Mind if I taste?\" He filled a spoon and sipped the syrup with boyish enjoyment.\n\"What would you like to do?\" Janet asked, understanding for the first time that this man was not unhappy, and that she and Paul had helped to make it so, and the twins, Jerry and Paulette. How unprofessionally he had rocked them to sleep! She knew, too, that in the years to come El Toro would claim this famous man again and again.\n\"Paulette is to be my special charge,\" Dr. Groneman said, almost as if he had read her thoughts. \"I have a big house and an aunt to manage it. When Paulette is six, I shall come for her.\"\nJanet laughed good-naturedly. \"She'll be engaged to Paul by that time; they are already inseparable. In the meantime we have a day to celebrate. What shall it be? What do you want to see?\"\n\"The San Juan River at the bridge. The Goosenecks; and if possible a storm on the desert!\"\nThe river! Janet steeled herself against her old instinctive fear. A dozen excuses clamored in her mind. Apparently inattentive, Dr. Groneman sipped another spoonful of syrup. You couldn't explain unreasoning fear to a man like that! And besides, this was his dayperhaps his last dayat El Toro.\nShe broke an egg into a bowl. \"Yes. Yes, we'll go to the river! We'll do all the sightsand come home\"\n\"Ravenously hungry,\" Dr. Groneman finished sagely.\n(To be continued)\nHappy Ending (Continued from page 678)\nface until he could look into her eyes. \"Remember all those fairy stories we used to read together? Always had a happy ending, didn't they?\"\nShe nodded. Her eyes were shining.\nHe went on, tenderly, \"Every fellow going to war wants to leave his mother with his dad. Mother and Dad! Does that sound swell together? We'll have to dash to meet the train, Mom. We can't have a wedding without the bridegroom. Boy! I'll be a knockout as the best man!\"\nVera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer\nRegulations governing the submittal of material for \"Notes from the Field\" appear in the Magazine for June 1942, page 420."

Reuben Clark, Jr.\nAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man (Luke 2:40-52).\nITHE JOURNEY FROM NAZARETH TO JERUSALEM\nIt was a spring day at the end of March (near the middle of the seventh Hebrew month, Nisan), the fields were yellowing with the ripening crops, the hills and valleys were covered with wild flowers, all nature rejoiced, as Joseph and Mary and Jesus, their kinsfolk and neighbors, left Nazareth with its white rocks and cliffs, splotched with green, and started down through the foothills to the valley floor of the plain of Jezreel, one thousand feet below. They were going to Jerusalem to observe the Passover, as had been their wont over the years, in obedience to the Rabbinical law, commending (and in certain instances requiring) the observance of the feast in Jerusalem by the Levitically clean males of Israel. The women were not legally bound to attend. The feast was a jubilee of great rejoicing for it marked the anniversary of Israel's delivery from a grievous bondage to the Egyptians, and also her birth as a nation.\nThis journey has particular significance because it is the first appearance of Jesus in the sacred record, following His return with Mary and Joseph, to Nazareth from Egypt. After this appearance, there is another silence of eighteen years about Jesus, when being about thirty years old, He appears on the banks of the Jordan to be baptized of John. While history is silent about those first twelve years, we may reasonably know what His life was like. Joseph was a carpenter, and Jesus was undoubtedly learning the trade, for years after, when friends and neighbors for the second time rejected Him from Nazareth, they asked: \"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary...?\" But \"From the first days of its existence, a religious atmosphere surrounded the child of Jewish parents.\"? This would come first from the mother, but the father was under a sacred obligation to teach his son. At the age of five or six the child was sent to school, where he began a regular course, the Bible being the exclusive textbook until the boy was ten years of age. This Bible study began with Leviticus, then passed to the other parts of the Pentateuch, thence to the Prophets, and thence to the Hagiographa,that portion of the Bible not in the law and the prophets. From ages ten to fifteen, the child studied the Mishnah, or traditional law. When he reached the academies of the Rabbis he studied the Gemara or Talmud, but a boy might not enter these till he was fifteen. We have no means of knowing whether or not Jesus attended one of these schools, but the astonishment of the doctors in the Temple over His learning would indicate He had received from somewhere, most unusual and profound wisdom and knowledge. But at twelve years, a boy became a \"son of the law,\"? subject to the fasts and under obligation to attend the feasts. So as these pilgrims wended downward over the foothills in the afternoon (in Palestine the first day of the journey was always a short one), they were a joyous group, chanting as they went the \"Psalms of Ascent\" (Psalms 120-134), to the accompaniment of a flute.?\nAs we think of them moving slowly down into the valley with their donkeys laden with necessary supplies, picking their way among the boulders that strewed the path, we cannot escape wondering what were the thoughts of Jesus. That He was exceeding wise, the experience in the Temple shows. But was this wisdom earthborn from His studies, or did He have also a spiritual memory that brought to Him a recollection of all that had before happened, and a vision to show what was thereafter to happen along this road to Jerusalem, a road richer in incidents of God's dealings with his children, than any other road on the face of the earth?\nAs to memory of the past, we do know that during His later Judean ministry, while speaking to the Jews in the treasury to the Temple, He declared: \"I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.... I speak that which I have seen with my Father.\"? And out on the Mount of Olives, after they had left the Passover Chamber, on the night before the crucifixion, Jesus said to His apostles: \"For all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\"? Thus in His later ministry, His mind was filled with knowledge gained in His pre-existence.\nWe do not know the details of their journey to Jerusalem, but they may well have stopped the first night at Nain, where later He raised the son of the widow;? or if the start were early enough they might have gone on to Jezreel, once the second capital of the northern kingdom. One wonders if, as He came to Nain, He saw a vision of His future miracle of kindness there. And here we may recall that in pre-vision He said to Peter in the Passover Chamber, answering Peter's protestations of faithfulness: \"I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.\"?\nWhen He came to the neighborhood of Jezreel, did He see in vision the disastrous defeat of Josiah on the plain of Esdraelon by Pharaoh Necho, at Megiddo, a defeat so terrible and worked so deeply into the Hebrew heart, that John speaks of the great last battle as Armageddon\"the hill of Megiddo?\" Or did He see the earlier conflict in the time of the Judges, when Barak, Deborah the prophetess guiding, defeated Sisera, leading the forces of Jabin, on that same plain of Esdraelon, and did He see again the deed of Jael afterwards? And did there also come before Him the iniquities and tragic fate of Ahab and Jezebel, and the Lord's vengeance worked through Elijah against the priests of Baal, and the flight of Elijah to Carmel, the passing of the Lord before Elijah in the \"still small voice\"? For Jesus was the Lord who spoke to and commanded His ancient prophets.\nBut wherever the first night was spent, the start the next morning was early. They now moved on Roman roads, as they passed on southwards towards the city of Samaria. Crossing the headwaters of the River Kishon (which waters and drains the plains of Esdraelon), they would begin the ascent of the pass over the Carmelite range, the hill slopes probably covered with the yellow flowers of the broom. Villages dotted the high points along the way. They found rich orchards and vineyards on the summit and as they looked around them they could catch, here and there, glimpses of the Mediterranean (off to the west) and looking back to the north, they could see the snowy summit of Mount Hermon. Over to the left as they climbed up the pass, they had seen the rugged volcanic mountains of Gilboa, at the foot of which was fought the great battle between Saul and the Philistines, and where Saul killed himself. To the northeastward was Endor, the place where the witch lived whom Saul consulted, the Lord having failed to direct him, \"neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\"?\nAs they went forward over the undulating pass, they crossed a part of the plain of Dothan,? where Joseph was sold to the Ishmaelites.? Finally, passing the summit, they descended by easy grades to the city of Samaria, located on an isolated hill 300 feet above the surrounding country.? Samaria was the next capital of the northern tribes after Shechem. It had been frequently destroyed but now as Jesus came to it, it was a great city, rebuilt by Herod the Great, with magnificent palaces, temples, and a stadium. The plain surrounding the city was exceedingly fertile, covered with orchards of figs and olives. Its beauty and its future provoked Isaiah to speak of its \"glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer.\"? But here in the years long gone, before this visit, there had been planted a grove of Astarte (Venus), and Jezebel had erected a great temple to that same heathen goddess.? Elisha had lived at the foot of the hill on which the city rested;? and to this house came Naaman, the Syrian leper, to be healed. Elisha dwelt here when he disclosed to Ahab the plans of the Syrian generals. Here, when Benhadad the Syrian besieged it, was the scene of the great famine, so sore it was that women ate their own sons.\nWhat must have been the feelings of the young Jesus as He looked at this present magnificence and then recalled the past, and (it seems it must be) visioned the future!\nAs the pilgrims went forward they were joined by others also going to the Passover in Jerusalem. On through the day, as newcomers flowed into the group, they renewed, time and again, the chant of the \"Psalms of the Ascent.\" They lived over again in thought and story how here the Lord had blessed them and delivered them from Egyptian bondage. But of all the throng, no one but He Himself knew that that Lord traveled with them, for we must believe there was with Him a spiritual recollection, a divine knowledge, of the past.\nWhether they stopped at Samaria or went on two hours further to Shechem, we do not know. But they were traveling over historic ground that reached in incident clear back to Abraham. They may, because of the prejudice against the Samaritans, have so planned their journey as to pass through Samaria in one day. But we cannot tell.\nAs they came into the midst of Shechem itself, they came to the very spot where the waters divided, those flowing to the west into the Great Sea, those to the east into the Jordan. The city lies where the two mountains, Ebal and Gerizim, falling away one from the other, leave a beautiful, fertile valleythe very cradle of Israel. To this valley, running out west and east from the city, came Abraham and Lot, forsaking at the Lord's command their own country under a promise that this land should be theirs.? Here lived Jacob and his family; Jacob whose name was here changed to Israel.? Here Joshua gathered the people and had them repeat the curses and blessings declared by Moses in the wildernessReuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali to stand upon Mount Ebal for the curses, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin to stand on Mount Gerizim for the blessings, the Levites repeating the curses and the people shouting amen.? Here was consummated the rebellion which divided Israel, after which Jeroboam built Shechem, and brought about the return of idolatry to Israel.? Here in the immediate area was Joseph's tomb;? at the eastern foot of the valley is the traditional site of the oak of Abraham, beneath which he built an altar,\" \"the first sanctuary to Jehovah in the Promised Land,\"\" and later Joshua built there 721 an altar \"under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the Lord.\"\" Near to the site of this sanctuary is Jacob's well. On the top of Mount Ebal, Joshua placed the stones on which he had written the Law.\" The Samaritans believed the stones were atop Mount Gerizim.\" On the top of this mountain the Samaritans held their Passover feast,\" and the woman of Samaria, years later, said to Jesus at Jacob's well near the foot of Gerizim: \"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain\"; to which Jesus replied: \"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.\"\" The Samaritans claimed that to this mountain Abraham came to offer Isaac as a sacrifice.* As Jesus looked at all these, probably for the first time with His mortal eyes, there must have crowded in upon His consciousness the scenes of the actual events. The divinity that was in Him must have reached back into the past even as, when later in His ministry, after the first Passover, He traveled northward through Samaria and stopped at the well to get a drink from the Samaritan woman drawing water from the well, He reached into the past of this sinful woman. As He taught her, and she understood not, He said: ''Go, call thy husband, and come hither.\" \"T have no husband,\" said she. \"Thou hast well said, I have no husband,\" He replied. \"For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband.\" If the 25/ Geikie, p. 489. 26/Gen. 12. 27/ Gen. 32:28; 33:18. 28/ Joshua 8:32; Deut. 27. 29/1 Kings 12; id 12:25. 476. 33/ Joshua 24:26. 30/ Joshua 24:32. 34/ Deut. 27:4 ff. 35/ Geikie, p. 483. 31/ Gen. 12:6 ff A.

And did He vision, as at twelve He now first beheld the well mortally, the future meeting with the woman and His sermon on the living water?\" But whether the pilgrims stopped at Samaria or at Shechem, or whether before they reached there or after, yet as they went on towards Jerusalem along the Roman road, they passed constantly the places where other great happenings in Israel's history took place. About halfway, going southward, between Shechem and Bethel lies Shiloh. It was here that Joshua came with the Tabernacle and Ark after he left Gilgal, and it was here that he cast lots for the division of the Promised Land among the tribes.\" It was from Shiloh that the Benjamites (following the terrible punishment inflicted upon them by Israel for the abuse of the concubine of the Levite), stole the dancing virgins for wives. Here lived Eli and here was trained Samuel; and to Shiloh came the Philistines, and defeated the sons of Eli and carried off the Ark.\" As the group moved southward from Shiloh towards Bethel, there would likely come to them, increasingly as they neared Jerusalem (for under the Rabbinical law every male Jew over twelve years living within fifteen miles of Jerusalem was obliged to attend the Passover),\" other pilgrims to the Temple and the great feast. And ever as they marched forward over the Roman highway, they would be chanting the sacred Psalms. On the right, to the westward, shortly after the group left Shiloh, lay the old Ephraimite Gilgal, whence went Elijah and Elisha on their way to the Jordan before Elijah was taken into Heaven.\" From a hill at the side of a wild pass a little farther south, they could look back and still see Mount Hermon with its cap of snow.\" As they went down the other side of the pass, they traveled through great orchards of fig trees and olives. This was the rich tertitory of Ephraim.\" And then came Bethel, a great sanctuary. Abraham came to Bethel from Shechem, and again after his return from Egypt. On his first visit he built an altar, to which he returned after Egypt. It was here that Israel assembled when they determined to war on Benjamin for the violation of the concubine of the Levite.\" It was here also that, after the rebellion of the Ten Tribes, Jeroboam set up one of the two golden calves he made for them to worship, the other calf went to Dan.\" One can but wonder how shallow must have been Israel's conversion to the true God, to be so easily turned back to Egyptian idolatry. Jehu left the calf though he rooted out Baal,\" but Josiah broke down the altar and \"stamped it small to powder.\"\" To the west and slightly to the south of Bethel, was Ai, and still 40/ John 4:7 ff. 41/ Joshua 18 ff. 42/ Judges 19, 21. 43/1 Sam. 4:10 ff. 44/ Geikie, p. 183. 45/II Kings 2. 46/ Geikie, p. 468. 47/ Geikie, p. 467. 48/ Gen. 12:7; 13:4. 49/ Judges 20:17. 50/1 Kings 12:28 ff. 51/II Kings 10:24 ff. 52/II Kings 23:15. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS further south, Ramah and Gibeon. Between these two latter Joshua fought the great battle against the Amorites, when, the day waning, without time to finish his victory that great warrior cried out, \"In the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.... So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.' The growing group was now near Michmash, too, close to where Jonathan with only his armorbearer put to rout the Philistines, for Jonathan had said: \"It may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.'\" Still nearer to Jerusalem was Gibeah, the site of the shameful deed of Benjamin, and the home and headquarters of Saul while he was king.\" The pilgrims were now in the environs of Jerusalem. If they reached there just before the Passover, they found the roads choked with the tens of thousands who were coming to the City of David to attend the feast, bringing with them their burnt and peace offerings, for none might appear empty. In Jesus' time as many as 256,000 lambs were slain for the Passover. The population of the city at Passover time varied from 2,500,000 to 3,000,000. Many who came camped outside the city; others found quarters within the city walls with friends or relatives who hospitably took them in, the guests leaving, as they took their departure, 53/ Joshua 10:6 ff. 723 \"the skins of the Passover lambs and the vessels they had used in their sacred services\"; still others went to neighboring towns, Bethpage and Bethany being mentioned in the Talmud as especially hospitable. The shouts of greeting that passed between old friends again meeting; the chanting of the sacred psalms by the coming worshipers keyed to a high pitch by their long journey of anticipation, their presence in the city of the fathers, the nearness of the Passover, and the gratitude for their ancient deliverance; the lowing of the cattle brought for burnt offerings; the bleating of the sacrificial lambs; the cooing of the doves for peace offeringsall must have mingled into a babel of sound never to be forgotten, and heard from afar it must have been like the roar of a distant waterfall. We must believe that Joseph and Mary, and the youth Jesus, of the royal lineage of David, had awaiting them somewhere a joyous welcome from friends honored in the chance to give them food and shelter. One cannot escape the question whether they went on to Bethany, eastward of Jerusalem, for their lodgings, to the home where in the years to come Jesus spent so many happy hours in an abode that loved and honored Him. Did the youth Jesus know the youth Lazarus, and the maidens, Mary and Martha? Or did they go to Bethlehem, where twelve years before the Messiah was born in a manger?

Places Jesus Loved Elder Thomas Cottam Romney President of the Central States Mission PALESTINE, or as it is frequently called, the Holy Land, is the most charming bit of territory in the entire world to the followers of Christ. There are countries more picturesque if by that term is meant mountain peaks whose castellated formations pierce the azure to dizzy heights with peaceful lakes nestling at their feet; go to Switzerland for such. If, however, you long for gently rolling hills and peaceful countryside and shady lanes, visit England and feast upon her beauty and dream of romance. But if you want to feel the thrill which comes from standing on holy ground, consecrated and sanctified by the life and sacred blood of the Master, make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. As you approach the Jordan River from the east, you will be breathless with emotion, not of the hilarious type, but the deep, reverential emotion such as one would experience if he were approaching the sacred precincts of a holy temple. A feeling akin to that felt by Moses as he came upon the burning bush out of which he heard the voice of Jehovah commanding: \"... Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground;\" or even that which almost overcame Israel as they came near the sacred Mount of Sinai amid the thunderings of that holy mountain. Follow the Jordan to where it enters the Sea of Galilee from the north and you will witness, as you behold that expanse of water, one of the most enchanting pictures Page 724 of all of the multifarious designs etched by Mother Nature to please the artistic taste of man. No place in Palestine was more loved by Jesus than the Sea of Galilee. It was here around the borders of this inland sea that His time was chiefly spent in preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. It was from the fishing boats so abundant on the bosom of the lake in those days that the Master invited Peter and Andrew his brother and James and John, the sons of Zebedee, to leave their nets and come and follow Him \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" 'To the publican Levi or Matthew, who sat at the receipt of customs in the city of Capernaum he said: \"Follow me. And he arose and followed him.\" It was here that Jesus wrought His first miracle, if we -accept the testimony of the synoptic writers. In the synagogue at Capernaum on the Sabbath Day a man with an unclean spirit cried out: \"... What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth...? And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.\" And the evil spirit obeyed. The landscape of Galilee has remained unchanged throughout the centuries since the Savior looked upon it, save for the thriving cities nestled around its shores. All have disappeared but one and that is Tiberius, a gentile city whose origin antedated the birth of Christ by a quarter of a century. Capernaum, Bethsaida, Chorazin and the other PLACES JESUS LOVED Courtesy Publishers Photo Service LOOKING ACROSS THE SEA OF GALILEE FROM TIBERIUS seven or eight cities have passed away and only a few ruins remain to bear witness that they once stood there by the sea. These ruins forcibly remind us of the prophetic nature of the Son of God when he declared: \"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which were done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.\" \"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works, which were done - in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\" Speaking of the thriving conditions around the shores of Galilee and its environs in the days of Christ, Dr. Fosdick says: 725 Here in the Master's time ran trunk roads, with busy traffic passing to and fro and tax gatherers sitting at the customhouses to collect the tolls. Here were cities which he could compare with Tyre, Sidon and Nineveh and from which, as public attention centered in him, a great multitude followed him and they thronged him.... Here on the shores were fleets of fishing boats, and on the shores, miles of nets to be dried and mended. Everywhere about the lake the Master moved in the midst of populous, opulent, cosmopolitan life where a man might gain the whole world and lose his soul and where at times the exacting throng so wearied him that he had to go apart and rest awhile. Contrast the present desolate appearance with such a picture of prosperity; but, aside from the dearth of population, the scene remains unchanged. As Mrs. Romney and I approached the sea from the north, we observed that the great profusion of flowers brought forth by the late 726 winter rains had disappeared and the grasses had turned to a deep brown under the persistent heat of the Palestinian sun. Yet there were colors in the landscape of a never-ending variety, from the deep green shades of the trees and brush to the purple colorings on the flank of the precipitous hills that rise sheer from the eastern shore of the Sea of Gallilee. Below, in front of us, we saw the placid waters of Galilee. Scarcely a tipple was to be seen on its bosom, so much in contrast to the picture portrayed by the synoptic writers in which we behold the Master stilling the tempest to save the lives of certain of His disciples exposed to the turbulence of the waves. Here in this body of water is typified the lesson of contrast. The water so calm and peaceful at one moment, in the course of a brief period may be a fury of waves capable of dashing into pieces the fisherman's sturdiest boat. Such was the testimony of a Palestinian who understood the fitful nature of this inland sea. While fish caught from the lake were being prepared for the midday meal, we were seeking respite from the oppressive heat by imbibing ice-cold soda pop and by fanning ourselves beneath the shade of trees adjacent to the edge of the lake. Not a breath of. Air seemed to reach us from the heights abovethe sea was a dead calm and not a leaf or blade of grass stirred, so still was the atmosphere about us. And yet, there was a fascination about this place, nearly seven hundred feet below the level of the sea. Perhaps it came from a knowledge that the Master had consecrated its shores with His divine presence and bathed His tired feet in its cooling waters. But robbed of its sacred historic connotations, it still would have a deep and abiding fascination for the tourist. The blueness of the water, the precipitous character of the limestone hills rising from the water's brink, the scattered thorn bushes all around the shore, and the blue sky overhead combined to produce a picture in nature which once seen, can never be forgotten. THE journey to Nazareth, twenty-five miles to the southwest, took us through the village of Cana where Jesus turned the water into wine at the marriage feast. Had we taken time, the very jars in which the water stood would have been pointed out to us, and maybe a sip of the wine would have been tendered us were we gullible enough to purchase it. Nazareth, the boyhood home of Jesus, is beautifully situated in a little valley and in the southern folds of the Galilean hills. From one of the highest points of the village can be seen the blue waters of the Mediterranean through a V-shaped valley off to the west. Upon this scene, no doubt, the Master as a youth was wont to gaze times without number. And down below was the plain of Esdraelon stretching from Mount Carmel on the west, to the Jordan on the east. Over this plain for thousands of years had been heard the tramp of footsteps of millions of fighting men from many parts of the world as they marched forth to battle. The clank of the sabre, and the whir of the chariot had been mingled with the groans and the shrieks of the dying as the soil drank the blood PLACES JESUS LOVED 727 Courtesy of President Joseph Jacobs. THE WAILING WALL AT JERUSALEM of myriads slain from Egypt and Assyria, from Babylonia and Syria, from the land of the Hittites and from Philistia and Moab. Caravans laden with goods from many parts of the world likewise used this plain as a thoroughfare of travel. Six miles from Nazareth, en route to Jerusalem, we passed on our left Nain, where Jesus raised to life the widow's son. A little farther on we beheld beautiful Mount Tabor with its symmetrical proportions rounded off like a hemisphere and covered with groves of oak and terebinths. Tradition points strongly to this Mount as being the scene of the transfiguration of Christ \"... And his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.\" Near the ancient city of Shechem we passed by the tomb of Joseph who was sold into Egypt and nearby was the traditional \"deep well\" from which Jesus was given water by the Samaritan woman. As we approached the city of Jerusalem from the north, we beheld a city sprawled over a desert area uninviting save to those who see beauty in an arid region. But to me, familiar with desert areas, there is a fascination and an allurement not to be met with elsewhere. The only natural source of water is an intermittent spring in the valley of Kidron insufficient to supply the city's needs. Cisterns have therefore been excavated from time immemorial for rain storage, and water has been led to the city by conduits from external sources, some of them far distant. Before entering the city, we could not refrain from visiting the Mount of Olives, a brief span to the east of Jerusalem. Over this Mount Jesus rode on His triumphant march into Jerusalem, and wept over the city as it came into view. Daily He must have passed over it during the time He lodged at the home of Mary and Martha before His trial and crucifixion. On its slope was probably the fig tree that He cursed and, at its foot and up its western slope was the Garden of Gethsemane where Christ was betrayed. It was likely on this Mount also that He gave His great eschatological discourse on the destruction of the Temple and the besiegement of Jerusalem in which He depicted the horrors which should overtake the Jewish people. And it was from here that He made His ascension into heaven.\nThe altitude of the spot on which we stood was 2637 feet above the level of the sea and 200 feet higher than the Temple mount. Toward the east and southeast we looked down into the very bowels of the earth, it seemed, and saw the Jordan River with its banks lined with trees and shrubs. We had a clear vision of the river to the point where it empties its water into the Dead Sea and, still farther on, we beheld that great inland body of salt water whose surface is 1300 feet below the Mediterranean. It was in the desert region to the west of the Dead Sea that Christ is believed to have spent His forty days in fasting, when tempted of the Devil.\nJerusalem has a population of more than 100,000. A portion of the city is new and splendid in all of its appointments while the old portion is much the same as it was when the Master trod its streets. The full-length, sombre gowns of the womenfolk as well as their headgear are reminiscent of the days of long ago when the Man of Galilee moved about the streets of this sacred metropolis. The camels and asses that thread the streets bearing burdens of merchandise and human freight could well be the progeny of remote ancestry that bore the burdens of Melchizedek, king and great high priest of Jerusalem, and his subjects at the time of the visit of Father Abraham on his way southward following the rescue of his kidnapped nephew Lot.\nOn the traditional spot where the temples of Solomon and Herod stood is the Dome of the Rock, one of the most impressive mosques of the Near East. Immediately under the Dome is a huge rock from which the mosque gets its name. On this rock is the imprint of what appears to be a human foot, the reputed footprint made by Mohammed at the time of his ascension into heaven. Near the Dome of the Rock is the Jewish Wailing Wall and to this spot come thousands of Jews yearly to pour out their souls in anguish in contemplation of the many disasters that have beset their race and with a prayer on their lips that the long period of exile from this promised land will soon end.\nBethlehem, where Jesus was born, is about six miles to the south of Jerusalem. It is beautifully situated on a ridge running east and west and commanding a splendid view of the surrounding country. The hills were somewhat more rugged than I had expected to see them and yet there was a peaceful beauty and quaintness about the whole landscape that was entrancing. The most interesting place in Bethlehem is the Church of the Nativity built by order of Constantine 330 A. D. at the suggestion of his mother, Helena. Within the Church is a star bearing the inscription, \"Here Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary.\" About this spot hang costly lamps of gold and silver belonging to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Armenian Churches. While we rejected in our minds the historicity of this spot as being the birthplace of the divine Christ, it served to remind us that in this neighborhood came into the world the Only Begotten of the Father whose mortal birth we will soon be celebrating."

            "content": "Thoughts on the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder A. William Lund Assistant Church Historian\nOn December 23, 1943, we celebrate the 138th anniversary of the birth of Joseph Smith, a Prophet of our Lord. The history of this good man, especially during the years from 1820 to 1844, is one of the most interesting stories ever told. Space will not permit of details but only a few thoughts concerning him. However, in this short period of time and in the face of all kinds of persecution, Joseph Smith accomplished a great work which still is a \"marvelous work and a wonder.\"\nIn the fifteenth year of his life the different religious sects, in his home town, were holding revival meetings. Joseph, being of a religious nature, attended these meetings with a desire to know which sect he should join. As each of these denominations taught different doctrines and each claimed to be right, his mind was confused at their claims. Being a reader of the Bible he read the words of the Apostle James: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"\nThese words so impressed the young man that he went into a wood where, in the humility of his soul, he poured out his heart in prayer to God that He would show him which church to join. This humble prayer was answered by the most glorious vision shown to man.\nThis boy saw two Personages, the glory of whom defied all description, standing above him. One of these persons, pointing to the other, said: \"This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\" Joseph was told to join none of the churches for \"they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\"\nWhen this young man told of his vision, he was laughed at and made light of but he answered: \"I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it.\"\nThrough this vision the young man revealed anew to the world the truth that God is a personal being and that Jesus Christ is His Son and is a personal being, separate from the Father.\nA few years passed and Joseph Smith, desiring to know what his standing was before the Lord, sought the Lord in humble prayer. In answer to this prayer an angel, named Moroni, was sent to give further instruction to this young man and to tell him where a sacred record of the early inhabitants of America was hidden. Also the angel told him that \"when these things begin to be known, that is, when it is known that the Lord has shown you these things, the workers of iniquity will seek your overthrow; they will circulate falsehoods to destroy your reputation, and also will seek to take your life; but remember this if you are faithful, and shall hereafter continue to keep the commandments of the Lord, you shall be preserved to bring these things forth.\"\nThis statement of the angel was literally fulfilled. When Joseph Smith received the plates he had to use every plan he could think of to keep the plates from falling into the hands of the enemy. Through his faithfulness, even though he was hindered in every way, he published to the world this record known as the Book of Mormon.\nThe angel also told him \"that the knowledge which this record contains will go to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people under the whole heaven.\" Here again is a prediction made to Joseph Smith before the record was printed, yet it, too, has been fulfilled. The Book of Mormon has been published in eighteen different languages and by means of the radio the knowledge it contains has been broadcast throughout the world.\nThe angel further said, speaking of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, \"when they are interpreted, the Lord will give the holy priesthood to some, and they shall begin to proclaim this Gospel and baptize by water, and after that they shall have power to give the Holy Ghost by the laying on of their hands. Then will persecution rage more and more.\"\nThe Priesthood was bestowed upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. On May 15, 1829, these two men received the Aaronic Priesthood from John the Baptist, and a short time later received the Melchizedek Priesthood under the hands of Peter, James and John, apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. After this Priesthood was restored and men were given the authority to perform the ordinances necessary to obtain eternal life, greater and more severe persecution was heaped upon Joseph Smith and his followers.\nThe angel also said to Joseph Smith: \"Your name shall be known among the nations, for the work which the Lord will perform by your hands shall cause the righteous to rejoice and the wicked to rage: with the one it shall be had in honour, and with the other in reproach.\" This statement made to this young, unknown man has had its literal fulfillment. Throughout the whole world his name is held in loving reverence by all his followersin honor and respect by his friends, and in reproach by his enemies.\nAt the time when the vision of the Father and His Son was given to Joseph Smith, when the Book of Mormon was brought forth and when the Priesthood of God was restored, there was no church upon the face of the earth, with all its learning, that understood or taught the doctrines of Jesus Christ, our Savior. This young man, without fear, but as the humble servant of God, gave to the world the true ordinances and doctrines of the Lord. He, under direct commandment, organized the Church of Jesus Christ with the same offices that the Lord Himself set up in His Church to bring all to the unity of the faith.\nThe Prophet affirmed that faith in the Lord, repentance from sin, baptism by immersion for the remission of sin, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands were absolutely essential to our salvation and necessary to enter Christ's Church. Joseph Smith also pointed out that all ordinances of the Gospel of our Lord must be performed by one having authority from God.\nHe taught that we all were the children of God and that our spirits were the offspring of our Eternal Father and that we lived with Him before we came upon this earth and had our spirits clothed upon with mortality. He preached that as Jesus Christ arose from the dead that we all should arise from the dead, and that this resurrection would be the re-uniting of our spirit with our body, even in the same manner that the resurrection of our Savior was a re-uniting of His spirit with His body. Also, he taught that after the resurrection the body and spirit could never again be separated.\nHe explained that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was the power of God unto salvation to everyone of our Father's children; that all those who had died, or who would yet die, who had not the chance to hear the Gospel, would be given that chance, that the ordinances necessary for the salvation of the living would be given to those who were dead by living persons acting as proxy for the dead persons; that our dear Lord gave His life thus doing a vicarious work for us that we could not do for ourselves, and that our Lord opened the way for the Gospel to be preached to the dead as His spirit preached to the dead while His body lay in the tomb. In fact, Joseph Smith taught all the principles and ordinances taught by our Lord as necessary to everlasting life.\nWhile restoring to the earth the fulness of the Gospel, receiving and publishing revelations from God, and establishing the Relief Society and other helps for his followers, Joseph Smith also showed himself as a remarkable leader in the temporal affairs of his people. He helped choose sites for cities and helped in their building. In the building of the Kirtland and Nauvoo temples he helped dig the excavations and also took part at the pinery to cut timber for them. The welfare of his people was always near to his heart; this is shown by the following story related of him by Brother Andrew Workman, of Virgin City, Washington County, Utah:\n\"I was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky, July 15th, 1824. Joined the Church in Overton County, Tennessee, March, 1842. I saw the Prophet Joseph for the first time in May of the same year. He was with about a dozen others on the stand in a meeting. I knew him as soon as I saw him. Although I was young I knew him to be a man of God. A few days after this I was at Joseph's house; he was there, and several men were sitting on the fence. Joseph came out and spoke to us all. Pretty soon a man came up and said that a poor brother who lived out some distance from town had had his house burned down the night before. Nearly all of the men said they felt sorry for the man. Joseph put his hand in his pocket, took out five dollars and said, 'I feel sorry for this brother to the amount of five dollars; how much do you all feel sorry?'\"\nWhen Commerce, later named Nauvoo, was purchased, the place was very swampy and he personally supervised its draining. He advised the best plants, shrubbery, and (Continued on page 744)"

            "content": "The 114th Semi-annual Conference Elder Richard L. Evans Member of the First Council of Seventy\nA comparative estimate of a general conference would in many respects be meaningless, because conference is a combination of many elements, and because perhaps its greatest values are intangible. And when, each time a conference closes, one hears the frequent remark, \"It was the best conference yet,\" it isn't just a thoughtless superlative. To those who so speak, it may be the best conferenceat least the best one they can remember. A particularly good meal of which we have just received a satisfying fullness is likely to be more acutely appreciated than a good meal of which we have partaken some time ago. And many felt that way about this conference.\nBeyond the intangibles, however, there are some statistical bases of comparison. The attendance at this conference was, for example, somewhat smaller than attendance in the immediate past. This was to be expected. Many priesthood officers of the Church are in the armed forces of the country. Many others are pressingly engaged in defense industries and activities. Farmers are pressed for help more acutely than in past years. Transportation, both private and public, is circumscribed by more difficulties than many of us can remember its ever having been. All this combined to reduce attendancenotwithstanding which the main body of the Tabernacle was comfortably and impressively filled.\nThis was the fourth semi-annual conference of the Church at which attendance has been restricted since the United States entered the warrestricted in consideration of the overtaxed burdens of the people and restricted in cooperation with the general program of economy in travel and man power.\nThe sessions began on Friday afternoon, October 1st, with general sessions, six in all, continuing Saturday morning, afternoon, and evening, and Sunday morning and afternoon. All of the general sessions, except the Saturday evening session, were broadcast through the facilities of Radio Station KSL. The regular nationwide Sunday morning KSL-C. B. S. Broadcast from the Tabernacle occupied the first thirty minutes of the Sunday morning session. Two special meetings were held concurrently Friday eveningone for bishoprics in the Assembly Hall and one for Welfare chairmen in the Young Memorial Building.\nPresident Heber J. Grant was in attendance much of the time, and had intended to speak, but, on the late advice of his physician, did not do so. President David O. McKay conducted all of the general sessions, and also read President Grant's message, which was one of blessing and reminderreminder that we are the architects of our own lives, and that no power anywhere can prevent any Latter-day Saint from being saved, except himself. The closing paragraphs of President Grant's talk follow:\nAs it was during our meetings last April in our annual conference, so today we have thousands of our young men in the armed forces of the warring nations. Constantly I pray that the Lord will bless each and every one, and that he will help each of them to live in accordance with the principles of the gospel, so that he may have a claim to the blessings of the Lord to the full extent that accords with his wisdom. I pray that, so far as it accords with the providences of the Lord, each of them may be preserved from accident, sickness, and death, to return in due course to his loved ones. I pray God to help them to stand up under the terrible strain which they must meet. I appeal to the Lord to bring the war to an end at the earliest possible date. Consequently my heart goes out in the deepest sympathy for the comforting influence of the Lord to be given to the fathers and mothers of the sons who are in the war at the present time. May the comforting influence of the Spirit of the Lord be given to them in carrying their burdens, and to bring solace to their yearning hearts. I am praying with all my heart and soul for the end of this war as soon as the Lord can see fit to have it stop, and am earnestly praying for the influence of the Spirit of the Lord to be with all who have loved ones in the war. I pray that the spirit of peace and of increased faith may pervade all the homes of the Latter-day Saints, and with all the power and authority I have to bless, I invoke God's blessing upon the Church as a whole and upon the honest in heart everywhere.\nPresident J. Reuben Clark, Jr. reviewed some of the remarkable accomplishments of the Church Welfare program, gave an account of Church finances and their stewardship, spoke of the illimitable possibilities of this people if they would work in oneness of purpose; and differentiated between communism and the United Order. Some of the sentences from his talk follow:\nThus far in 1943 our tithes have increased over 1942 by more than fifty percent.\nThe United Order and communism are not synonymous.... Those who go about telling us otherwise either do not know or have failed to understand or are wilfully misrepresenting.\nThere has come into the Church an ever-increasing spirituality because of the giving which has been incident to the carrying on of the Welfare work.\nThe Lord told his disciples.... That they must be one, and that he expected his people to be one.\nI am sure we have demonstrated in this Welfare program, and in the more or less auxiliary home canning, in what has heretofore been more or less of an experiment, what we can do, we of the Church, if we set our minds and our hearts on carrying out the admonition of our prophet in becoming self-sustaining.\nWe believe that if we included the canning done by Church families in the missions, the total number of cans of fruits and vegetables which we shall have in these three ways brought into storage for the next year, will approximate, if not exceed, 50,000,000 cans. This represents over 1,000,000,000 points.\nPresident David O. McKay, in a stirring address of the Saturday morning session, spoke on \"The Home Front.\" Social evils, selfishly restricted families, divorce, and the early training of children were among the subjects on which counsel and statistical fact were given. Said he:\nTeach the young people that marriage is not merely a man-made institution, but that it is ordained of God....\nIt is the duty of everyone to strive to make it possible that no soldier now dreaming of a happy homecoming may return only to find a broken home or its ideals shattered by the sinful indulgences of a member of the family.\nLife is too short and love too great to sacrifice one hour through pettiness.\nThe foundation of a happy home is laid during pre-marital days.\nSeeking the pleasures of conjugality without willingness to assume the responsibilities of rearing a family is one of the onslaughts that now batter at the structure of the American home.\nThis was the first conference to present President George Albert Smith in his new capacity as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. President Smith's address cited the historical disasters that had come to generations and centuries of nations and peoples who have refused to repent, and the blessings and forgiveness that have come to those who have turned to the Lord. His sermon carried with it the spirit of these passages in the 23rd chapter of Matthew:\nO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\nOccasions have not been frequent in the Church when two new members of the Quorum of the Twelve have been presented at the same conference. This was one such occasion. Elder Spencer W. Kimball and Elder Ezra T. Benson were sustained by the upraised hands of the priesthood of Israel and responded to their calls with humility and in the spirit of dedication.\nFrom Brother Kimball came this word:... I know that this is the Church and kingdom of God. It has been a part of me. Whenever it has prospered I have gloried in it. When it was criticized, it has hurt me, for it seemed a part of my very being. Every fibre in my body bears witness that this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness.\nAnd from Brother Benson: It has been my glorious privilege to be blessed with wonderful opportunities in my life. But my happiest days have been those spent with the priesthood and the membership of this Church. *... More than anything else, besides my desire to maintain my testimony, I desire the love and confidence of the priesthood of this church, and I pray the Lord to give me strength that I may merit that love and confidence.\nThose who listened by radio, and those who sat in the presence of these two new members of the Quorum of the Twelve, felt and knew that there are many good and wise and able men throughout the Church, and that the Lord had called two such to a high trust.\nAll the general authorities of the Church were present and presented messages. The space allotted here will not permit the recital even of the theme-sentence of eachbut there was a oneness of feeling about the entire proceedings; the addresses were uniformly thoughtful and satisfying and the conference was free from any jarring note or discordant thought. Fortunately, the entire (Continued on page 744)"

Excited children left harried parents and rushed to the Salvation Army Santa Claus for one last, quick instruction on how to find a particular chimney. The air was scented with pine and holly as men with great armloads pressed against her. Even the red, blue, and green lights had been fastened to the lampposts and they glowed with a gay, Christmasy brilliance. But Lucy frowned. The doctor had said it was neuritis that made her hip ache like that. He had told her to go home and to bed; but how could she? Just a few days before Christmas with so many things to do.\nThe bus was a long time coming. This year they'd all be together. The words had been humming through her heart all day. Even the pain was quiet when she thought of it. This Christmas must be perfect! Lucy wanted that more than she wanted anything in the world. Ever since she'd had that letter from Hal saying he was sure of his furlough, she had been planning. He was bringing his wife. The family had never met her, though Hal had sent her photograph and written ecstatically:... I was scared that she wouldn't have me. She's been reared by a very wealthy aunt, and I have so little to offer. But I turned on the charm, and she couldn't resist. You'll love her, Mother...\nLucy hoped so, but she wasn't so sure. She had scribbled a friendly little note welcoming Iris into the family and had received a very formal letter in return. Iris' life had been very different from the sort of harum-scarum growing up that Hal had had. Lucy wanted Iris to think well of the family. She had worked hard to make the house look nice. Iris was used to such elegance.\nAs she boarded the bus, Lucy thought about Ben's sister. She was coming to dinner, too. Ada was a grave old maid. She taught history at high school and Lucy had often pitied her the barrenness of her existence. Ada had missed so much.\nLucy dropped the token in the box and her lips were tender. How much fun Christmas had been when the children were small. But seeing the restless, almost dissatisfied faces about her, Lucy thought of the war. How hard it had become for anyone to have faith in the old, familiar words: Peace on earth, good will toward men! Why, even Link, who was only eleven wished he might have a real machine gun to shoot real bullets.\nLucy shivered as she got off the bus. Crossing the street she saw that the early winter sunset made an intricate pattern of shadows through the leafless trees. Then she forgot its beauty as she realized that Link had not cleaned the walks. When she opened the front door, she saw why he had neglected them. There was a cluster of dripping straps and ice skates on the floor. She must remember, she decided worriedly, to wipe up the snow before it left a stain on the polished floor.\n\"Is that you, Mother?\" The sound of a girlish voice floated down the stairs and Miriam appeared on the landing. She was a pretty girl of fifteen with blue eyes and a long V of brown curls reaching down to the middle of her shoulders. She had been painting her nails and was careful not to touch anything.\nLucy protested. \"That's entirely too dark a shade for a young girl.\"\nMiriam blew on her thumb, paying no attention. \"Did you get the material?\" she asked.\nLucy put her coat on a hanger. She put Miriam's, too, for Miriam had simply flung it on a hook. Then she pointed out a bundle.\n\"You open it,\" said Miriam. \"My nails might smudge.\"\nLucy undid the string. Her eyes were on Miriam's face. She did hope the silk would suit. She had had to go to four stores.\n\"Oh, dear,\" Miriam pouted, \"that isn't what I meant at all. Sally's is a lighter blue. We wanted them exactly alike.\"\nLucy folded the silk and fastened the string. As Miriam went upstairs, Lucy was conscious that her hip was aching worse than ever. She was so sorry Miriam didn't like the material for her new dress. She had tried to please her. She wondered why it was that everything Sally had seemed so much nicer to Miriam than the things she owned.\nWhen she went into the living room, her husband looked up. He was in his favorite chair, and the lamp was soft above his rumpled brown hair. Lucy dropped a little kiss in the middle of it, and he smiled pleasantly.\n\"I thought you'd never get home. I'm practically famished.\"\nLucy smoothed down her fair waves before the round mirror over the buffet and there was a little frown between her dark brows. \"Ben, I just couldn't find a thing for Ada. I've given her so many umbrellas, hankies and slips that I'm ashamed to give her any more.\"\nShe started to undo one of the packages she had brought into the room, but Ben put out his hand.\n\"What do you say we wait until some other time, dear? I've got to slip down to the office right after we eat.\"\nLucy limped a little as she went into the kitchen. All the pleasure and excitement of her shopping trip were slipping away. She sighed as she caught sight of the cabinet. Link had had a snack after school. The peanut butter jar was open, the bread unwrapped. She thought impatiently: \"Miriam might have cleared that mess away before she went to dress.\"\nShe tied a bright, organdy apron over her frock and cleared the sink. Then she started dinner. Lucy liked things neat. She spent a lot of time over her house and prided herself that she was a good housekeeper. The glasses shone as she carried them into the dining room.\nLeona came in while she was setting the table. Leona was almost nineteen, with her father's clear brown eyes and her mother's soft, fair curls. Right now dissatisfied lines etched the corners of her mobile mouth.\n\"Oh, I wish Christmas was a million miles away,\" she said as she dropped into a chair. \"Nobody knows what I go through at Taylor's.\"\nLeona worked in the office of one of the biggest department stores in the city, and Lucy knew how busy she was. Looking at her as she placed the silver, Lucy saw the same thing in her daughter's face that had been in those on the street cara restlessness that was hard to explain. She knew that Leona and Dave had had another quarrel. Leona wanted to be married before Dave went away. She had her wages at the store, and she could go on living at home. Dave had other ideas. He didn't want to start that way. He said he loved Leona too much to make her suffer.\nLucy sighed. Back in the kitchen she thought about the Christmases of long ago. How secure they had been. How wonderful! She couldn't keep her mind from going back.... She recalled a cold, wintry dawn creeping out of the darkness of the night, excited whispers, the patter of bare feet coming into the bedroom. What expectancy had been in the childish faces. What faith had been in their eyes. Oh, for Christmas as it had been when her children were small!\nNow they were changed. Leona was young and lovely yet there were bitter lines about her eyes and a set smile on her lips. She had lost her little-girl laughter, and appeared hard and brittle. Miriam was fast growing into a petulant, thoughtless young woman, thinking of nothing but clothes and fun. Boys like Link, she thought, her hands cold as she mixed the dough for biscuits, were becoming calloused and hard. Even Ben seemed to think only of his stomach. Perhaps rationing was to blame for that. He had followed her into the kitchen and was poking into the refrigerator.\n\"Um,\" he said, licking his finger.\nLucy rescued the vanilla pudding and frowned reprovingly. \"Honestly, Ben, you don't let me get in the door before you start yelling for something to eat.\"\nBen cupped her chin in his palms and studied her flushed features. \"Have a good time downtown?\"\nShe pulled her face indignantly away. \"I just wish you'd do the shopping, Ben Henderson. You seem to think Christmas is fun.\"\n\"Well, isn't it?\" challenged Ben with a teasing grin.\nFeeling the way she did, Lucy wasn't sure. \"Fun for children,\" she admitted reluctantly. She had just finished her housecleaning. Remembering all the woodwork she had scrubbed, all the curtains she had hung, her wrongs rose within her. \"I have to see to everything,\" she complained. \"Link wanted something for the school tree. I had to go to three stores. Miriam is disappointed in her new dress.\"\nBen sat on the stepladder stool and pushed his feet through the rungs. There was a look in his eyes. \"I suppose it isn't like Sally's,\" he said.\nLucy had to smile. But the worried light remained in the depths of her eyes. \"I'm sure I don't know how I'm going to find the time to make it. Tomorrow, I'm going to get out the decorations.\"\n\"Oh, let 'em go,\" said Ben carelessly, as he pushed open the door and disappeared into the living room. \"Or let Link put them up.\"\nLucy poured milk into a pitcher with angry hands. That seemed to be her family's cry, nowadays. Let someone else do it. If you wanted things done right, you must do them yourself. Couldn't Ben understand that it was important how the house looked when Iris came?\nShe found a cloth and went into the hall to wipe up the snow. Bending made her hip ache again, and she looked tired as she carried the plates into the dining room.\nLink had come in and was lying in the middle of the floor where she had to step around him, looking at the funnies in the newspaper. He had shed his cap by tossing it over a candlestick on the buffet. The sleeves of his jacket were hooked across the back of a dining room chair.\n\"Link,\" said Lucy sharply, \"I thought I asked you to clean the walks.\"\nLink looked lazily out of the darkening windows. A few thistlelight snowflakes were touching the glass. \"No sense cleaning walks when it's going to snow,\" he said, and turned back to his paper.\nLucy bit her lip as she carried his jacket and cap to the hall closet. That seemed to be Link's philosophy of life. No sense watering the lawn when it was going to rain. No sense raking leaves when it was going to blow. Suddenly, in Lucy's mind, Link seemed very selfish and very lazy.\nHe was chuckling at Flip Corkin when Lucy came back into the room. \"Whee!\" he chortled, pointing to a falling, flaming plane. \"That's just what those enemy bombers and planes deserve.\"\nNot even Christmas, thought Lucy wearily, could make her son's thoughts of peace, good-will toward men.\nIn the middle of dessert Link stopped eating long enough to say: \"Oh, Maw, did you get the tree?\"\nLucy appealed to Ben. \"You were to attend to that.\"\nBen flushed. \"I forgot,\" he confessed, then added placatingly: \"I'll get it tomorrow. There's still plenty of time.\"\nPlenty of time, agreed Lucy silently, if they were to be content with a spindling little thing that they'd be ashamed of. Pictures of the sort of trees Iris had always been used to rose before her eyes and made her voice sharp. \"Please see to it first thing in the morning.\"\nLink seemed to sense her exasperation, and he looked up and grinned. \"Gee, Maw! Any ole tree's all right if it's got a star at the top.\"\n\"I want a nice one,\" said Miriam insistently. \"You should see the one Sally's got. It must be nine feet tall.\"\nLucy winced, and Ben winked at her.\nLeona yawned as she left the table. \"What difference does it make?\" she asked rather bitterly. \"We're all adults, or aren't we?\"\nAs Lucy carried the dishes into the kitchen, Leona's words rang in her ears. Leona had meant: \"What difference does anything make, any more?\" Lucy's heart ached for her daughter. She wanted to see her happy and gay again.\nBen came into the kitchen as she was hanging up her dishtowel. He had his overcoat over his arm and he stopped in surprised chagrin. \"I thought Miriam was helping you.\"\nLucy hid her face as she put away the cups. \"She and Sally went to the movies,\" she said.\nBen frowned, started to speak, then slipped his arms into his coat sleeves. He didn't look at her. \"I'd have helped if I'd known,\" he told her.\nLucy kissed the end of his nose as she buttoned his coat. When she walked with him to the door, her lips were smiling. \"It doesn't matter, Ben,\" she said sincerely. \"I like to do it.\"\nShe really did. Perhaps that was why the girls were such bad housekeepers. Miriam and Leona had a way of leaving odds and ends undone. Lucy liked to have a neat kitchen. Her eyes twinkled. \"I can't imagine what sort of Christmas we'd have if I let the girls attend to it.\"\nNow she was really laughing and she added teasingly: \"And I shudder to think of the gift you'd choose for Ada.\"\nShe didn't know there was anything prophetic in her words. Even when she awoke in the night with the pain in her hip feeling like hot wires inside, she thought she would be all right in the morning. But when she tried to get up, she had to fall back against the pillow with a moan.\nBen, white-lipped and worried, insisted on knowing what the doctor had said. \"Just rest and the heating pad,\" confessed Lucy, \"with vitamin B thrown in.\"\nShe held her breath while the pain came. And went, and then she wailed: \"Oh, Ben, I can't stay in bed. There're a million things to do.\"\nBen's voice was gruff. \"You've done too much already. Just relax, and I'll send up a tray.\"\nShe might not have been quite so acquiescent if her pain hadn't been so severe.\nLink came bearing the tray proudly, scraped toast, thickly sliced orange, lukewarm cocoa. She smiled wanly. \"I hope this won't spoil your Christmas,\" she said.\n\"It won't,\" said Link cheerfully.\nLong after he had gone, Lucy stared at the door. She had been right. Link was hard and callous. Christmas meant very little to him.\nLeona put her head in the doorway as she rushed off to catch her bus. \"I'll get the turkey and you can tell me how to make the dressing.\"\nShe fumbled in her purse for her lipstick and didn't look at her mother as she rouged her lips with the aid of her compact mirror. \"Who knows? Dave may fall for my cooking. If I give him a bang-up meal, he won't think I'm such a debit.\"\nLucy's mouth dropped in amazement. Certainly neither Dave nor any other man would ever fall for Leona's cooking. How many times had she tried to impress her daughter with the fact that keeping house was an art? Now that it was too late, Leona was planning on bowling Dave over with an elaborate Christmas dinner. Lucy's head ached just contemplating it.\nMiriam dropped into her mother's bedroom on her way to school. She had the unwanted silk in her hands and she sat on the bed. \"I just ran over and showed it to Sally. She says it won't be so terrible if I make it by her pattern. I'm going to take it to school and get Miss Robbins to help me cut it out.\"\nLucy had a sort of lost feeling in the pit of her stomach. Miriam was taking sewing at school, but her seams were always so crooked!\nAt lunch time, Ben hurried home from the office to fix the furnace and get her lunch. But he burned the leftover soup and Lucy had to compromise on bread and milk. That night at dinner there was a rumpled napkin on her tray and one of her best cups from the china cabinet in the dining room. It was Miriam who let it slip that they had run out of kitchen china. But later, Link came to report that Dave had done K. P. Duty. He \"had swung a mean dishtowel,\" and according to Link, everything was \"under control.\"\n\"Pop bought the tree and let me help pick out Ada's present,\" said Link as he said goodnight.\nLucy felt relieved when the house settled down to sleep. Things weren't really going as bad as she had imagined they would. Perhaps she'd be up tomorrow.\nBut Hal arrived in the middle of the argument she was having with Ben about it, and vetoed her suggestion. \"I'm the doctor,\" he said, kissing her fondly, and he added as he drew Iris into the room: \"And this is the doctor's wife.\"\nLucy put out her arms. She had meant to kiss her new daughter-in-law, but the hand that touched her fingers was very cool. There was a wary formality in the girl's tone. \"I'm so sorry you're ill, Mrs. Henderson,\" said Iris politely, and her eyes went around the room.\nLucy was painfully conscious of the soiled towel in the middle of her dressing table, of the empty tray on the window seat. She felt sure that the downstairs part of the house was in similar disarray. Iris' first impression of the Henderson menage hadn't been exactly what Lucy had desired; but she tried to comfort herself with a happy thought. \"I'll be up in the morning. Then I'll tidy things up and use the nicest silver. Perhaps she'll think better of us.\"\nBut in the morning her pain was worse. The family declared they could manage. \"Iris can wash the dishes,\" said Hal magnanimously, and Lucy saw the look that came into the girl's pretty face. Iris wasn't used to doing dishes.\n\"Miriam can do them when she gets home from school,\" said Lucy, but Miriam protested. \"I've got to stay and finish my dress. Iris can do them.\" She looked at her brilliant nails. \"Besides, I don't want to chip my polish.\"\nLucy glanced at the exquisite brilliance of Iris' shining nails. She wanted to shake her daughter; but later she heard Iris and Hal in the kitchen. There was a clatter of dishes and the sound of voices. Once when the door swung open, she heard Iris laugh. She didn't sound too terribly unhappy. But, of course, she had Hal, and that, decided Lucy with mother-like devotion, was enough to make any girl laugh like that!\nWhen the family came home the evening passed with a great deal of commotion. The girls kept running in to ask where things were. Lucy's mind was a treadmill of doubt. When Link shoved his rumpled head in at the door, she wanted to ask questions herself. But he just grinned widely, and said: \"Gee, Maw, we trimmed the tree. It's a beaut!\"\nLucy was pleased. So Ben had found a nice one. But trimming it always made such a mess. When Ben came up, she asked what he had done with the boxes.\n\"I just shoved 'em behind the divan,\" he replied and seemed to consider himself so clever that Lucy hadn't the heart to scold.\nJust as she was dropping off to sleep she remembered that Ben hadn't told her what he had bought for Ada. She asked him what it was, leaning up on her elbow to look across at the other bed. He mumbled sleepily and turned over. It didn't matter. A false complacency lulled her to rest.\nChristmas morning dawned as all Christmas mornings should dawn, clear, cold and bright, with a tiny pattern of frost fingers against the windows where the furnace heat hadn't reached. The entire family trooped into Lucy's bedroom and watched her undo her packages. She felt a very gay invalid in a blue, quilted robe, satin mules, and a dash of Link's rather highly scented perfume.\nLater, Ben and Hal made a \"chair\" with their hands and carried her downstairs into the living room while the rest of them opened their presents. There was so much laughter and excitement that for a little while she didn't notice her surroundings. When she did, she suppressed a little gasp. Link had said the tree was a \"beaut\"; but Lucy saw that even the bright, new star on the topmost branch couldn't hide its thin, straggling formation. It was the worst they'd ever had!\nAs Ada untied a bit of red ribbon, Lucy held her breath for she realized what the present was that Ben had picked out. There was a shout of merriment as Ada held up a doll, a long-legged French affair with unreal blonde hair and taffeta ruffles. Link explained: \"It's to put in the middle of your bed.\"\nAda thanked Ben gravely, but her cheeks were flushed. Lucy couldn't help thinking it was a ridiculous gift for an old maid.\nWhen dinner was ready, Leona declared that everyone must help carry in the food. Dave triumphantly bore the turkey in on the platter and Lucy thanked her lucky stars for an automatic gas oven. Ben slid her to the table in a big chair so that she would not have to walk. When grace had been said, the plates were quickly filled.\nLucy thought the turkey was tough, the gravy lumpy, and that the dressing had too much onion in it. But as she watched them eat, she saw that they didn't seem to notice. Dave couldn't get over the fact that Leona had prepared this magic feast with her own small hands, and Lucy didn't remind him of the numerous trips Leona had made to her couch to inquire how to cook the meal.\nWhen Leona cleared away the plates, Dave helped her, and when they came from the kitchen with the dessert, Leona's eyes were shining. When she leaned over to fill her mother's glass, she whispered in her ear: \"It turned the trick, darling. He's willing to take a chance. Says he doesn't want to lose such a good cook.\"\nLucy pressed her daughter's fingers tightly. There were tears in her eyes as she saw Leona's face. The bitterness had fled, only laughter lurked in her smile.\n\"I speak to wash the dishes,\" said Iris loudly when they had finished.\nLucy was startled and her eyes sought her daughter-in-law's hands. The brilliant nail polish was chipped and worn, but Iris didn't seem to care. While the entire party trooped into the kitchen to help, Lucy lay back on the pillows of her divan and looked about her house.\nThe boxes which Ben had shoved behind the divan were beginning to overflow. Evidently, everyone with an unwanted box had thought of the same thing. The wreaths at the windows hung rather lopsidedly on their red ribbon bows. Tin-foil icicles dripped onto the floor under the tree. The evergreens over the fireplace were threatening to tumble down.\nLucy couldn't understand it. Couldn't anyone else see that the living room carpet was littered with bits of string and hundreds of pine needles from the dried-up tree? Couldn't any of them see that nothing was just exactly right?\nLink came into the room, his face smeared with chocolate, and began to tinker with the lights. \"I gotta put in a new globe,\" he told his mother as he hurried away.\nAda came through the living room with a pile of plates for the china cabinet. As she passed her French doll, she put out her hand and touched the pale-green taffeta ruffles. Lucy saw her eyes. They were no longer faded and dull. The doll had brought back her youth.\nThe room was drowsily quiet when Iris came in. Lucy wasn't sure she was beside her until she lifted her lashes and saw her smiling. There was a sort of inner glow in the girl's face, and when Lucy patted the couch, Iris sat down.\n\"This is the nicest Christmas I've ever known,\" she said wistfully, and Lucy saw that the diamond ring she wore was dull with grease and soap.\nSuddenly she touched Lucy's hand. \"Mrs. Henderson,\" she began, and changed it to: \"Mother, Hal and I want you to be the first to know. We're having a baby in July.\"\nFor a moment Lucy didn't move. She wanted to be sure she heard the simple words. Then her fingers tightened about the girl's hand and she drew her close for a happy kiss. \"I'll have to tell Ben,\" she whispered wonderingly.\nBut Ben and Hal were coming into the room, their arms about each other's shoulders. Iris' eyes twinkled mischievously. \"I don't think you'll have to,\" she said, and went into Ben's opened arms.\nLink came back with the globe he had been hunting. It was a moment before he got it screwed in. The others came out of the kitchen and waited breathlessly. Suddenly the tree was a blaze of light. The star at the top gleamed benevolently. Link's voice was filled with glee. \"I told you, Maw. A tree's swell when it's got a star at the top!\"\nEverybody laughed gently, and admired the display. Leona's hand was linked with Dave's brown one, and there was joy in her eyes. Hal had his arm about his wife's slim waist and there was no fear for the future in either of their faces. Miriam wore her crooked-seamed dress with an arrogant air. When she moved, the skirt flared out and she watched it happily. \"It's a lot prettier than Sally's,\" she admitted with a smile.\nBen stood thoughtfully stroking his chin. \"I hope it's a boy,\" he said out of his dreams, and no one laughed.\nDeep in her soul Lucy knew peace. \"Boy, or girl,\" she said teasingly, \"it will be thrilling to be a grandmother.\"\nShe saw very clearly, now, that Link had been right. Christmas is always wonderful if you look at the star! Thoughts on the Prophet Joseph Smith (Continued from page 732) trees be planted and that all houses should be solidly built. Of the charter, which was to govern this city, he wrote: \"The City Charter of Nauvoo is of my own plan and device. I concocted it for the salvation of the Church, and on principles so broad, that every honest man might dwell secure under its protective influence without distinction of sect or party.\" He believed in home manufacture and under his encouragement many manufactories were established, a few are here mentioned: namely, a cabinet manufactory, a rope manufactory, a bakery, a _ bookstore, and bindery, a comb manufactory, a boot and shoe shop, a carpenter and joiner's shop, a library, a blacksmith shop, a brick kiln, a dentist parlor, a spinning wheel manufactory, a millinery and dressmaking shop, and a watch and clockmaker's shop. In an educational way he was instrumental in having established,. The School of the Prophets, The University of Nauvoo, The Nauvoo Seminary, an Institute, common schools and the Nauvoo Manufacturing and Agricultural Society. This man was truly a Prophet of the Living God. The 114th Semi-annual Conference (Continued from page 735) published proceedings will be made widely available to the members of the Church. The presence of the women of the Church was sincerely missed. That which we do without their full participation is always lacking in completeness. If the messages of the 114th Semiannual conference were heeded by the people of the world, or any substantial part of them, there would quickly be restored those conditions of peace and freedom which would enable us to return to some cherished things, and to realize many blessings yet greater than any we have known Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon DECEMBER! 'The month commemorating the birth of the Prince of Peace, finds the sad paradox of a world still at war! The statement of George Lansbury, Britain's pre-war pacifist, is worth pondering that whenever the will to peace becomes mightier than the will to war, we shall have peace. This will is a qualitative, not quantitative, matter. Six years ago far more people desired peace than war; but the advocates of violence prevailed. Women want peace. 'They now have more understanding of world conditions than ever before, and more influence. Their will to peace must be so intense that no effort will be too costly, no price, within the realm of honor, too great to pay for it.

Page 745 EDITORIAL VOL. 30 DECEMBER 1943 NO. 12 The Blessed Refrain THERE seems to be a spirit of love in the very air one breathes at Christmas timea feeling of friendliness, a desire to help others, and a reaching out to those less fortunate. This spirit of true love pervades the air of the Christmas scene much as did the voices of the multitude of heavenly hosts nearly 2000 years ago who, praising God, said: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" To many of the inhabitants of the earth, this year, this message may sound like hollow mockery. Even in this country there will be few families whose circle will not be smaller, lacking the dear presence of some members who may be in grave danger in far-off lands under strange skies, or who may have gone ahead to that eternal land toward which we are all traveling. But to all saints who bear a love of Christ in their hearts and the knowledge that He is the Redeemer of the world, the first fruits of the resurrection, this heavenly enunciation should have added significance. Now especially should one render \"Glory to God in the highest,\" and gratefully echo the refrain, \"and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" One must give \"glory to God\" as much as one in his humble way may\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.\" As a result of this greatest Page 746 gift, as a result of the great sacrifice, there may come to all the inhabitants of the earth that peace which the heavenly hosts proclaimed following the angel's announcement of Christ's birth; the peace of the soul which comes from a knowledge of God's eternal plan and a consciousness that one is living in accordance with His plan; the peace which pervades the soul within and is in nowise dependent upon conditions without; the peace to be found in bringing one's own desires and hopes into harmony with the will of the Father and acknowledging \"the Lord knows best\"; the peace that comes from a ready acceptance of conditions as they affect one from day to day and a willing submission to them; the peace that comes from showing forth love toward one's fellow man even to the extent shown by so many loved ones in this day who stand ready to lay down their lives for their friends; the peace to be found at all times and in all dispensations in the Gospel of Jesus Christ'\"The peace of God which passeth all understanding.\" With this peace in one's heart, of necessity one has good will toward men. Then let not the anxieties, the sorrows of this day obliterate the joy to be found in a true observance of this Christmas and an appreciation of the blessed refrain: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\"M. C. S. - Women and the Church Canning Prog DURING the remarks made by President Clark at the opening session of the 114th semi-annual general conference, he estimated that fifty million cans of food had been preserved by members of the Church in 1943 for family and welfare use. He said:, For this tremendous achievement, the greatest that has come from a_ unified Church effort in a generation, the most credit and gratitude is due to the sisters of the Church who have done all the home canning as well as the bulk of the canning for the Welfare Program and the ward groups. We ask these sisters to receive the heartfelt thanks and congratulations of the whole body of the Church. As the remarks of President Clark were heard by the women members of the Church who were privileged to listen to the conference broadcast, they must have recalled long hours spent in hard work at a welfare cannery or over a hot stove on a summer's day when they had heeded the advice of Church leaders and preserved food for the coming winter. A feeling of satisfaction must also have come to these listeners as they fam visualized the rows of fruit and vegetables preserved for their families' use. Many of the groups who banded together to go to canneries consisted of members of ward and branch Relief Societies and many pressure cookers owned by Relief Societies were utilized by different ward groups. The General Board extends appreciation for the faithfulness and hard work performed by Relief Society members and the women of the Church in general who did so much to make this stupendous canning program a reality. A mother could ask for no greater blessing than to know that her children will not hunger during the coming winter, and to those women who not only provided for their own needs but for others as well, additional blessings will be visited upon them. An editorial in the Deseret News, October 4, 1943 \"Women of the Church, We Pay a Tribute\" honored the women for the part they are playing today both in the Church and nation. M.C.S.

Moyle, Deseret News Garden Editor CHRISTMAS will be made more C joyous and happy for countless sweethearts, wives, and mothers by the gift of some lovely, living plant, blooming in cultivated perfection. Few gifts carry so eloquent a message of love and courage, or say so well that old, old greeting of \"Merry, Merry Christmas,\" of \"Peace on Earth.\" The Christmas plant has now become one of the most popular and treasured of gifts; never are flowers more appreciated than during this loved season when all our thoughts turn to home and loved ones. \"A thing of beauty is a joy forever\" sings the poet, but alas! All too often our pleasure upon receiving such a plant is marred by the sad disappointment of seeing our lovely plant begin to droop and fade, often within a few hours after it is received. Why is it so difficult to keep these beautiful specimens of the professional florist's skill happy and contented in the changed environment of the modern living room? Why must the lovely, flaming poinsettia droop its great handsome leaves and vivid flower in such a discouraging manner? What makes the exquisite cyclamen, with its silken blooms poised like butterflies ready for flight, suddenly wither and become but a ruined shadow of its former glory; and why does that glamorous plant, the azalea, refuse to continue its thrilling show of fluted-petaled flowers and even discard its beautiful glossy foliage? 'These are the Page 748 questions that have puzzled countless recipients of the Christmas gift plant. We seldom stop to consider that the flowering plant has been living in the cool, moist air of the modern greenhouse, and that the change from this humid atmosphere to the hot, dry heat of the modern living room is a severe shock. Here are a few rules for the care of different gift plants. While no two are exactly alike in their requirements, one safe rule can be applied to all: namelydo not place your plant near a hot radiator nor in a too hot or heavily curtained room. Few greenhouse plants can endure the temperatures that we human be- - ings find so comfortable. Drafts, too, are extremely detrimental, and many a well-meaning flower lover will stand a beautiful flowering plant in a draft-swept hallway, thinking that it is just the right place for the plant's well-being, when really it supplies the most harmful conditions. This is especially true of the poinsettia, perhaps the most popular of all Christmas plants. Place your poinsettia in some warm, sunny, draft-free window, after first standing it in a pan of water until moisture shows on the surface of the soil. It should have a warm place which does not go below 70 degrees even at night. A lack of sun, chilling, and too much or too little water are the reasons why the flowers so often droop and fade. Water the plant thoroughly, using luke-warm water, CARE OF THE CHRISTMAS GIFT PLANT then wait until it begins to dry out slightly on the surface before again _ applying a generous drink. When the poinsettia begins to droop, after its flowers are all over, its resting time has come. Give it less and less water and remove it to some cool spot, the basement is ideal, where it can be given just enough occasional watering to keep the roots alive. When spring comes, cut your plant back to four inches and repot, using fresh garden loam, sand, and leaf mold or mountain soil of equal parts. Sink the pot outside in some spot where it can receive regular watering and soon it will begin to grow again. Be sure to bring the plant indoors before cold weather, and it will bloom again in time for the holiday season. HE azalea is becoming better known each year, and now rivals the poinsettia in popularity. This exquisite plant can now be purchased in sizes all the way from a small plant in a five-inch pot to the great specimen tree producing hundreds of lovely blooms. Should you be the fortunate recipient of one of these gorgeous flowering plants, do find a really cool spot for it. A sun parlor with indirect heat is ideal, but lacking this, place it in a cool window facing east or north. The azalea demands copious watering, twice each day not being too much. Some successful house-plant growers even keep the pot in a pail of water for a while each day. The roots of this plant are formed in a hard mat, and often the home gardener fails to give enough moisture to penetrate this hard mass. The foliage and stems of the plant should also 749 be sprayed or sprinkled often. Continue to give constant and plenty of moisture after the flowering period is over and remove the faded buds to prevent the seeds from maturing. If your plant begins to fade or look sick, give it a dose of the acid content which it needsone-half teaspoonful of aluminum sulphate in a quart of water, and apply gradually. When good weather arrives, the azalea should be put outside, sinking the pot in a hole and filling up with peat moss which is sold by nurserymen and florists. Water the plant with one-half teaspoonful of any good commercial fertilizer in a quart of water every two or three weeks, and when fall comes, remove the plant to the house, and it will again put out its lovely crop of bloom. Some local house-plant fans keep azalea plants flowering year after year with such treatment.\nThe cyclamen is another favorite plant. This grows from a central corm or bulb, much like a gladiolus, and it, too, needs a great deal of moisture, but beware of allowing water to reach the central bulb from which the delicate fleshy stems grow. The best method of watering the cyclamen is to stand the pot in a shallow bucket of warm water for an hour, then drain the water off before placing the plant back on the saucer on which it stands. Never, never, allow water to stand in the saucer under the plant, and if the leaves or stems wither, jerk them sharply away from the bulb before they begin to rot, for this may spread to the bulb itself. Do not expect to keep the cyclamen happy in your living room, but place it in some really cool, light window, which faces east so as to avoid full sun. If you can keep the cyclamen cool enough, it will go on opening its abundant supply of buds for weeks, and may even develop new ones.\nWe are all familiar with the cheery little Jerusalem cherry plant with its gay Christmas colors of red and green, but sad to tell, this dainty plant usually presents problems to keep it from dropping all its leaves soon after it comes into our overheated homes, for this plant considers 50 degrees a comfortable temperature in which to display its bright berries. If you receive this plant for Christmas, place it at once in your coldest north window, and spray and sprinkle the leaves several times each day to supply the moisture which it craves. The pepper plant with its oblong berries that are found in all stages of growth and coloring, endures a warm room much better than does the Jerusalem cherry, but it, too, needs the same constant care of watering and spraying. A daily bath and plenty of moisture it must have in order to be happy.\nOne other plant is grown extensively in local nurseries for Christmas time, the improved begonia semperflorens. Grandmother grew this plant in her kitchen window, but how the modern plant wizards have glamoured it and made it sparkle! The plants we enjoy today are a dazzling mound of vivid color with the flowers almost obliterating the foliage. If you can find just the right conditions for this plant, it will go on blossoming for you all winter, and you can take cuttings from it for planting out in your garden in the spring where they will continue their amazing flowering week after week. Place the plant, during the summer, in your coolest window which has sun, but guard against allowing the hot midday sun to strike it through the glass. This plant, too, needs plenty of moisture, but should not be kept sopping wet, just constantly moist.\nTo keep these flowering plants in bloom is no easy task, as you can see, but it is well worth taking the time to give each plant somewhat the conditions it needs, for nothing gives a home such a gay and happy note as do a few blossoming flowers, especially when ice and snow are in command on the other side of the window pane."

            "content": "Christmas on Tubuai in 1851 Nettie Hunt Rencher\nMy grandmother, Louisa Barnes Pratt, was the first woman to be called to fill a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In conference in Salt Lake City on the 6th of April, 1850, she received her call. When President Brigham Young set her apart for this work, he made her many wonderful promises which were literally fulfilled. Her mission was to the women and children of the South Sea Islands. She and her family of four daughters left Salt Lake City on the 7th of May, 1850, in company with ten missionaries, some of whom took their families. Louisa's husband, Addison Pratt, had preceded her eight months before. She made the long journey of one thousand miles by land, and five thousand miles by water in safety, as she had been promised. Five and a half months being required to make the journey. Her eldest daughter, a young lady nearly nineteen years of age, learned the language very easily, and acted as interpreter for her mother until she had mastered the language. Being born and reared in Massachusetts, Louisa had a splendid education for that day and time. She had taught school in the States, in Canada, Nauvoo, Winter Quarters, and Salt Lake City, and was now to continue her teaching in the Islands. She did a great work among the women and children of Tubuai, where she spent most of her time. She kept a journal a good deal of her life, and all the time while on her mission, the first entries being made more than one hundred years ago. It is from this journal that the story of \"Christmas on Tubuai in 1851\" is taken, given in her own words:\nWhen Christmas was drawing near, I called the Native Sisters around me and told them of the nearing event. We had taught them of the Savior's life and mission. I told them we would have a big celebration, and of course a great feast, as no affair was complete without a feast. They were all very much pleased. First I told them we must clean the large room used for church services, or angels would not minister unto us, for they take no delight in filth. So we took sand and scoured the benches and floor, to the delight of the native women who had not witnessed anything of the kind before. Now began our decorating. In the center of the room was a large pillar supporting the roof. On either side I placed an ito tree, of the most livid green, extending almost to the roof; to these I attached tea leaves, of which the females make wreaths because of their bright color, and pleasant odor. Added to these the bright fresh flowers of the bouran tree scattered about among the branches forming a pleasing contrast of lively green and yellow. Overhead and around the entire room, I hung boughs, flowers and branches of the lime tree with the fruit on. I had with me a picture of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum; these I hung on the wall. The native Saints regard them with great reverence. Then we invited our Church members and intimate friends. The natives gathered from far and near; thronged around the house, looking in at the windows, admiring the decorations. I felt annoyed and asked the chief to send them away. He plead for them, as a father would for children, saying they had never seen anything like it before. Would I not indulge them this once, next time they should be sent (Continued on page 760)"

Reuben Clark, Jr.\nAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man (Luke 2:40-52).\nITHE JOURNEY FROM NAZARETH TO JERUSALEM\nIt was a spring day at the end of March (near the middle of the seventh Hebrew month, Nisan), the fields were yellowing with the ripening crops, the hills and valleys were covered with wild flowers, all nature rejoiced, as Joseph and Mary and Jesus, their kinsfolk and neighbors, left Nazareth with its white rocks and cliffs, splotched with green, and started down through the foothills to the valley floor of the plain of Jezreel, one thousand feet below. They were going to Jerusalem to observe the Passover, as had been their wont over the years, in obedience to the Rabbinical law, commending (and in certain instances requiring) the observance of the feast in Jerusalem by the Levitically clean males of Israel. The women were not legally bound to attend. The feast was a jubilee of great rejoicing for it marked the anniversary of Israel's delivery from a grievous bondage to the Egyptians, and also her birth as a nation.\nThis journey has particular significance because it is the first appearance of Jesus in the sacred record, following His return with Mary and Joseph, to Nazareth from Egypt. After this appearance, there is another silence of eighteen years about Jesus, when being about thirty years old, He appears on the banks of the Jordan to be baptized of John. While history is silent about those first twelve years, we may reasonably know what His life was like. Joseph was a carpenter, and Jesus was undoubtedly learning the trade, for years after, when friends and neighbors for the second time rejected Him from Nazareth, they asked: \"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary...?\" But \"From the first days of its existence, a religious atmosphere surrounded the child of Jewish parents.\"? This would come first from the mother, but the father was under a sacred obligation to teach his son. At the age of five or six the child was sent to school, where he began a regular course, the Bible being the exclusive textbook until the boy was ten years of age. This Bible study began with Leviticus, then passed to the other parts of the Pentateuch, thence to the Prophets, and thence to the Hagiographa,that portion of the Bible not in the law and the prophets. From ages ten to fifteen, the child studied the Mishnah, or traditional law. When he reached the academies of the Rabbis he studied the Gemara or Talmud, but a boy might not enter these till he was fifteen. We have no means of knowing whether or not Jesus attended one of these schools, but the astonishment of the doctors in the Temple over His learning would indicate He had received from somewhere, most unusual and profound wisdom and knowledge. But at twelve years, a boy became a \"son of the law,\"? subject to the fasts and under obligation to attend the feasts. So as these pilgrims wended downward over the foothills in the afternoon (in Palestine the first day of the journey was always a short one), they were a joyous group, chanting as they went the \"Psalms of Ascent\" (Psalms 120-134), to the accompaniment of a flute.?\nAs we think of them moving slowly down into the valley with their donkeys laden with necessary supplies, picking their way among the boulders that strewed the path, we cannot escape wondering what were the thoughts of Jesus. That He was exceeding wise, the experience in the Temple shows. But was this wisdom earthborn from His studies, or did He have also a spiritual memory that brought to Him a recollection of all that had before happened, and a vision to show what was thereafter to happen along this road to Jerusalem, a road richer in incidents of God's dealings with his children, than any other road on the face of the earth?\nAs to memory of the past, we do know that during His later Judean ministry, while speaking to the Jews in the treasury to the Temple, He declared: \"I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.... I speak that which I have seen with my Father.\"? And out on the Mount of Olives, after they had left the Passover Chamber, on the night before the crucifixion, Jesus said to His apostles: \"For all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\"? Thus in His later ministry, His mind was filled with knowledge gained in His pre-existence.\nWe do not know the details of their journey to Jerusalem, but they may well have stopped the first night at Nain, where later He raised the son of the widow;? or if the start were early enough they might have gone on to Jezreel, once the second capital of the northern kingdom. One wonders if, as He came to Nain, He saw a vision of His future miracle of kindness there. And here we may recall that in pre-vision He said to Peter in the Passover Chamber, answering Peter's protestations of faithfulness: \"I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.\"?\nWhen He came to the neighborhood of Jezreel, did He see in vision the disastrous defeat of Josiah on the plain of Esdraelon by Pharaoh Necho, at Megiddo, a defeat so terrible and worked so deeply into the Hebrew heart, that John speaks of the great last battle as Armageddon\"the hill of Megiddo?\" Or did He see the earlier conflict in the time of the Judges, when Barak, Deborah the prophetess guiding, defeated Sisera, leading the forces of Jabin, on that same plain of Esdraelon, and did He see again the deed of Jael afterwards? And did there also come before Him the iniquities and tragic fate of Ahab and Jezebel, and the Lord's vengeance worked through Elijah against the priests of Baal, and the flight of Elijah to Carmel, the passing of the Lord before Elijah in the \"still small voice\"? For Jesus was the Lord who spoke to and commanded His ancient prophets.\nBut wherever the first night was spent, the start the next morning was early. They now moved on Roman roads, as they passed on southwards towards the city of Samaria. Crossing the headwaters of the River Kishon (which waters and drains the plains of Esdraelon), they would begin the ascent of the pass over the Carmelite range, the hill slopes probably covered with the yellow flowers of the broom. Villages dotted the high points along the way. They found rich orchards and vineyards on the summit and as they looked around them they could catch, here and there, glimpses of the Mediterranean (off to the west) and looking back to the north, they could see the snowy summit of Mount Hermon. Over to the left as they climbed up the pass, they had seen the rugged volcanic mountains of Gilboa, at the foot of which was fought the great battle between Saul and the Philistines, and where Saul killed himself. To the northeastward was Endor, the place where the witch lived whom Saul consulted, the Lord having failed to direct him, \"neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\"?\nAs they went forward over the undulating pass, they crossed a part of the plain of Dothan,? where Joseph was sold to the Ishmaelites.? Finally, passing the summit, they descended by easy grades to the city of Samaria, located on an isolated hill 300 feet above the surrounding country.? Samaria was the next capital of the northern tribes after Shechem. It had been frequently destroyed but now as Jesus came to it, it was a great city, rebuilt by Herod the Great, with magnificent palaces, temples, and a stadium. The plain surrounding the city was exceedingly fertile, covered with orchards of figs and olives. Its beauty and its future provoked Isaiah to speak of its \"glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer.\"? But here in the years long gone, before this visit, there had been planted a grove of Astarte (Venus), and Jezebel had erected a great temple to that same heathen goddess.? Elisha had lived at the foot of the hill on which the city rested;? and to this house came Naaman, the Syrian leper, to be healed. Elisha dwelt here when he disclosed to Ahab the plans of the Syrian generals. Here, when Benhadad the Syrian besieged it, was the scene of the great famine, so sore it was that women ate their own sons.\nWhat must have been the feelings of the young Jesus as He looked at this present magnificence and then recalled the past, and (it seems it must be) visioned the future!\nAs the pilgrims went forward they were joined by others also going to the Passover in Jerusalem. On through the day, as newcomers flowed into the group, they renewed, time and again, the chant of the \"Psalms of the Ascent.\" They lived over again in thought and story how here the Lord had blessed them and delivered them from Egyptian bondage. But of all the throng, no one but He Himself knew that that Lord traveled with them, for we must believe there was with Him a spiritual recollection, a divine knowledge, of the past.\nWhether they stopped at Samaria or went on two hours further to Shechem, we do not know. But they were traveling over historic ground that reached in incident clear back to Abraham. They may, because of the prejudice against the Samaritans, have so planned their journey as to pass through Samaria in one day. But we cannot tell.\nAs they came into the midst of Shechem itself, they came to the very spot where the waters divided, those flowing to the west into the Great Sea, those to the east into the Jordan. The city lies where the two mountains, Ebal and Gerizim, falling away one from the other, leave a beautiful, fertile valleythe very cradle of Israel. To this valley, running out west and east from the city, came Abraham and Lot, forsaking at the Lord's command their own country under a promise that this land should be theirs.? Here lived Jacob and his family; Jacob whose name was here changed to Israel.? Here Joshua gathered the people and had them repeat the curses and blessings declared by Moses in the wildernessReuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali to stand upon Mount Ebal for the curses, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin to stand on Mount Gerizim for the blessings, the Levites repeating the curses and the people shouting amen.? Here was consummated the rebellion which divided Israel, after which Jeroboam built Shechem, and brought about the return of idolatry to Israel.? Here in the immediate area was Joseph's tomb;? at the eastern foot of the valley is the traditional site of the oak of Abraham, beneath which he built an altar,\" \"the first sanctuary to Jehovah in the Promised Land,\"\" and later Joshua built there 721 an altar \"under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the Lord.\"\" Near to the site of this sanctuary is Jacob's well. On the top of Mount Ebal, Joshua placed the stones on which he had written the Law.\" The Samaritans believed the stones were atop Mount Gerizim.\" On the top of this mountain the Samaritans held their Passover feast,\" and the woman of Samaria, years later, said to Jesus at Jacob's well near the foot of Gerizim: \"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain\"; to which Jesus replied: \"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.\"\" The Samaritans claimed that to this mountain Abraham came to offer Isaac as a sacrifice.* As Jesus looked at all these, probably for the first time with His mortal eyes, there must have crowded in upon His consciousness the scenes of the actual events. The divinity that was in Him must have reached back into the past even as, when later in His ministry, after the first Passover, He traveled northward through Samaria and stopped at the well to get a drink from the Samaritan woman drawing water from the well, He reached into the past of this sinful woman. As He taught her, and she understood not, He said: ''Go, call thy husband, and come hither.\" \"T have no husband,\" said she. \"Thou hast well said, I have no husband,\" He replied. \"For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband.\" If the 25/ Geikie, p. 489. 26/Gen. 12. 27/ Gen. 32:28; 33:18. 28/ Joshua 8:32; Deut. 27. 29/1 Kings 12; id 12:25. 476. 33/ Joshua 24:26. 30/ Joshua 24:32. 34/ Deut. 27:4 ff. 35/ Geikie, p. 483. 31/ Gen. 12:6 ff A.

And did He vision, as at twelve He now first beheld the well mortally, the future meeting with the woman and His sermon on the living water?\" But whether the pilgrims stopped at Samaria or at Shechem, or whether before they reached there or after, yet as they went on towards Jerusalem along the Roman road, they passed constantly the places where other great happenings in Israel's history took place. About halfway, going southward, between Shechem and Bethel lies Shiloh. It was here that Joshua came with the Tabernacle and Ark after he left Gilgal, and it was here that he cast lots for the division of the Promised Land among the tribes.\" It was from Shiloh that the Benjamites (following the terrible punishment inflicted upon them by Israel for the abuse of the concubine of the Levite), stole the dancing virgins for wives. Here lived Eli and here was trained Samuel; and to Shiloh came the Philistines, and defeated the sons of Eli and carried off the Ark.\" As the group moved southward from Shiloh towards Bethel, there would likely come to them, increasingly as they neared Jerusalem (for under the Rabbinical law every male Jew over twelve years living within fifteen miles of Jerusalem was obliged to attend the Passover),\" other pilgrims to the Temple and the great feast. And ever as they marched forward over the Roman highway, they would be chanting the sacred Psalms. On the right, to the westward, shortly after the group left Shiloh, lay the old Ephraimite Gilgal, whence went Elijah and Elisha on their way to the Jordan before Elijah was taken into Heaven.\" From a hill at the side of a wild pass a little farther south, they could look back and still see Mount Hermon with its cap of snow.\" As they went down the other side of the pass, they traveled through great orchards of fig trees and olives. This was the rich tertitory of Ephraim.\" And then came Bethel, a great sanctuary. Abraham came to Bethel from Shechem, and again after his return from Egypt. On his first visit he built an altar, to which he returned after Egypt. It was here that Israel assembled when they determined to war on Benjamin for the violation of the concubine of the Levite.\" It was here also that, after the rebellion of the Ten Tribes, Jeroboam set up one of the two golden calves he made for them to worship, the other calf went to Dan.\" One can but wonder how shallow must have been Israel's conversion to the true God, to be so easily turned back to Egyptian idolatry. Jehu left the calf though he rooted out Baal,\" but Josiah broke down the altar and \"stamped it small to powder.\"\" To the west and slightly to the south of Bethel, was Ai, and still 40/ John 4:7 ff. 41/ Joshua 18 ff. 42/ Judges 19, 21. 43/1 Sam. 4:10 ff. 44/ Geikie, p. 183. 45/II Kings 2. 46/ Geikie, p. 468. 47/ Geikie, p. 467. 48/ Gen. 12:7; 13:4. 49/ Judges 20:17. 50/1 Kings 12:28 ff. 51/II Kings 10:24 ff. 52/II Kings 23:15. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS further south, Ramah and Gibeon. Between these two latter Joshua fought the great battle against the Amorites, when, the day waning, without time to finish his victory that great warrior cried out, \"In the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.... So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.' The growing group was now near Michmash, too, close to where Jonathan with only his armorbearer put to rout the Philistines, for Jonathan had said: \"It may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.'\" Still nearer to Jerusalem was Gibeah, the site of the shameful deed of Benjamin, and the home and headquarters of Saul while he was king.\" The pilgrims were now in the environs of Jerusalem. If they reached there just before the Passover, they found the roads choked with the tens of thousands who were coming to the City of David to attend the feast, bringing with them their burnt and peace offerings, for none might appear empty. In Jesus' time as many as 256,000 lambs were slain for the Passover. The population of the city at Passover time varied from 2,500,000 to 3,000,000. Many who came camped outside the city; others found quarters within the city walls with friends or relatives who hospitably took them in, the guests leaving, as they took their departure, 53/ Joshua 10:6 ff. 723 \"the skins of the Passover lambs and the vessels they had used in their sacred services\"; still others went to neighboring towns, Bethpage and Bethany being mentioned in the Talmud as especially hospitable. The shouts of greeting that passed between old friends again meeting; the chanting of the sacred psalms by the coming worshipers keyed to a high pitch by their long journey of anticipation, their presence in the city of the fathers, the nearness of the Passover, and the gratitude for their ancient deliverance; the lowing of the cattle brought for burnt offerings; the bleating of the sacrificial lambs; the cooing of the doves for peace offeringsall must have mingled into a babel of sound never to be forgotten, and heard from afar it must have been like the roar of a distant waterfall. We must believe that Joseph and Mary, and the youth Jesus, of the royal lineage of David, had awaiting them somewhere a joyous welcome from friends honored in the chance to give them food and shelter. One cannot escape the question whether they went on to Bethany, eastward of Jerusalem, for their lodgings, to the home where in the years to come Jesus spent so many happy hours in an abode that loved and honored Him. Did the youth Jesus know the youth Lazarus, and the maidens, Mary and Martha? Or did they go to Bethlehem, where twelve years before the Messiah was born in a manger?

Places Jesus Loved Elder Thomas Cottam Romney President of the Central States Mission PALESTINE, or as it is frequently called, the Holy Land, is the most charming bit of territory in the entire world to the followers of Christ. There are countries more picturesque if by that term is meant mountain peaks whose castellated formations pierce the azure to dizzy heights with peaceful lakes nestling at their feet; go to Switzerland for such. If, however, you long for gently rolling hills and peaceful countryside and shady lanes, visit England and feast upon her beauty and dream of romance. But if you want to feel the thrill which comes from standing on holy ground, consecrated and sanctified by the life and sacred blood of the Master, make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. As you approach the Jordan River from the east, you will be breathless with emotion, not of the hilarious type, but the deep, reverential emotion such as one would experience if he were approaching the sacred precincts of a holy temple. A feeling akin to that felt by Moses as he came upon the burning bush out of which he heard the voice of Jehovah commanding: \"... Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground;\" or even that which almost overcame Israel as they came near the sacred Mount of Sinai amid the thunderings of that holy mountain. Follow the Jordan to where it enters the Sea of Galilee from the north and you will witness, as you behold that expanse of water, one of the most enchanting pictures Page 724 of all of the multifarious designs etched by Mother Nature to please the artistic taste of man. No place in Palestine was more loved by Jesus than the Sea of Galilee. It was here around the borders of this inland sea that His time was chiefly spent in preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. It was from the fishing boats so abundant on the bosom of the lake in those days that the Master invited Peter and Andrew his brother and James and John, the sons of Zebedee, to leave their nets and come and follow Him \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" 'To the publican Levi or Matthew, who sat at the receipt of customs in the city of Capernaum he said: \"Follow me. And he arose and followed him.\" It was here that Jesus wrought His first miracle, if we -accept the testimony of the synoptic writers. In the synagogue at Capernaum on the Sabbath Day a man with an unclean spirit cried out: \"... What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth...? And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.\" And the evil spirit obeyed. The landscape of Galilee has remained unchanged throughout the centuries since the Savior looked upon it, save for the thriving cities nestled around its shores. All have disappeared but one and that is Tiberius, a gentile city whose origin antedated the birth of Christ by a quarter of a century.

These ruins forcibly remind us of the prophetic nature of the Son of God when he declared: \"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which were done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.\" \"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works, which were done - in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\" Speaking of the thriving conditions around the shores of Galilee and its environs in the days of Christ, Dr. Fosdick says: 725 Here in the Master's time ran trunk roads, with busy traffic passing to and fro and tax gatherers sitting at the customhouses to collect the tolls. Here were cities which he could compare with Tyre, Sidon and Nineveh and from which, as public attention centered in him, a great multitude followed him and they thronged him.... Here on the shores were fleets of fishing boats, and on the shores, miles of nets to be dried and mended. Everywhere about the lake the Master moved in the midst of populous, opulent, cosmopolitan life where a man might gain the whole world and lose his soul and where at times the exacting throng so wearied him that he had to go apart and rest awhile. Contrast the present desolate appearance with such a picture of prosperity; but, aside from the dearth of population, the scene remains unchanged. As Mrs. Romney and I approached the sea from the north, we observed that the great profusion of flowers brought forth by the late 726 winter rains had disappeared and the grasses had turned to a deep brown under the persistent heat of the Palestinian sun. Yet there were colors in the landscape of a never-ending variety, from the deep green shades of the trees and brush to the purple colorings on the flank of the precipitous hills that rise sheer from the eastern shore of the Sea of Gallilee. Below, in front of us, we saw the placid waters of Galilee. Scarcely a tipple was to be seen on its bosom, so much in contrast to the picture portrayed by the synoptic writers in which we behold the Master stilling the tempest to save the lives of certain of His disciples exposed to the turbulence of the waves. Here in this body of water is typified the lesson of contrast. The water so calm and peaceful at one moment, in the course of a brief period may be a fury of waves capable of dashing into pieces the fisherman's sturdiest boat. Such was the testimony of a Palestinian who understood the fitful nature of this inland sea. While fish caught from the lake were being prepared for the midday meal, we were seeking respite from the oppressive heat by imbibing ice-cold soda pop and by fanning ourselves beneath the shade of trees adjacent to the edge of the lake. Not a breath of. Air seemed to reach us from the heights abovethe sea was a dead calm and not a leaf or blade of grass stirred, so still was the atmosphere about us. And yet, there was a fascination about this place, nearly seven hundred feet below the level of the sea. Perhaps it came from a knowledge that the Master had consecrated its shores with His divine presence and bathed His tired feet in its cooling waters. But robbed of its sacred historic connotations, it still would have a deep and abiding fascination for the tourist. The blueness of the water, the precipitous character of the limestone hills rising from the water's brink, the scattered thorn bushes all around the shore, and the blue sky overhead combined to produce a picture in nature which once seen, can never be forgotten. THE journey to Nazareth, twenty-five miles to the southwest, took us through the village of Cana where Jesus turned the water into wine at the marriage feast. Had we taken time, the very jars in which the water stood would have been pointed out to us, and maybe a sip of the wine would have been tendered us were we gullible enough to purchase it. Nazareth, the boyhood home of Jesus, is beautifully situated in a little valley and in the southern folds of the Galilean hills. From one of the highest points of the village can be seen the blue waters of the Mediterranean through a V-shaped valley off to the west. Upon this scene, no doubt, the Master as a youth was wont to gaze times without number. And down below was the plain of Esdraelon stretching from Mount Carmel on the west, to the Jordan on the east. Over this plain for thousands of years had been heard the tramp of footsteps of millions of fighting men from many parts of the world as they marched forth to battle. The clank of the sabre, and the whir of the chariot had been mingled with the groans and the shrieks of the dying as the soil drank the blood PLACES JESUS LOVED 727 Courtesy of President Joseph Jacobs. THE WAILING WALL AT JERUSALEM of myriads slain from Egypt and Assyria, from Babylonia and Syria, from the land of the Hittites and from Philistia and Moab. Caravans laden with goods from many parts of the world likewise used this plain as a thoroughfare of travel. Six miles from Nazareth, en route to Jerusalem, we passed on our left Nain, where Jesus raised to life the widow's son. A little farther on we beheld beautiful Mount Tabor with its symmetrical proportions rounded off like a hemisphere and covered with groves of oak and terebinths. Tradition points strongly to this Mount as being the scene of the transfiguration of Christ \"... And his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.\" Near the ancient city of Shechem we passed by the tomb of Joseph who was sold into Egypt and nearby was the traditional \"deep well\" from which Jesus was given water by the Samaritan woman. As we approached the city of Jerusalem from the north, we beheld a city sprawled over a desert area uninviting save to those who see beauty in an arid region. But to me, familiar with desert areas, there is a fascination and an allurement not to be met with elsewhere. The only natural source of water is an intermittent spring in the valley of Kidron insufficient to supply the city's needs. Cisterns have therefore been excavated from time immemorial for rain storage, and water has been led to the city by conduits from external sources, some of them far distant. Before entering the city, we could not refrain from visiting the Mount of Olives, a brief span to the east of Jerusalem. Over this Mount Jesus rode on His triumphant march into Jerusalem, and wept over the city as it came into view. Daily He must have passed over it during the time He lodged at the home of Mary and Martha before His trial and crucifixion. On its slope was probably the fig tree that He cursed and, at its foot and up its western slope was the Garden of Gethsemane where Christ was betrayed. It was likely on this Mount also that He gave His great eschatological discourse on the destruction of the Temple and the besiegement of Jerusalem in which He depicted the horrors which should overtake the Jewish people. And it was from here that He made His ascension into heaven.\nThe altitude of the spot on which we stood was 2637 feet above the level of the sea and 200 feet higher than the Temple mount. Toward the east and southeast we looked down into the very bowels of the earth, it seemed, and saw the Jordan River with its banks lined with trees and shrubs. We had a clear vision of the river to the point where it empties its water into the Dead Sea and, still farther on, we beheld that great inland body of salt water whose surface is 1300 feet below the Mediterranean. It was in the desert region to the west of the Dead Sea that Christ is believed to have spent His forty days in fasting, when tempted of the Devil.\nJerusalem has a population of more than 100,000. A portion of the city is new and splendid in all of its appointments while the old portion is much the same as it was when the Master trod its streets. The full-length, sombre gowns of the womenfolk as well as their headgear are reminiscent of the days of long ago when the Man of Galilee moved about the streets of this sacred metropolis. The camels and asses that thread the streets bearing burdens of merchandise and human freight could well be the progeny of remote ancestry that bore the burdens of Melchizedek, king and great high priest of Jerusalem, and his subjects at the time of the visit of Father Abraham on his way southward following the rescue of his kidnapped nephew Lot.\nOn the traditional spot where the temples of Solomon and Herod stood is the Dome of the Rock, one of the most impressive mosques of the Near East. Immediately under the Dome is a huge rock from which the mosque gets its name. On this rock is the imprint of what appears to be a human foot, the reputed footprint made by Mohammed at the time of his ascension into heaven. Near the Dome of the Rock is the Jewish Wailing Wall and to this spot come thousands of Jews yearly to pour out their souls in anguish in contemplation of the many disasters that have beset their race and with a prayer on their lips that the long period of exile from this promised land will soon end.\nBethlehem, where Jesus was born, is about six miles to the south of Jerusalem. It is beautifully situated on a ridge running east and west and commanding a splendid view of the surrounding country. The hills were somewhat more rugged than I had expected to see them and yet there was a peaceful beauty and quaintness about the whole landscape that was entrancing. The most interesting place in Bethlehem is the Church of the Nativity built by order of Constantine 330 A. D. at the suggestion of his mother, Helena. Within the Church is a star bearing the inscription, \"Here Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary.\" About this spot hang costly lamps of gold and silver belonging to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Armenian Churches. While we rejected in our minds the historicity of this spot as being the birthplace of the divine Christ, it served to remind us that in this neighborhood came into the world the Only Begotten of the Father whose mortal birth we will soon be celebrating.\nThoughts on the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder A. William Lund Assistant Church Historian\nOn December 23, 1943, we celebrate the 138th anniversary of the birth of Joseph Smith, a Prophet of our Lord. The history of this good man, especially during the years from 1820 to 1844, is one of the most interesting stories ever told. Space will not permit of details but only a few thoughts concerning him. However, in this short period of time and in the face of all kinds of persecution, Joseph Smith accomplished a great work which still is a \"marvelous work and a wonder.\"\nIn the fifteenth year of his life the different religious sects, in his home town, were holding revival meetings. Joseph, being of a religious nature, attended these meetings with a desire to know which sect he should join. As each of these denominations taught different doctrines and each claimed to be right, his mind was confused at their claims. Being a reader of the Bible he read the words of the Apostle James: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"\nThese words so impressed the young man that he went into a wood where, in the humility of his soul, he poured out his heart in prayer to God that He would show him which church to join. This humble prayer was answered by the most glorious vision shown to man.\nThis boy saw two Personages, the glory of whom defied all description, standing above him. One of these persons, pointing to the other, said: \"This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\" Joseph was told to join none of the churches for \"they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\"\nWhen this young man told of his vision, he was laughed at and made light of but he answered: \"I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it.\"\nThrough this vision the young man revealed anew to the world the truth that God is a personal being and that Jesus Christ is His Son and is a personal being, separate from the Father.\nA few years passed and Joseph Smith, desiring to know what his standing was before the Lord, sought the Lord in humble prayer. In answer to this prayer an angel, named Moroni, was sent to give further instruction to this young man and to tell him where a sacred record of the early inhabitants of America was hidden. Also the angel told him that \"when these things begin to be known, that is, when it is known that the Lord has shown you these things, the workers of iniquity will seek your overthrow; they will circulate falsehoods to destroy your reputation, and also will seek to take your life; but remember this if you are faithful, and shall hereafter continue to keep the commandments of the Lord, you shall be preserved to bring these things forth.\"\nThis statement of the angel was literally fulfilled. When Joseph Smith received the plates he had to use every plan he could think of to keep the plates from falling into the hands of the enemy. Through his faithfulness, even though he was hindered in every way, he published to the world this record known as the Book of Mormon.\nThe angel also told him \"that the knowledge which this record contains will go to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people under the whole heaven.\" Here again is a prediction made to Joseph Smith before the record was printed, yet it, too, has been fulfilled. The Book of Mormon has been published in eighteen different languages and by means of the radio the knowledge it contains has been broadcast throughout the world.\nThe angel further said, speaking of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, \"when they are interpreted, the Lord will give the holy priesthood to some, and they shall begin to proclaim this Gospel and baptize by water, and after that they shall have power to give the Holy Ghost by the laying on of their hands. Then will persecution rage more and more.\"\nThe Priesthood was bestowed upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. On May 15, 1829, these two men received the Aaronic Priesthood from John the Baptist, and a short time later received the Melchizedek Priesthood under the hands of Peter, James and John, apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. After this Priesthood was restored and men were given the authority to perform the ordinances necessary to obtain eternal life, greater and more severe persecution was heaped upon Joseph Smith and his followers.\nThe angel also said to Joseph Smith: \"Your name shall be known among the nations, for the work which the Lord will perform by your hands shall cause the righteous to rejoice and the wicked to rage: with the one it shall be had in honour, and with the other in reproach.\" This statement made to this young, unknown man has had its literal fulfillment. Throughout the whole world his name is held in loving reverence by all his followersin honor and respect by his friends, and in reproach by his enemies.\nAt the time when the vision of the Father and His Son was given to Joseph Smith, when the Book of Mormon was brought forth and when the Priesthood of God was restored, there was no church upon the face of the earth, with all its learning, that understood or taught the doctrines of Jesus Christ, our Savior. This young man, without fear, but as the humble servant of God, gave to the world the true ordinances and doctrines of the Lord. He, under direct commandment, organized the Church of Jesus Christ with the same offices that the Lord Himself set up in His Church to bring all to the unity of the faith.\nThe Prophet affirmed that faith in the Lord, repentance from sin, baptism by immersion for the remission of sin, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands were absolutely essential to our salvation and necessary to enter Christ's Church. Joseph Smith also pointed out that all ordinances of the Gospel of our Lord must be performed by one having authority from God.\nHe taught that we all were the children of God and that our spirits were the offspring of our Eternal Father and that we lived with Him before we came upon this earth and had our spirits clothed upon with mortality. He preached that as Jesus Christ arose from the dead that we all should arise from the dead, and that this resurrection would be the re-uniting of our spirit with our body, even in the same manner that the resurrection of our Savior was a re-uniting of His spirit with His body. Also, he taught that after the resurrection the body and spirit could never again be separated.\nHe explained that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was the power of God unto salvation to everyone of our Father's children; that all those who had died, or who would yet die, who had not the chance to hear the Gospel, would be given that chance, that the ordinances necessary for the salvation of the living would be given to those who were dead by living persons acting as proxy for the dead persons; that our dear Lord gave His life thus doing a vicarious work for us that we could not do for ourselves, and that our Lord opened the way for the Gospel to be preached to the dead as His spirit preached to the dead while His body lay in the tomb. In fact, Joseph Smith taught all the principles and ordinances taught by our Lord as necessary to everlasting life.\nWhile restoring to the earth the fulness of the Gospel, receiving and publishing revelations from God, and establishing the Relief Society and other helps for his followers, Joseph Smith also showed himself as a remarkable leader in the temporal affairs of his people. He helped choose sites for cities and helped in their building. In the building of the Kirtland and Nauvoo temples he helped dig the excavations and also took part at the pinery to cut timber for them. The welfare of his people was always near to his heart; this is shown by the following story related of him by Brother Andrew Workman, of Virgin City, Washington County, Utah:\n\"I was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky, July 15th, 1824. Joined the Church in Overton County, Tennessee, March, 1842. I saw the Prophet Joseph for the first time in May of the same year. He was with about a dozen others on the stand in a meeting. I knew him as soon as I saw him. Although I was young I knew him to be a man of God. A few days after this I was at Joseph's house; he was there, and several men were sitting on the fence. Joseph came out and spoke to us all. Pretty soon a man came up and said that a poor brother who lived out some distance from town had had his house burned down the night before. Nearly all of the men said they felt sorry for the man. Joseph put his hand in his pocket, took out five dollars and said, 'I feel sorry for this brother to the amount of five dollars; how much do you all feel sorry?'\"\nWhen Commerce, later named Nauvoo, was purchased, the place was very swampy and he personally supervised its draining. He advised the best plants, shrubbery, and (Continued on page 744)\nThe 114th Semi-annual Conference Elder Richard L. Evans Member of the First Council of Seventy\nA comparative estimate of a general conference would in many respects be meaningless, because conference is a combination of many elements, and because perhaps its greatest values are intangible. And when, each time a conference closes, one hears the frequent remark, \"It was the best conference yet,\" it isn't just a thoughtless superlative. To those who so speak, it may be the best conferenceat least the best one they can remember. A particularly good meal of which we have just received a satisfying fullness is likely to be more acutely appreciated than a good meal of which we have partaken some time ago. And many felt that way about this conference.\nBeyond the intangibles, however, there are some statistical bases of comparison. The attendance at this conference was, for example, somewhat smaller than attendance in the immediate past. This was to be expected. Many priesthood officers of the Church are in the armed forces of the country. Many others are pressingly engaged in defense industries and activities. Farmers are pressed for help more acutely than in past years. Transportation, both private and public, is circumscribed by more difficulties than many of us can remember its ever having been. All this combined to reduce attendancenotwithstanding which the main body of the Tabernacle was comfortably and impressively filled.\nThis was the fourth semi-annual conference of the Church at which attendance has been restricted since the United States entered the warrestricted in consideration of the overtaxed burdens of the people and restricted in cooperation with the general program of economy in travel and man power.\nThe sessions began on Friday afternoon, October 1st, with general sessions, six in all, continuing Saturday morning, afternoon, and evening, and Sunday morning and afternoon. All of the general sessions, except the Saturday evening session, were broadcast through the facilities of Radio Station KSL. The regular nationwide Sunday morning KSL-C. B. S. Broadcast from the Tabernacle occupied the first thirty minutes of the Sunday morning session. Two special meetings were held concurrently Friday eveningone for bishoprics in the Assembly Hall and one for Welfare chairmen in the Young Memorial Building.\nPresident Heber J. Grant was in attendance much of the time, and had intended to speak, but, on the late advice of his physician, did not do so. President David O. McKay conducted all of the general sessions, and also read President Grant's message, which was one of blessing and reminderreminder that we are the architects of our own lives, and that no power anywhere can prevent any Latter-day Saint from being saved, except himself. The closing paragraphs of President Grant's talk follow:\nAs it was during our meetings last April in our annual conference, so today we have thousands of our young men in the armed forces of the warring nations. Constantly I pray that the Lord will bless each and every one, and that he will help each of them to live in accordance with the principles of the gospel, so that he may have a claim to the blessings of the Lord to the full extent that accords with his wisdom. I pray that, so far as it accords with the providences of the Lord, each of them may be preserved from accident, sickness, and death, to return in due course to his loved ones. I pray God to help them to stand up under the terrible strain which they must meet. I appeal to the Lord to bring the war to an end at the earliest possible date. Consequently my heart goes out in the deepest sympathy for the comforting influence of the Lord to be given to the fathers and mothers of the sons who are in the war at the present time. May the comforting influence of the Spirit of the Lord be given to them in carrying their burdens, and to bring solace to their yearning hearts. I am praying with all my heart and soul for the end of this war as soon as the Lord can see fit to have it stop, and am earnestly praying for the influence of the Spirit of the Lord to be with all who have loved ones in the war. I pray that the spirit of peace and of increased faith may pervade all the homes of the Latter-day Saints, and with all the power and authority I have to bless, I invoke God's blessing upon the Church as a whole and upon the honest in heart everywhere.\nPresident J. Reuben Clark, Jr. reviewed some of the remarkable accomplishments of the Church Welfare program, gave an account of Church finances and their stewardship, spoke of the illimitable possibilities of this people if they would work in oneness of purpose; and differentiated between communism and the United Order. Some of the sentences from his talk follow:\nThus far in 1943 our tithes have increased over 1942 by more than fifty percent.\nThe United Order and communism are not synonymous.... Those who go about telling us otherwise either do not know or have failed to understand or are wilfully misrepresenting.\nThere has come into the Church an ever-increasing spirituality because of the giving which has been incident to the carrying on of the Welfare work.\nThe Lord told his disciples.... That they must be one, and that he expected his people to be one.\nI am sure we have demonstrated in this Welfare program, and in the more or less auxiliary home canning, in what has heretofore been more or less of an experiment, what we can do, we of the Church, if we set our minds and our hearts on carrying out the admonition of our prophet in becoming self-sustaining.\nWe believe that if we included the canning done by Church families in the missions, the total number of cans of fruits and vegetables which we shall have in these three ways brought into storage for the next year, will approximate, if not exceed, 50,000,000 cans. This represents over 1,000,000,000 points.\nPresident David O. McKay, in a stirring address of the Saturday morning session, spoke on \"The Home Front.\" Social evils, selfishly restricted families, divorce, and the early training of children were among the subjects on which counsel and statistical fact were given. Said he:\nTeach the young people that marriage is not merely a man-made institution, but that it is ordained of God....\nIt is the duty of everyone to strive to make it possible that no soldier now dreaming of a happy homecoming may return only to find a broken home or its ideals shattered by the sinful indulgences of a member of the family.\nLife is too short and love too great to sacrifice one hour through pettiness.\nThe foundation of a happy home is laid during pre-marital days.\nSeeking the pleasures of conjugality without willingness to assume the responsibilities of rearing a family is one of the onslaughts that now batter at the structure of the American home.\nThis was the first conference to present President George Albert Smith in his new capacity as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. President Smith's address cited the historical disasters that had come to generations and centuries of nations and peoples who have refused to repent, and the blessings and forgiveness that have come to those who have turned to the Lord. His sermon carried with it the spirit of these passages in the 23rd chapter of Matthew:\nO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\nOccasions have not been frequent in the Church when two new members of the Quorum of the Twelve have been presented at the same conference. This was one such occasion. Elder Spencer W. Kimball and Elder Ezra T. Benson were sustained by the upraised hands of the priesthood of Israel and responded to their calls with humility and in the spirit of dedication.\nFrom Brother Kimball came this word:... I know that this is the Church and kingdom of God. It has been a part of me. Whenever it has prospered I have gloried in it. When it was criticized, it has hurt me, for it seemed a part of my very being. Every fibre in my body bears witness that this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness.\nAnd from Brother Benson: It has been my glorious privilege to be blessed with wonderful opportunities in my life. But my happiest days have been those spent with the priesthood and the membership of this Church. *... More than anything else, besides my desire to maintain my testimony, I desire the love and confidence of the priesthood of this church, and I pray the Lord to give me strength that I may merit that love and confidence.\nThose who listened by radio, and those who sat in the presence of these two new members of the Quorum of the Twelve, felt and knew that there are many good and wise and able men throughout the Church, and that the Lord had called two such to a high trust.\nAll the general authorities of the Church were present and presented messages. The space allotted here will not permit the recital even of the theme-sentence of eachbut there was a oneness of feeling about the entire proceedings; the addresses were uniformly thoughtful and satisfying and the conference was free from any jarring note or discordant thought. Fortunately, the entire (Continued on page 744)\nLook at the Star Beatrice Rordame Parsons\nLucy felt it would never arrive. The crowds were thick and people jostled her. Excited children left harried parents and rushed to the Salvation Army Santa Claus for one last, quick instruction on how to find a particular chimney. The air was scented with pine and holly as men with great armloads pressed against her. Even the red, blue, and green lights had been fastened to the lampposts and they glowed with a gay, Christmasy brilliance. But Lucy frowned. The doctor had said it was neuritis that made her hip ache like that. He had told her to go home and to bed; but how could she? Just a few days before Christmas with so many things to do.\nThe bus was a long time coming. This year they'd all be together. The words had been humming through her heart all day. Even the pain was quiet when she thought of it. This Christmas must be perfect! Lucy wanted that more than she wanted anything in the world. Ever since she'd had that letter from Hal saying he was sure of his furlough, she had been planning. He was bringing his wife. The family had never met her, though Hal had sent her photograph and written ecstatically:... I was scared that she wouldn't have me. She's been reared by a very wealthy aunt, and I have so little to offer. But I turned on the charm, and she couldn't resist. You'll love her, Mother...\nLucy hoped so, but she wasn't so sure. She had scribbled a friendly little note welcoming Iris into the family and had received a very formal letter in return. Iris' life had been very different from the sort of harum-scarum growing up that Hal had had. Lucy wanted Iris to think well of the family. She had worked hard to make the house look nice. Iris was used to such elegance.\nAs she boarded the bus, Lucy thought about Ben's sister. She was coming to dinner, too. Ada was a grave old maid. She taught history at high school and Lucy had often pitied her the barrenness of her existence. Ada had missed so much.\nLucy dropped the token in the box and her lips were tender. How much fun Christmas had been when the children were small. But seeing the restless, almost dissatisfied faces about her, Lucy thought of the war. How hard it had become for anyone to have faith in the old, familiar words: Peace on earth, good will toward men! Why, even Link, who was only eleven wished he might have a real machine gun to shoot real bullets.\nLucy shivered as she got off the bus. Crossing the street she saw that the early winter sunset made an intricate pattern of shadows through the leafless trees. Then she forgot its beauty as she realized that Link had not cleaned the walks. When she opened the front door, she saw why he had neglected them. There was a cluster of dripping straps and ice skates on the floor. She must remember, she decided worriedly, to wipe up the snow before it left a stain on the polished floor.\n\"Is that you, Mother?\" The sound of a girlish voice floated down the stairs and Miriam appeared on the landing. She was a pretty girl of fifteen with blue eyes and a long V of brown curls reaching down to the middle of her shoulders. She had been painting her nails and was careful not to touch anything.\nLucy protested. \"That's entirely too dark a shade for a young girl.\"\nMiriam blew on her thumb, paying no attention. \"Did you get the material?\" she asked.\nLucy put her coat on a hanger. She put Miriam's, too, for Miriam had simply flung it on a hook. Then she pointed out a bundle.\n\"You open it,\" said Miriam. \"My nails might smudge.\"\nLucy undid the string. Her eyes were on Miriam's face. She did hope the silk would suit. She had had to go to four stores.\n\"Oh, dear,\" Miriam pouted, \"that isn't what I meant at all. Sally's is a lighter blue. We wanted them exactly alike.\"\nLucy folded the silk and fastened the string. As Miriam went upstairs, Lucy was conscious that her hip was aching worse than ever. She was so sorry Miriam didn't like the material for her new dress. She had tried to please her. She wondered why it was that everything Sally had seemed so much nicer to Miriam than the things she owned.\nWhen she went into the living room, her husband looked up. He was in his favorite chair, and the lamp was soft above his rumpled brown hair. Lucy dropped a little kiss in the middle of it, and he smiled pleasantly.\n\"I thought you'd never get home. I'm practically famished.\"\nLucy smoothed down her fair waves before the round mirror over the buffet and there was a little frown between her dark brows. \"Ben, I just couldn't find a thing for Ada. I've given her so many umbrellas, hankies and slips that I'm ashamed to give her any more.\"\nShe started to undo one of the packages she had brought into the room, but Ben put out his hand.\n\"What do you say we wait until some other time, dear? I've got to slip down to the office right after we eat.\"\nLucy limped a little as she went into the kitchen. All the pleasure and excitement of her shopping trip were slipping away. She sighed as she caught sight of the cabinet. Link had had a snack after school. The peanut butter jar was open, the bread unwrapped. She thought impatiently: \"Miriam might have cleared that mess away before she went to dress.\"\nShe tied a bright, organdy apron over her frock and cleared the sink. Then she started dinner. Lucy liked things neat. She spent a lot of time over her house and prided herself that she was a good housekeeper. The glasses shone as she carried them into the dining room.\nLeona came in while she was setting the table. Leona was almost nineteen, with her father's clear brown eyes and her mother's soft, fair curls. Right now dissatisfied lines etched the corners of her mobile mouth.\n\"Oh, I wish Christmas was a million miles away,\" she said as she dropped into a chair. \"Nobody knows what I go through at Taylor's.\"\nLeona worked in the office of one of the biggest department stores in the city, and Lucy knew how busy she was. Looking at her as she placed the silver, Lucy saw the same thing in her daughter's face that had been in those on the street cara restlessness that was hard to explain. She knew that Leona and Dave had had another quarrel. Leona wanted to be married before Dave went away. She had her wages at the store, and she could go on living at home. Dave had other ideas. He didn't want to start that way. He said he loved Leona too much to make her suffer.\nLucy sighed. Back in the kitchen she thought about the Christmases of long ago. How secure they had been. How wonderful! She couldn't keep her mind from going back.... She recalled a cold, wintry dawn creeping out of the darkness of the night, excited whispers, the patter of bare feet coming into the bedroom. What expectancy had been in the childish faces. What faith had been in their eyes. Oh, for Christmas as it had been when her children were small!\nNow they were changed. Leona was young and lovely yet there were bitter lines about her eyes and a set smile on her lips. She had lost her little-girl laughter, and appeared hard and brittle. Miriam was fast growing into a petulant, thoughtless young woman, thinking of nothing but clothes and fun. Boys like Link, she thought, her hands cold as she mixed the dough for biscuits, were becoming calloused and hard. Even Ben seemed to think only of his stomach. Perhaps rationing was to blame for that. He had followed her into the kitchen and was poking into the refrigerator.\n\"Um,\" he said, licking his finger.\nLucy rescued the vanilla pudding and frowned reprovingly. \"Honestly, Ben, you don't let me get in the door before you start yelling for something to eat.\"\nBen cupped her chin in his palms and studied her flushed features. \"Have a good time downtown?\"\nShe pulled her face indignantly away. \"I just wish you'd do the shopping, Ben Henderson. You seem to think Christmas is fun.\"\n\"Well, isn't it?\" challenged Ben with a teasing grin.\nFeeling the way she did, Lucy wasn't sure. \"Fun for children,\" she admitted reluctantly. She had just finished her housecleaning. Remembering all the woodwork she had scrubbed, all the curtains she had hung, her wrongs rose within her. \"I have to see to everything,\" she complained. \"Link wanted something for the school tree. I had to go to three stores. Miriam is disappointed in her new dress.\"\nBen sat on the stepladder stool and pushed his feet through the rungs. There was a look in his eyes. \"I suppose it isn't like Sally's,\" he said.\nLucy had to smile. But the worried light remained in the depths of her eyes. \"I'm sure I don't know how I'm going to find the time to make it. Tomorrow, I'm going to get out the decorations.\"\n\"Oh, let 'em go,\" said Ben carelessly, as he pushed open the door and disappeared into the living room. \"Or let Link put them up.\"\nLucy poured milk into a pitcher with angry hands. That seemed to be her family's cry, nowadays. Let someone else do it. If you wanted things done right, you must do them yourself. Couldn't Ben understand that it was important how the house looked when Iris came?\nShe found a cloth and went into the hall to wipe up the snow. Bending made her hip ache again, and she looked tired as she carried the plates into the dining room.\nLink had come in and was lying in the middle of the floor where she had to step around him, looking at the funnies in the newspaper. He had shed his cap by tossing it over a candlestick on the buffet. The sleeves of his jacket were hooked across the back of a dining room chair.\n\"Link,\" said Lucy sharply, \"I thought I asked you to clean the walks.\"\nLink looked lazily out of the darkening windows. A few thistlelight snowflakes were touching the glass. \"No sense cleaning walks when it's going to snow,\" he said, and turned back to his paper.\nLucy bit her lip as she carried his jacket and cap to the hall closet. That seemed to be Link's philosophy of life. No sense watering the lawn when it was going to rain. No sense raking leaves when it was going to blow. Suddenly, in Lucy's mind, Link seemed very selfish and very lazy.\nHe was chuckling at Flip Corkin when Lucy came back into the room. \"Whee!\" he chortled, pointing to a falling, flaming plane. \"That's just what those enemy bombers and planes deserve.\"\nNot even Christmas, thought Lucy wearily, could make her son's thoughts of peace, good-will toward men.\nIn the middle of dessert Link stopped eating long enough to say: \"Oh, Maw, did you get the tree?\"\nLucy appealed to Ben. \"You were to attend to that.\"\nBen flushed. \"I forgot,\" he confessed, then added placatingly: \"I'll get it tomorrow. There's still plenty of time.\"\nPlenty of time, agreed Lucy silently, if they were to be content with a spindling little thing that they'd be ashamed of. Pictures of the sort of trees Iris had always been used to rose before her eyes and made her voice sharp. \"Please see to it first thing in the morning.\"\nLink seemed to sense her exasperation, and he looked up and grinned. \"Gee, Maw! Any ole tree's all right if it's got a star at the top.\"\n\"I want a nice one,\" said Miriam insistently. \"You should see the one Sally's got. It must be nine feet tall.\"\nLucy winced, and Ben winked at her.\nLeona yawned as she left the table. \"What difference does it make?\" she asked rather bitterly. \"We're all adults, or aren't we?\"\nAs Lucy carried the dishes into the kitchen, Leona's words rang in her ears. Leona had meant: \"What difference does anything make, any more?\" Lucy's heart ached for her daughter. She wanted to see her happy and gay again.\nBen came into the kitchen as she was hanging up her dishtowel. He had his overcoat over his arm and he stopped in surprised chagrin. \"I thought Miriam was helping you.\"\nLucy hid her face as she put away the cups. \"She and Sally went to the movies,\" she said.\nBen frowned, started to speak, then slipped his arms into his coat sleeves. He didn't look at her. \"I'd have helped if I'd known,\" he told her.\nLucy kissed the end of his nose as she buttoned his coat. When she walked with him to the door, her lips were smiling. \"It doesn't matter, Ben,\" she said sincerely. \"I like to do it.\"\nShe really did. Perhaps that was why the girls were such bad housekeepers. Miriam and Leona had a way of leaving odds and ends undone. Lucy liked to have a neat kitchen. Her eyes twinkled. \"I can't imagine what sort of Christmas we'd have if I let the girls attend to it.\"\nNow she was really laughing and she added teasingly: \"And I shudder to think of the gift you'd choose for Ada.\"\nShe didn't know there was anything prophetic in her words. Even when she awoke in the night with the pain in her hip feeling like hot wires inside, she thought she would be all right in the morning. But when she tried to get up, she had to fall back against the pillow with a moan.\nBen, white-lipped and worried, insisted on knowing what the doctor had said. \"Just rest and the heating pad,\" confessed Lucy, \"with vitamin B thrown in.\"\nShe held her breath while the pain came. And went, and then she wailed: \"Oh, Ben, I can't stay in bed. There're a million things to do.\"\nBen's voice was gruff. \"You've done too much already. Just relax, and I'll send up a tray.\"\nShe might not have been quite so acquiescent if her pain hadn't been so severe.\nLink came bearing the tray proudly, scraped toast, thickly sliced orange, lukewarm cocoa. She smiled wanly. \"I hope this won't spoil your Christmas,\" she said.\n\"It won't,\" said Link cheerfully.\nLong after he had gone, Lucy stared at the door. She had been right. Link was hard and callous. Christmas meant very little to him.\nLeona put her head in the doorway as she rushed off to catch her bus. \"I'll get the turkey and you can tell me how to make the dressing.\"\nShe fumbled in her purse for her lipstick and didn't look at her mother as she rouged her lips with the aid of her compact mirror. \"Who knows? Dave may fall for my cooking. If I give him a bang-up meal, he won't think I'm such a debit.\"\nLucy's mouth dropped in amazement. Certainly neither Dave nor any other man would ever fall for Leona's cooking. How many times had she tried to impress her daughter with the fact that keeping house was an art? Now that it was too late, Leona was planning on bowling Dave over with an elaborate Christmas dinner. Lucy's head ached just contemplating it.\nMiriam dropped into her mother's bedroom on her way to school. She had the unwanted silk in her hands and she sat on the bed. \"I just ran over and showed it to Sally. She says it won't be so terrible if I make it by her pattern. I'm going to take it to school and get Miss Robbins to help me cut it out.\"\nLucy had a sort of lost feeling in the pit of her stomach. Miriam was taking sewing at school, but her seams were always so crooked!\nAt lunch time, Ben hurried home from the office to fix the furnace and get her lunch. But he burned the leftover soup and Lucy had to compromise on bread and milk. That night at dinner there was a rumpled napkin on her tray and one of her best cups from the china cabinet in the dining room. It was Miriam who let it slip that they had run out of kitchen china. But later, Link came to report that Dave had done K. P. Duty. He \"had swung a mean dishtowel,\" and according to Link, everything was \"under control.\"\n\"Pop bought the tree and let me help pick out Ada's present,\" said Link as he said goodnight.\nLucy felt relieved when the house settled down to sleep. Things weren't really going as bad as she had imagined they would. Perhaps she'd be up tomorrow.\nBut Hal arrived in the middle of the argument she was having with Ben about it, and vetoed her suggestion. \"I'm the doctor,\" he said, kissing her fondly, and he added as he drew Iris into the room: \"And this is the doctor's wife.\"\nLucy put out her arms. She had meant to kiss her new daughter-in-law, but the hand that touched her fingers was very cool. There was a wary formality in the girl's tone. \"I'm so sorry you're ill, Mrs. Henderson,\" said Iris politely, and her eyes went around the room.\nLucy was painfully conscious of the soiled towel in the middle of her dressing table, of the empty tray on the window seat. She felt sure that the downstairs part of the house was in similar disarray. Iris' first impression of the Henderson menage hadn't been exactly what Lucy had desired; but she tried to comfort herself with a happy thought. \"I'll be up in the morning. Then I'll tidy things up and use the nicest silver. Perhaps she'll think better of us.\"\nBut in the morning her pain was worse. The family declared they could manage. \"Iris can wash the dishes,\" said Hal magnanimously, and Lucy saw the look that came into the girl's pretty face. Iris wasn't used to doing dishes.\n\"Miriam can do them when she gets home from school,\" said Lucy, but Miriam protested. \"I've got to stay and finish my dress. Iris can do them.\" She looked at her brilliant nails. \"Besides, I don't want to chip my polish.\"\nLucy glanced at the exquisite brilliance of Iris' shining nails. She wanted to shake her daughter; but later she heard Iris and Hal in the kitchen. There was a clatter of dishes and the sound of voices. Once when the door swung open, she heard Iris laugh. She didn't sound too terribly unhappy. But, of course, she had Hal, and that, decided Lucy with mother-like devotion, was enough to make any girl laugh like that!\nWhen the family came home the evening passed with a great deal of commotion. The girls kept running in to ask where things were. Lucy's mind was a treadmill of doubt. When Link shoved his rumpled head in at the door, she wanted to ask questions herself. But he just grinned widely, and said: \"Gee, Maw, we trimmed the tree. It's a beaut!\"\nLucy was pleased. So Ben had found a nice one. But trimming it always made such a mess. When Ben came up, she asked what he had done with the boxes.\n\"I just shoved 'em behind the divan,\" he replied and seemed to consider himself so clever that Lucy hadn't the heart to scold.\nJust as she was dropping off to sleep she remembered that Ben hadn't told her what he had bought for Ada. She asked him what it was, leaning up on her elbow to look across at the other bed. He mumbled sleepily and turned over. It didn't matter. A false complacency lulled her to rest.\nChristmas morning dawned as all Christmas mornings should dawn, clear, cold and bright, with a tiny pattern of frost fingers against the windows where the furnace heat hadn't reached. The entire family trooped into Lucy's bedroom and watched her undo her packages. She felt a very gay invalid in a blue, quilted robe, satin mules, and a dash of Link's rather highly scented perfume.\nLater, Ben and Hal made a \"chair\" with their hands and carried her downstairs into the living room while the rest of them opened their presents. There was so much laughter and excitement that for a little while she didn't notice her surroundings. When she did, she suppressed a little gasp. Link had said the tree was a \"beaut\"; but Lucy saw that even the bright, new star on the topmost branch couldn't hide its thin, straggling formation. It was the worst they'd ever had!\nAs Ada untied a bit of red ribbon, Lucy held her breath for she realized what the present was that Ben had picked out. There was a shout of merriment as Ada held up a doll, a long-legged French affair with unreal blonde hair and taffeta ruffles. Link explained: \"It's to put in the middle of your bed.\"\nAda thanked Ben gravely, but her cheeks were flushed. Lucy couldn't help thinking it was a ridiculous gift for an old maid.\nWhen dinner was ready, Leona declared that everyone must help carry in the food. Dave triumphantly bore the turkey in on the platter and Lucy thanked her lucky stars for an automatic gas oven. Ben slid her to the table in a big chair so that she would not have to walk. When grace had been said, the plates were quickly filled.\nLucy thought the turkey was tough, the gravy lumpy, and that the dressing had too much onion in it. But as she watched them eat, she saw that they didn't seem to notice. Dave couldn't get over the fact that Leona had prepared this magic feast with her own small hands, and Lucy didn't remind him of the numerous trips Leona had made to her couch to inquire how to cook the meal.\nWhen Leona cleared away the plates, Dave helped her, and when they came from the kitchen with the dessert, Leona's eyes were shining. When she leaned over to fill her mother's glass, she whispered in her ear: \"It turned the trick, darling. He's willing to take a chance. Says he doesn't want to lose such a good cook.\"\nLucy pressed her daughter's fingers tightly. There were tears in her eyes as she saw Leona's face. The bitterness had fled, only laughter lurked in her smile.\n\"I speak to wash the dishes,\" said Iris loudly when they had finished.\nLucy was startled and her eyes sought her daughter-in-law's hands. The brilliant nail polish was chipped and worn, but Iris didn't seem to care. While the entire party trooped into the kitchen to help, Lucy lay back on the pillows of her divan and looked about her house.\nThe boxes which Ben had shoved behind the divan were beginning to overflow. Evidently, everyone with an unwanted box had thought of the same thing. The wreaths at the windows hung rather lopsidedly on their red ribbon bows. Tin-foil icicles dripped onto the floor under the tree. The evergreens over the fireplace were threatening to tumble down.\nLucy couldn't understand it. Couldn't anyone else see that the living room carpet was littered with bits of string and hundreds of pine needles from the dried-up tree? Couldn't any of them see that nothing was just exactly right?\nLink came into the room, his face smeared with chocolate, and began to tinker with the lights. \"I gotta put in a new globe,\" he told his mother as he hurried away.\nAda came through the living room with a pile of plates for the china cabinet. As she passed her French doll, she put out her hand and touched the pale-green taffeta ruffles. Lucy saw her eyes. They were no longer faded and dull. The doll had brought back her youth.\nThe room was drowsily quiet when Iris came in. Lucy wasn't sure she was beside her until she lifted her lashes and saw her smiling. There was a sort of inner glow in the girl's face, and when Lucy patted the couch, Iris sat down.\n\"This is the nicest Christmas I've ever known,\" she said wistfully, and Lucy saw that the diamond ring she wore was dull with grease and soap.\nSuddenly she touched Lucy's hand. \"Mrs. Henderson,\" she began, and changed it to: \"Mother, Hal and I want you to be the first to know. We're having a baby in July.\"\nFor a moment Lucy didn't move. She wanted to be sure she heard the simple words. Then her fingers tightened about the girl's hand and she drew her close for a happy kiss. \"I'll have to tell Ben,\" she whispered wonderingly.\nBut Ben and Hal were coming into the room, their arms about each other's shoulders. Iris' eyes twinkled mischievously. \"I don't think you'll have to,\" she said, and went into Ben's opened arms.\nLink came back with the globe he had been hunting. It was a moment before he got it screwed in. The others came out of the kitchen and waited breathlessly. Suddenly the tree was a blaze of light. The star at the top gleamed benevolently. Link's voice was filled with glee. \"I told you, Maw. A tree's swell when it's got a star at the top!\"\nEverybody laughed gently, and admired the display. Leona's hand was linked with Dave's brown one, and there was joy in her eyes. Hal had his arm about his wife's slim waist and there was no fear for the future in either of their faces. Miriam wore her crooked-seamed dress with an arrogant air. When she moved, the skirt flared out and she watched it happily. \"It's a lot prettier than Sally's,\" she admitted with a smile.\nBen stood thoughtfully stroking his chin. \"I hope it's a boy,\" he said out of his dreams, and no one laughed.\nDeep in her soul Lucy knew peace. \"Boy, or girl,\" she said teasingly, \"it will be thrilling to be a grandmother.\"\nShe saw very clearly, now, that Link had been right. Christmas is always wonderful if you look at the star! Thoughts on the Prophet Joseph Smith (Continued from page 732) trees be planted and that all houses should be solidly built. Of the charter, which was to govern this city, he wrote: \"The City Charter of Nauvoo is of my own plan and device. I concocted it for the salvation of the Church, and on principles so broad, that every honest man might dwell secure under its protective influence without distinction of sect or party.\" He believed in home manufacture and under his encouragement many manufactories were established, a few are here mentioned: namely, a cabinet manufactory, a rope manufactory, a bakery, a _ bookstore, and bindery, a comb manufactory, a boot and shoe shop, a carpenter and joiner's shop, a library, a blacksmith shop, a brick kiln, a dentist parlor, a spinning wheel manufactory, a millinery and dressmaking shop, and a watch and clockmaker's shop. In an educational way he was instrumental in having established,. The School of the Prophets, The University of Nauvoo, The Nauvoo Seminary, an Institute, common schools and the Nauvoo Manufacturing and Agricultural Society. This man was truly a Prophet of the Living God. The 114th Semi-annual Conference (Continued from page 735) published proceedings will be made widely available to the members of the Church. The presence of the women of the Church was sincerely missed. That which we do without their full participation is always lacking in completeness. If the messages of the 114th Semiannual conference were heeded by the people of the world, or any substantial part of them, there would quickly be restored those conditions of peace and freedom which would enable us to return to some cherished things, and to realize many blessings yet greater than any we have known Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon DECEMBER! 'The month commemorating the birth of the Prince of Peace, finds the sad paradox of a world still at war! The statement of George Lansbury, Britain's pre-war pacifist, is worth pondering that whenever the will to peace becomes mightier than the will to war, we shall have peace. This will is a qualitative, not quantitative, matter. Six years ago far more people desired peace than war; but the advocates of violence prevailed. Women want peace. 'They now have more understanding of world conditions than ever before, and more influence. Their will to peace must be so intense that no effort will be too costly, no price, within the realm of honor, too great to pay for it.

Page 745 EDITORIAL VOL. 30 DECEMBER 1943 NO. 12 The Blessed Refrain THERE seems to be a spirit of love in the very air one breathes at Christmas timea feeling of friendliness, a desire to help others, and a reaching out to those less fortunate. This spirit of true love pervades the air of the Christmas scene much as did the voices of the multitude of heavenly hosts nearly 2000 years ago who, praising God, said: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" To many of the inhabitants of the earth, this year, this message may sound like hollow mockery. Even in this country there will be few families whose circle will not be smaller, lacking the dear presence of some members who may be in grave danger in far-off lands under strange skies, or who may have gone ahead to that eternal land toward which we are all traveling. But to all saints who bear a love of Christ in their hearts and the knowledge that He is the Redeemer of the world, the first fruits of the resurrection, this heavenly enunciation should have added significance. Now especially should one render \"Glory to God in the highest,\" and gratefully echo the refrain, \"and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" One must give \"glory to God\" as much as one in his humble way may\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.\" As a result of this greatest Page 746 gift, as a result of the great sacrifice, there may come to all the inhabitants of the earth that peace which the heavenly hosts proclaimed following the angel's announcement of Christ's birth; the peace of the soul which comes from a knowledge of God's eternal plan and a consciousness that one is living in accordance with His plan; the peace which pervades the soul within and is in nowise dependent upon conditions without; the peace to be found in bringing one's own desires and hopes into harmony with the will of the Father and acknowledging \"the Lord knows best\"; the peace that comes from a ready acceptance of conditions as they affect one from day to day and a willing submission to them; the peace that comes from showing forth love toward one's fellow man even to the extent shown by so many loved ones in this day who stand ready to lay down their lives for their friends; the peace to be found at all times and in all dispensations in the Gospel of Jesus Christ'\"The peace of God which passeth all understanding.\" With this peace in one's heart, of necessity one has good will toward men. Then let not the anxieties, the sorrows of this day obliterate the joy to be found in a true observance of this Christmas and an appreciation of the blessed refrain: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\"M. C. S. - Women and the Church Canning Prog DURING the remarks made by President Clark at the opening session of the 114th semi-annual general conference, he estimated that fifty million cans of food had been preserved by members of the Church in 1943 for family and welfare use. He said:, For this tremendous achievement, the greatest that has come from a_ unified Church effort in a generation, the most credit and gratitude is due to the sisters of the Church who have done all the home canning as well as the bulk of the canning for the Welfare Program and the ward groups. We ask these sisters to receive the heartfelt thanks and congratulations of the whole body of the Church. As the remarks of President Clark were heard by the women members of the Church who were privileged to listen to the conference broadcast, they must have recalled long hours spent in hard work at a welfare cannery or over a hot stove on a summer's day when they had heeded the advice of Church leaders and preserved food for the coming winter. A feeling of satisfaction must also have come to these listeners as they fam visualized the rows of fruit and vegetables preserved for their families' use. Many of the groups who banded together to go to canneries consisted of members of ward and branch Relief Societies and many pressure cookers owned by Relief Societies were utilized by different ward groups. The General Board extends appreciation for the faithfulness and hard work performed by Relief Society members and the women of the Church in general who did so much to make this stupendous canning program a reality. A mother could ask for no greater blessing than to know that her children will not hunger during the coming winter, and to those women who not only provided for their own needs but for others as well, additional blessings will be visited upon them. An editorial in the Deseret News, October 4, 1943 \"Women of the Church, We Pay a Tribute\" honored the women for the part they are playing today both in the Church and nation. M.C.S.

Moyle, Deseret News Garden Editor CHRISTMAS will be made more C joyous and happy for countless sweethearts, wives, and mothers by the gift of some lovely, living plant, blooming in cultivated perfection. Few gifts carry so eloquent a message of love and courage, or say so well that old, old greeting of \"Merry, Merry Christmas,\" of \"Peace on Earth.\" The Christmas plant has now become one of the most popular and treasured of gifts; never are flowers more appreciated than during this loved season when all our thoughts turn to home and loved ones. \"A thing of beauty is a joy forever\" sings the poet, but alas! All too often our pleasure upon receiving such a plant is marred by the sad disappointment of seeing our lovely plant begin to droop and fade, often within a few hours after it is received. Why is it so difficult to keep these beautiful specimens of the professional florist's skill happy and contented in the changed environment of the modern living room? Why must the lovely, flaming poinsettia droop its great handsome leaves and vivid flower in such a discouraging manner? What makes the exquisite cyclamen, with its silken blooms poised like butterflies ready for flight, suddenly wither and become but a ruined shadow of its former glory; and why does that glamorous plant, the azalea, refuse to continue its thrilling show of fluted-petaled flowers and even discard its beautiful glossy foliage? 'These are the Page 748 questions that have puzzled countless recipients of the Christmas gift plant. We seldom stop to consider that the flowering plant has been living in the cool, moist air of the modern greenhouse, and that the change from this humid atmosphere to the hot, dry heat of the modern living room is a severe shock. Here are a few rules for the care of different gift plants. While no two are exactly alike in their requirements, one safe rule can be applied to all: namelydo not place your plant near a hot radiator nor in a too hot or heavily curtained room. Few greenhouse plants can endure the temperatures that we human be- - ings find so comfortable. Drafts, too, are extremely detrimental, and many a well-meaning flower lover will stand a beautiful flowering plant in a draft-swept hallway, thinking that it is just the right place for the plant's well-being, when really it supplies the most harmful conditions. This is especially true of the poinsettia, perhaps the most popular of all Christmas plants. Place your poinsettia in some warm, sunny, draft-free window, after first standing it in a pan of water until moisture shows on the surface of the soil. It should have a warm place which does not go below 70 degrees even at night. A lack of sun, chilling, and too much or too little water are the reasons why the flowers so often droop and fade. Water the plant thoroughly, using luke-warm water, CARE OF THE CHRISTMAS GIFT PLANT then wait until it begins to dry out slightly on the surface before again _ applying a generous drink. When the poinsettia begins to droop, after its flowers are all over, its resting time has come. Give it less and less water and remove it to some cool spot, the basement is ideal, where it can be given just enough occasional watering to keep the roots alive. When spring comes, cut your plant back to four inches and repot, using fresh garden loam, sand, and leaf mold or mountain soil of equal parts. Sink the pot outside in some spot where it can receive regular watering and soon it will begin to grow again. Be sure to bring the plant indoors before cold weather, and it will bloom again in time for the holiday season. HE azalea is becoming better known each year, and now rivals the poinsettia in popularity. This exquisite plant can now be purchased in sizes all the way from a small plant in a five-inch pot to the great specimen tree producing hundreds of lovely blooms. Should you be the fortunate recipient of one of these gorgeous flowering plants, do find a really cool spot for it. A sun parlor with indirect heat is ideal, but lacking this, place it in a cool window facing east or north. The azalea demands copious watering, twice each day not being too much. Some successful house-plant growers even keep the pot in a pail of water for a while each day. The roots of this plant are formed in a hard mat, and often the home gardener fails to give enough moisture to penetrate this hard mass. The foliage and stems of the plant should also 749 be sprayed or sprinkled often. Continue to give constant and plenty of moisture after the flowering period is over and remove the faded buds to prevent the seeds from maturing. If your plant begins to fade or look sick, give it a dose of the acid content which it needsone-half teaspoonful of aluminum sulphate in a quart of water, and apply gradually. When good weather arrives, the azalea should be put outside, sinking the pot in a hole and filling up with peat moss which is sold by nurserymen and florists. Water the plant with one-half teaspoonful of any good commercial fertilizer in a quart of water every two or three weeks, and when fall comes, remove the plant to the house, and it will again put out its lovely crop of bloom. Some local house-plant fans keep azalea plants flowering year after year with such treatment.\nThe cyclamen is another favorite plant. This grows from a central corm or bulb, much like a gladiolus, and it, too, needs a great deal of moisture, but beware of allowing water to reach the central bulb from which the delicate fleshy stems grow. The best method of watering the cyclamen is to stand the pot in a shallow bucket of warm water for an hour, then drain the water off before placing the plant back on the saucer on which it stands. Never, never, allow water to stand in the saucer under the plant, and if the leaves or stems wither, jerk them sharply away from the bulb before they begin to rot, for this may spread to the bulb itself. Do not expect to keep the cyclamen happy in your living room, but place it in some really cool, light window, which faces east so as to avoid full sun. If you can keep the cyclamen cool enough, it will go on opening its abundant supply of buds for weeks, and may even develop new ones.\nWe are all familiar with the cheery little Jerusalem cherry plant with its gay Christmas colors of red and green, but sad to tell, this dainty plant usually presents problems to keep it from dropping all its leaves soon after it comes into our overheated homes, for this plant considers 50 degrees a comfortable temperature in which to display its bright berries. If you receive this plant for Christmas, place it at once in your coldest north window, and spray and sprinkle the leaves several times each day to supply the moisture which it craves. The pepper plant with its oblong berries that are found in all stages of growth and coloring, endures a warm room much better than does the Jerusalem cherry, but it, too, needs the same constant care of watering and spraying. A daily bath and plenty of moisture it must have in order to be happy.\nOne other plant is grown extensively in local nurseries for Christmas time, the improved begonia semperflorens. Grandmother grew this plant in her kitchen window, but how the modern plant wizards have glamoured it and made it sparkle! The plants we enjoy today are a dazzling mound of vivid color with the flowers almost obliterating the foliage. If you can find just the right conditions for this plant, it will go on blossoming for you all winter, and you can take cuttings from it for planting out in your garden in the spring where they will continue their amazing flowering week after week. Place the plant, during the summer, in your coolest window which has sun, but guard against allowing the hot midday sun to strike it through the glass. This plant, too, needs plenty of moisture, but should not be kept sopping wet, just constantly moist.\nTo keep these flowering plants in bloom is no easy task, as you can see, but it is well worth taking the time to give each plant somewhat the conditions it needs, for nothing gives a home such a gay and happy note as do a few blossoming flowers, especially when ice and snow are in command on the other side of the window pane.\nONE STAR Della Adams Leitner\nThe heavens were filled with myriad stars, But one star led the way Unerringly through unknown lands To where the Christ Child lay.\nAnd in this day of flickering lights One steadfast beam from far Leads Christward every soul who seeks, God's love, His guiding star.\nChristmas on Tubuai in 1851 Nettie Hunt Rencher\nMy grandmother, Louisa Barnes Pratt, was the first woman to be called to fill a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In conference in Salt Lake City on the 6th of April, 1850, she received her call. When President Brigham Young set her apart for this work, he made her many wonderful promises which were literally fulfilled. Her mission was to the women and children of the South Sea Islands. She and her family of four daughters left Salt Lake City on the 7th of May, 1850, in company with ten missionaries, some of whom took their families. Louisa's husband, Addison Pratt, had preceded her eight months before. She made the long journey of one thousand miles by land, and five thousand miles by water in safety, as she had been promised. Five and a half months being required to make the journey. Her eldest daughter, a young lady nearly nineteen years of age, learned the language very easily, and acted as interpreter for her mother until she had mastered the language. Being born and reared in Massachusetts, Louisa had a splendid education for that day and time. She had taught school in the States, in Canada, Nauvoo, Winter Quarters, and Salt Lake City, and was now to continue her teaching in the Islands. She did a great work among the women and children of Tubuai, where she spent most of her time. She kept a journal a good deal of her life, and all the time while on her mission, the first entries being made more than one hundred years ago. It is from this journal that the story of \"Christmas on Tubuai in 1851\" is taken, given in her own words:\nWhen Christmas was drawing near, I called the Native Sisters around me and told them of the nearing event. We had taught them of the Savior's life and mission. I told them we would have a big celebration, and of course a great feast, as no affair was complete without a feast. They were all very much pleased. First I told them we must clean the large room used for church services, or angels would not minister unto us, for they take no delight in filth. So we took sand and scoured the benches and floor, to the delight of the native women who had not witnessed anything of the kind before. Now began our decorating. In the center of the room was a large pillar supporting the roof. On either side I placed an ito tree, of the most livid green, extending almost to the roof; to these I attached tea leaves, of which the females make wreaths because of their bright color, and pleasant odor. Added to these the bright fresh flowers of the bouran tree scattered about among the branches forming a pleasing contrast of lively green and yellow. Overhead and around the entire room, I hung boughs, flowers and branches of the lime tree with the fruit on. I had with me a picture of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum; these I hung on the wall. The native Saints regard them with great reverence. Then we invited our Church members and intimate friends. The natives gathered from far and near; thronged around the house, looking in at the windows, admiring the decorations. I felt annoyed and asked the chief to send them away. He plead for them, as a father would for children, saying they had never seen anything like it before. Would I not indulge them this once, next time they should be sent (Continued on page 760)\nCHRISTMAS PRAYER Claire S.

Thou wert so very far away, Until man askedthen was new sight Given, to hail a latter day!

Wells, published in the December 1890, and 1891 issues of the Woman's Exponent.\nDecember 15, 1891The people who dwell in these mountain vales have much to be grateful for even though they have some things not so agreeable. The children, for instance, their playhouses overflow on Christmas day; Santa has been very lavish in his regular supplies for the last few years, and our children of the present know very little of what the generation now grown up experienced in the early years in these valleys. Some of the many little stockings that were hung up around the primitive fireplaces were very scantily filled and others perhaps not at all. The mothers in those days didn't go out looking for Santa Claus, but many an earnest and heartfelt prayer was offered with tearful eyes and sorrowing heart, that the little ones might be happy and contented on Christmas day with what little it was possible to bestow.\nDecember 15, 1890We should be joyful at Christmas time for the sake of the children, if not for our own sake, and even if burdens oppress us or griefs have overtaken us, lay them aside for the time being and contribute in some measure to the enjoyment of others.... Children's impressions are deep-seated and strong and often follow them through life, and perhaps there is not a day that fastens itself more closely upon the heart and remembrance, and to which the child when grown to manhood turns with greater affection, than Christmas day at the old home, whether he goes out into the world alone, or travels the raging main, on sea or land wherever he may be, when the blessed Christmas time comes he invariably recalls the incidents of home life.\nTomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd\nCHAPTER IX\nSynopsis: Janet still fearful of San Juan, returns to El Toro with her twins to find that the country has risen to strike at her again, this time in the guise of a friend, now blind and helpless. It is almost more than she can face; but seeing the pain and disappointment in her husband's eyes, she determines to conquer her fears and accept the inevitable for his sake. In being \"eyes and ears\" for Dr. Groneman, Janet comes to an understanding of the strength and grandeur of San Juan, and above all, of the beauty around her. When it comes time for the famous doctor to return to his home in New York, she decides that his last day in the country shall be one to be remembered through all his dark and lonely days to come. This high resolve is all but shattered when the doctor announces that he wants to spend the day at the river. At once, and with renewed force, Janet's fears return, for the river above all else holds the most dread for her. But she courageously accepts the challengefor she feels that it is oneand says they will go to the river.\n\"Here's where we chute the chutes down the dugway,\" Janet warned. They rounded a curve, hung suspended above the river for a terrifying moment, and then shot downward with a speed that took Groneman's breath. He held onto his hat, whistled with satisfaction and measured their descent in seconds as they careened down the narrow dugway toward the bottom of the gorge.\nGroneman chuckled. \"You drive as though you want to get there before you change your mind.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Janet apologized. \"We'll approach the monster with caution!\" She jammed on the brakes and skidded to a snail's pace.\nGroneman leaning back leisurely gave a short, teasing laugh. \"Monster?\" he questioned. \"Prehistoric or current?\"\n\"Please!\" Janet's voice was tense. \"I try not to fear this country. Most of the time I can divert my unreasoning attitude\" She laughed shakily. \"Silly, isn't it? And the funny part is that the river isn't at all concerned about my fear. It is concerned only with its relentless destinationjust as I am with mine. Sometime our paths will cross. One of us will have to yield the right of way, and from the looks of that gorge down there, it won't be the river!\"\nJanet proceeded down the dugway at a pace that was very safe and sane, but Groneman knew she was trembling. Potsworth had told him that much of Janet's illness was the result of her instinctive fears. But he had discredited the extent of that, or he would not have insisted upon this trip to the river. He'd hoped vaguely that in some way he could help her. Now he knew that only the river itself could do that. And the country itself. Janet would never be happy in San Juan unless it took her to its heart by its own strength and beauty, its spiritual grandeur.\n\"Shall we walk to the edge?\" Janet asked, seemingly controlled.\n\"If you'll promise not to look down and get dizzy,\" he agreed lightly, glad to be rid of his unprofitable speculations.\nThey left the car with its engine pointing down hill, stalled against a boulder, and walked to the edge of the gorge just above the bridge that spanned it.\n\"Um-m-m, I can smell the water!\" Groneman sniffed appreciatively. \"Wonderful smell, isn't it?\"\n\"I like wood smoke,\" Janet evaded. \"I can smell fire.\"\nFrom across the river, close to the bridge, came a long, thin \"Hello-o-!\"\nJanet's eyes traced to the source of the call. On a jut of rock twenty feet or more above the water level stood two naked little figures, wraithlike against a spiral of smoke.\n\"Juanee's twins!\" Groneman exclaimed. \"Tugi-Chee and Maneto!\"\n\"Yes.\" Janet clutched his arm. \"They'reThat's too high! It's halfway up to the bridge. They can't dive from there!\"\n\"How high is it?\"\n\"I don't know. Only tell them not to dive; they'll listen to you!\"\n\"If I know those kids, they'll make it!\"\n\"Nine-year-old boys! How can they know what the river will do to them?\"\nThe call came again. Friendly. Urgent. \"Hello-o Miss Janet!\"\n\"They'rewaiting for us to signal... They want me to see them... Please, Dr. Mark, tell them it's too high!\"\n\"Wave to them, Janet. It's the only way to conquer your fear.\"\n\"No! How can you ask such a thing?\"\nGroneman raised his own arm as if to wave for her. Janet thrust it sharply aside, said nervously: \"II didn't realize they are so tall.... They're exactly the same height.... And their hair wet from the last divegleams like anthracite. Did you ever see such perfect bodies?\"\n\"You're evading, Janet. Wave to them.\"\n\"II can't! It would kill them to dive from there. The river's a devil!\"\n\"Wave, Janet. They'll come up. You'll see that they will.\"\n\"I can't, I tell you!\" Janet sprang back. \"The current! Listen to it, snarling as if it were alive! It is alive!\" She took a step forward. \"I'll wave,\" she said slowly, and raised one arm. \"You're cruel! Cruel when I thought you were kind.\"\n\"We see you, Maneto!\" Groneman shouted, pretending not to hear.\nThere was not a sound.... Then a single splash, a moment later an exultant, long cry. Janet tried to shut her eyes but her lids were frozen with fear. Then she saw themtwo black heads bobbing like corks on the water, four copper arms rising and falling in unison.\nGroneman, listening intently, said: \"They swim with almost no effort. It's beautiful.\"\nUnder his slow, cool voice, Janet began to relax. Juanee's boys were safe. No! She couldn't see them at all! There was nothing where they had been but a deep trough where a current had cut through! She gave a terrified scream. \"They've gone under!\"\n\"They'll come up. Keep your eyes open, Janet.\"\n\"Yes. Yes, I will. But isn't itShouldn't we do something?\"\n\"There they are,\" Groneman said with assurance, touching her arm.\n\"How could you tell?\"\n\"I heard the water, placid after the current, break above their heads. I could hear them gulp new breath.\"\nTears coursed down Janet's face. \"You do not need eyes,\" she said humbly.\n\"Can you see them, Janet? Have they come ashore?\"\n\"They'll pop up pretty quickly.\" Janet was surprised at her own assurance. \"They must have a trail that leads up and down to the waterand there they are, heads bashfully peeking around a boulder, their bodies out of sight.\"\n\"How you like that?\" the boys asked proudly.\n\"Fine!\" Groneman answered. \"That was a pretty swell dive! How do you judge your distance?\"\n\"We measure us. Every six moons we measure us,\" Maneto said.\n\"Five times we measure us. Ethli, noki, ta, tee, ostha,\" counted Tugi-Chee. \"Five times higher than our own heads we dive!\"\nAnd they scurried away to dress.\nJanet turned toward the car. \"We'll have to hurry if we get to the Goosenecks,\" she said.\nThe sun was setting when they reached the plateau and crossed to Lookout Point. They left the car and walked to the brink. Twelve hundred feet below lay the Great San Juan Goosenecks.\nJanet sighed raptly. She began, hesitantly: \"The gorge is gray-pink; misty, yet shot with spikes of gold from the sun. Far below us the Goosenecks build up. Layer upon layer, like pyramids. Each crusted stratum is smaller than the one before, until at the very top, hundreds of feet above, the mammoth lobes end in giant, tilted pancakes ready to slide from their dizzy height.\"\nGroneman's face lighted up. He said: \"Yes, I see it plainly.\"\nJanet's pulse quickened, her eyes shone, her voice deepened. \"There is nothing else like it in all the world!\" she breathed. \"Each meander, interlocking on alternate sides of the gorge, is connected to its parent wall by the thinnest of partitions. Mere necks that shape the river into gleaming platters for the stacks to rest upon.\" Her voice caught, tears glistened in her eyes, but she went on, after a deep, steadying breath. \"The river goes in and out around each curve, undercutting on the outside, building sand bars on the inside. Smooth. Relentless. Three miles to achieve a hundred yards. We'reFrom down there, we're but dots against the sky!\"\nHer voice took on new meaning, became the voice of a scriptural reader, hushed with reverence. \"Sunlight. Vastness. Strength. Blended into such spiritual grandeur that I can't breathe....\"\nGroneman's hand brushed across his sightless eyes. \"So shall the lame be made to walk and the blind to see,\" he said reverently.\nThey drove back through the scented desert night, and it was five years before Dr. Groneman returned to El Toro. Five years in which Janet turned steadfastly from the river, hoarding his last sentence there at the Goosenecks, wondering when she, the lame, would be made to walk, by faith and without fear.\nThe sun hung in its place in the hot dome of sky above El Toro with blistering intensity. Day after day through the long dry summer, Janet had watched it curl the leaves and sear the earth. Sand drifted across the paths and around the house, ankle deep, hotter than the sun and dryer than the wind that blew it there. Floors wore a constant film of dust and grit in spite of her efforts to keep them clean. Nothing escaped the ravages of the drought. Sand drifted through every crevice, sifted between the sheets of the beds, and lodged in the pockets and seams of clothing. Insects multiplied into a plague. Water stood hot in the barrels, and there was no ice to cool it for a drink.\nFive years! Janet poured the dishwater from her pan onto the few plants in the yard that she had stubbornly kept alive. Most of it went to the swing tree. Jerry and Paulette's swing treeplanted the day they were born.... Five years! Years in which Paul had seen his herds dwindle to half their number. Cattle, crazy from thirst, plunged over canyons at the smell of water they couldn't reach. Another year of this and Paul would be penniless, robbed of all he had so stubbornly achieved.... But what was the good of thinking about that?\nShe took her empty pan and went in out of the sun. As she came in, Paulette began to cry. \"I'm too hot,\" she moaned, \"and Jerry broke my fan.\"\nJanet smiled encouragement. \"Daddy will be home tonight, and he'll fan you with his big hat.\"\nPaulette was a lovely, golden-haired child, as different from her brother as day from night. Jerry was dark like Paul, tempestuous like his mother. Paulette, usually all smiles, was like neither of them. Rhae and Warren Newsbaum claimed her, spoiling her as much as Paul would let them. Every summer, regardless of rain or drought the Newsbaums came to their ranch in the desert. Paul, scoffing at first, had long ago added them to the list of his country's converts. Janet had never ceased to wonder at her sister's swift acceptance of everything and everyone in the whole country.\nOne more year of this, however, and the stoutest enthusiasm would wane. Summer after summer as the drought had persisted she had taken the children and gone East for a brief stay, merely to please Paul. It was too hot anywhere for comfort. This time she had refused to go. A few years from even the dearest place and one became a stranger. The noise of Washington frightened Paulette, and Jerry was restless and dissatisfied there. \"Kids in this town don't know how to play,\" he'd scoffed. \"They've never even shot a bow and arrow!\"\nWhen her father had died, the last tie was broken and this year she had stayed in San Juan.\n\"Mother, look!\" Jerry's excited tone brought Janet back to the present. \"There comes a strange car. I betcha it's coming here!\"\n\"Betcha?\" Janet reproved. \"Is that the way to talk?\"\n\"Bet your boots! Daddy says those words 'riginated right here in San Juan, and anything that 'riginates here is okay by me!\"\nJanet smiled above the clean dress she was holding over Paulette's head. Already this five-year-old son was fierce with loyalty. The little dress fell, crooked, over Paulette's head.\n\"Mother, you smother me!\" Paulette gasped.\nJanet straightened the dress absently. Jerry tugged at her sleeve. \"Aren't you the least bit excited?\" he questioned. \"Let's go out on the porch!\"\nPaulette had already dashed out to see who was coming. Jerry had waited for his mother. He always did, and it never failed to make Janet's heart leap, and to tighten her throat. She took his hard little hand and they ran to make up for lost time.\nThe car swung into the yard, sending a shower of sand into the air. \"They'll be drenched,\" Janet thought, and smiled at the incongruity of the term. She said: \"Jerry, I'll bet that's Uncle Warren's new car!\"\n\"It is, Mother!\" Paulette was already dancing up the path between Rhae and Warren Newsbaum.\n\"Only this minute I was thinking of you!\" Janet cried. \"Oh, I'm so glad you've come. But to what a place!\"\n\"Best country in the world!\" Jerry quoted. \"How do you do, Uncle Warren?\"\nWarren Newsbaum shook hands with his young nephew soberly. \"I'm fine, Jerry. And you're right about the country, son.\"\n\"Then we're glad you've come to El Toro,\" Jerry said, and led them grandly into the house.\n\"Jerry makes the most of company,\" Janet smiled behind his straight little back.\nWarren tossed her an assenting nod, and there was a tender twinkle in his eyes.\n\"Did you bring the house that's to look like El Toro?\" Paulette asked her Aunt Rhae.\n\"We did, Sweet,\" Rhae hugged her happily. \"It's in our pocket books.\"\n\"Then it isn't nearly as large as El Toro!\" Paulette said proudly.\n\"Where's Paul?\" Rhae asked, her arm affectionately around Janet.\n\"I'm ready for a little sparring again!\"\nJanet laughed appreciatively. \"Every time you come I expect it to be your last, the way you two fight. Paul will be here tonight.\"\n\"We'll stage a celebration,\" Rhae suggested.\n\"I hope Daddy'll like it,\" Jerry said.\nJanet flushed with embarrassment. Rhae and Warren laughed good naturedly.\n\"From the mouths of babes,\" Rhae quoted.\n\"I'm not a baby,\" Jerry said angrily. \"I'm five years old!\"\nWarren Newsbaum slapped him on the back. \"Right you are, old man,\" he said. \"Right you are.\"\nJerry flinched, but his dignity was fully restored.\nAfter dinner Janet put the children to bed. Her head throbbed after the long day of heat and the excitement of seeing her own folks again. Rhae had retired early, leaving Warren to sit on the porch with Janet, to wait for Paul.\n\"She wants to be fresh for the encounter,\" Warren laughed. \"Right now this heat has dulled even my enthusiasm.\"\nFor a while the two on the porch were silent. Finally Janet spoke: \"I can't think what's keeping Paul. He sent the foreman ahead to tell me he'd be home early this afternoon. The cattle are jumpy and dry. Anything can happen at a time like this!\"\n\"Here he comes, now,\" Newsbaum said cheerfully. \"Hear that horse?\"\nJanet was on her feet. \"That isn't Paul; he wouldn't be riding that hard. It's a runner! Something's happened!\"\nWarren Newsbaum's hand reached out in the dark to steady her.\n\"Miss Janet!\" Indian Joe's voice penetrated Janet's consciousness before she realized the riding had ceased.\n\"Tell me...\" Janet's voice was steady.\n\"There's been\"\n\"A stampede,\" Joe answered.\n\"Yes. I knew there would be. Will Mr. Paul come home?\"\n\"Yes, Miss Janet.\"\n\"Thanks, Joe. Goodnight. Goodnight, Warren.\"\nWarren understood Janet's need. \"Goodnight,\" he said, and left her to wait alone....\n(To be continued)\nChristmas on Tubuai in 1851 (Continued from page 751)\naway. I felt that he was right, and consented for them to feast their eyes as long as they wished.\nThen came the dinner, and such a feast! Pigs weighing as much as a hundred pounds roasted whole, plenty of wild chickens, fish of all kinds, poi, bread fruit, cocoanuts, with the fresh milk from them as a beverage, pineapples, bananas and many kinds of native fruit unknown in America. Each article of food, as it is prepared usually the day before, is wrapped in large leaves excluding the air, and piled in a heap resembling a small hay stack. Mats were spread for the guests to sit upon. A very few had a knife, fork or spoon. No dish washing, new dishes for every meal. A large palm leaf is placed before each person, and removed when the meal is finished. Leaves platted together formed the table cloth.\nWhen all was in readiness for the dinner Elder Franklin Grouard blessed the food and offered thanks for our multiplicity of blessings. After dinner we held a religious service. As evening came on we illuminated the house with all the glass lamps in the village. The lights threw over all a mantle of romance exceeding anything I had ever seen. Elder Jonathan Crosby playing the violin and our daughter Ellen the flutina, made the instrumental music; added thereto the sweet melody of human voices, made it seem in reality like the birthday of our blessed Savior.\nThe day was extremely warm, as December and January are the summer months here, and as I gazed at the scenery, beautiful beyond description, the tall stately cocoanut trees reaching toward the sky, verdure everywhere, the roar of the mighty ocean, it seemed I must be in a different world entirely from the one on which my parents, and all my relatives, save those who were with me, lived, wrapped in ice and snow, as I knew they would be on this day in far away Canada and New England; but I knew their love and blessings were being wafted to us, and that in their hearts, as in ours, glowed the love of the lowly Master and the Spirit of Christmas.\nSupply of Relief Society Songs Exhausted\nThe General Board regrets to announce that the supply of Relief Society Songs is exhausted, and because of the shortage of metal it will be impossible to issue a new edition at this time.\nTheology\nArticles of Faith Lesson 22Religious Liberty and Toleration Tuesday, March 7, 1944\nArticle 11: We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship, how, where, or what they may.\nLesson Aim: To show that religious liberty and toleration are principles safeguarded by our inspired Constitution, and that they are supported by all Sacred Scriptures; that they enable men to inherit whatever kingdom of glory they desire in righteousness, but that intolerance is an enemy to God and impedes the progress of man.\nCONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 22, TALMAGE'S, ARTICLES OF FAITH\nMan's Right to Freedom in Worship\nThe Latter-day Saints proclaim their unqualified allegiance to the principles of religious liberty and toleration. Freedom to worship Almighty God as the conscience may dictate, they affirm to be one of the inherent and inalienable rights of humanity. The inspired framers of our charter of national independence proclaimed to the world, as a self-evident truth, that the common birthright of humanity gives to every man a claim to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nWhat is Worship?\nThe derivation of the term suggests an answer. It comes to us as the lineal descendant of a pair of Anglo-Saxon words, meaning worthy, and condition or state, and connotes the thought of worthy-ship. The worship of which one is capable depends upon his comprehension of the worthiness characterizing the object of his reverence. Man's capacity for worship is a measure of his comprehension of God. True worship cannot exist where there is no reverence or love for the object. Knowledge is essential to worship; man cannot adequately serve God in ignorance. Worship is the voluntary homage of the soul. Formalism in worship is acceptable only so far as it is accompanied by an intelligent devoutness. The most acceptable form of worship is that which rests on an unreserved compliance with the laws of God as the worshiper has learned their purport.\nReligious Intolerance\nThe Latter-day Saints accept as inspired the constitutional provision by which religious liberty within our own nation is professedly guarded, that no law shall be made \"respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\" and they confidently believe that with the spread of enlightenment throughout the world a similar guaranty will be acquired by every nation. Intolerance has been the greatest hindrance to progress in every period of time; yet under the sable cloak of perverted zeal for religion, nations, while boasting of their civilization, and professed ministers of the Gospel of Christ, have stained the pages of the world's history with the record of such unholy deeds of persecution as to make the heavens weep. Christ, in His ministry among the people of Israel, saw with compassionate sorrow the spiritual and intellectual bondage of the times, and declared unto them the saving word: \"The truth shall make you free\" (John 8:32).\nIntolerance is Unscriptural\nThe teachings of our Lord breathe the spirit of forbearance and love even to enemies. Hatred was not countenanced even toward foes. His instructions were: \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven....\" (Matt. 5:44, 45)\nToleration is not Acceptance\nIt is in nowise inconsistent for Latter-day Saints to boldly proclaim the conviction that their Church is the accepted one, the only one entitled to the designation \"Church of Jesus Christ,\" and the sole earthly repository of the eternal Priesthood in the present age, and yet to willingly accord kind treatment and a recognition of sincerity of purpose to every soul or sect honestly professing Christ.\nMan is Accountable for His Acts\nThe unbounded liberality and tolerance with which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regards other religious denominations, and the teachings of the Church respecting the assurance of final redemption for all men except the few who have fallen so far as to have committed the unpardonable sin, thereby becoming sons of Perdition, may suggest the erroneous conclusion that we believe that all so redeemed shall be admitted to equal powers, privileges, and glories in the kingdom of heaven. Far from this, the Church proclaims the doctrine of many and varied degrees of glory, which the redeemed will inherit in accordance with their merits.\nGraded Glories\nTo the apostles, the Messiah said: \"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also\" (John 14:2-3).\nA fuller knowledge of this subject has been imparted in the present dispensation. From a revelation given in 1832, we learn that three great kingdoms or degrees of glory are established, known as the Celestial, the Terrestrial, and the Telestial. Far below the last and least of these, is the state of eternal punishment prepared for the sons of Perdition (Doctrine and Covenants: Sec. 76).\nThe Kingdoms with Respect to One Another\nThe three kingdoms of widely differing glories are severally organized on a plan of gradation (See Doctrine and Covenants: Sec. 76; 131:1; also II Cor. 12:2). It is reasonable to believe, in the absence of direct revelation by which alone absolute knowledge of the matter could be acquired, that, in accordance with God's plan of eternal progression, advancement within each of the three specified kingdoms will be provided for; though as to possible progress from one kingdom to another the scriptures make no positive affirmation. Eternity is progressive; perfection is relative; the essential feature of God's living purpose is its associated power of eternal increase.\nThe Sons of Perdition\nWe learn of another class of souls whose sins are such as to place them beyond the present possibility of repentance and salvation. These are called sons of Perdition.\nSUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE\nSuggested Songs\n\"Come, O Thou King of Kings,\" Parley P.

At the beginning of the class period, the attention of class members should be called to this outline with the suggestion that they note the development of the lesson in accordance with the outline.\nIn the early editions of the Articles of Faith, by James E. Talmage, a series of questions and suggestive exercises were included. The 15 questions included for this lesson (Chap. 22) might be copied and at the beginning of the class distributed among 15 class members, one question to an individual. Persons receiving the questions should be informed that answers to the questions will be found in the presentation of the lesson; they should be told to follow the lesson carefully so as to be prepared to answer the questions when called upon to do so.

We cannot go into the presence of some people without being lifted up in our hearts and without coming away feeling better. Some people call forth the best that is in us. They give us a nobler estimate of ourselves, inspire us with renewed hope and confidence. Such companions are a priceless source of strength.\nThere is other poverty in the world besides material poverty, other suffering than physical suffering. People may have enough of the world's goods and still be in social poverty. Through mistakes, disappointment, sorrow, and failure, men and women become discouraged, hopeless, and beaten in spirit. Such people need the impact of cheerful, hopeful, radiant people who have personality to bestow. One may give people things and leave them much as they were before; but to impart hope, courage, and self-confidence not only changes circumstances but it changes people.\nWe all need friends; we cannot live without them. The way to cultivate friendship is to be friendly. The Savior of mankind was a perfect example in this respect, as He was in all other respects. He drew all men to Him, lifted them up, made them better. The two disciples who walked with Him on His way to Emmaus, after He had left them, said to one another: \"Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked with us by the way...?\"\nTo minister in this way to others is the high mission of Relief Society. The service rendered in this respect is priceless. The world needs such service. Friendship is a fundamental need of the world. No man is sufficient unto himself. Every man requires friends.\nNext to the warmth and encouragement that comes from personal friendships, is the friendship of good books which are the products of the best minds of all the ages. If the good and great of our time cannot personally cross our thresholds and visit with us, they can enrich us through their writings. Great persons of the past can also contribute to our well-being: Franklin can aid us with his practical wisdom; Milton can sing to us of Paradise; Shakespeare can reveal to us the world of imagination and the workings of the human heart. Although one may be poor and his home may be humble, he can enjoy the society of the master spirits of the world through good books.\nDiscussion\n1. Why are friends essential to happy normal living?\n2. In what ways do we draw strength from our companions? From books?\n3. How may we enrich the lives of our companions and bring out the best that is in them?

Without being conscious of it, the family in such a home suffers infinitely more friction, loss of time, strength, and money than is necessary, and the haphazard aimless living in such a home also leaves an unmistakable stamp upon the housewife.\nTo have system and organization in housekeeping one should know:\n1. What is to be done\n2. Who is to do it\n3. When is it to be done\nThese are the chief requisites for the successful working out of housekeeping ideals, and bring ease and comfort of mind. Applying this knowledge each day, the housekeeper may find more time for work and enjoyment outside the home, conscious that she is not neglecting her first dutycare of home and family.\nThe time has come the housewife says To write of many things Of shoes and sheets and paring knives, Of stains and curtain rings.\nAnd so today we shall discuss such things as windows, shades, and curtains. We all realize the importance of windows to the houses, because they are the means whereby air and sunlight enter the room. In the past, windows were primarily regarded as something one looked through. Now they are regarded as accessories to the home to be kept shining like one's bracelets. Emily Post tells us in her book The Personality of a House that \"windows are the smiles of a house.\" No window can be a smile unless it sparkles with cleanliness.\nIt is not hard to clean windows if they are not too dirty. To polish them, use real chamois, which may at first seem rather expensive but which will give fine service and last a long time. A new chamois must be washed a few times to remove the oil. Afterwards, it need only be wrung out of cold water before using; after using, it should be rinsed in clear water and dried in air without heat.\nTo clean badly soiled windows wash them with a mixture of warm water and household ammonia or vinegar in the following proportions: two tablespoons household ammonia to two quarts of warm water or two tablespoons vinegar to two quarts of warm water. Vinegar is especially good for cleaning the outside of windows as the acid in the vinegar dissolves the lime deposit on the glass left by rain or sprinklers. Other good mixtures for window cleaning are two tablespoons borax to two quarts warm water or two tablespoons kerosene to two quarts warm water. Kerosene is very good for dissolving dirt and grease. Any of the above solutions should be applied with a clean cloth and polished with a chamois or clean linen. Soapy water streaks the glass unless it has been entirely removed by a second washing with clear water.\nWashing windows at a high level is dangerous. Stools or stepladders upon which one stands should be firm and secure. Windows should be kept in repair. If the windows are loose, thin wedges might be made and attached with cords to the window casings so that they can be easily pushed in beside a rattling window sash. Also, the shutter fastenings should be kept in repair.\nAwnings should not be kept up the year round, but should be taken down and stored throughout the winter. Screens should be taken down, washed, thoroughly dried, and stored for the winter. Screens made of copper or bronze wire are best, as they do not rust.\nVenetian blinds are fast gaining in popularity. They are regarded by many people as more attractive in appearance than the roller shades. They perform with greater efficiency the work of regulating light and air. They are easily raised or lowered and can be held rigid at any height. To clean them, wash with a cloth wrung out of mild, warm soap suds, wipe with a cloth wrung out of clear warm water, and then dry. They can also be cleaned with a paint cleaner. Curtains, i.e., window hangings, do more than any other single item of decoration to give the room a finished and livable air. Color schemes in a room may be perfect, floor coverings beautiful, furnishings lovely and charmingly arranged, but if the windows are just so many holes in the wall, admitting a harsh glare, the room will resist all efforts to make it homelike. The light may be toned and diffused with appropriate curtains of suitable fabrics. The topic of curtains is a big and important one, but must be studied in relation to the windows which are to be decorated. Suggestions for Discussion 1. Describe improved types of windows, window shades, and screens, and comment  upon the desirable features of have found helpful in cleaning windows. Each. 2. Discuss methods of cleaning windows that are located in the second story of a house. 3. Give suggestions on methods that you Reference America's Housekeeping Book, Sec. 14, page 169. Literature The Bible 38 Literature - Lesson 6A Bible Drama Tuesday, March 21, 1944 ISDOM literature of the Hebrew people rises to its highest peak in the \"Book of Job.\" Here is a drama of superb artistry, portraying the philosophy of life as revealed through the Chosen People. Through living characters, vital problems are lifted into the clear, and saving truths are driven home. Even God Himself, speaking out of the whirlwind, plays a leading role in this Wisdom Drama. Briefly presented, the story of Job is as follows: Job is a wealthy man, ripe in years and steadfast. Nothing, it would seem, is lacking for his complete satisfaction and happiness. God is pleased with his servant Job; yet, He permits the Adversary to put Job to crucial tests to prove his integrity. Of a sudden Job is shorn of his riches. His flocks and herds are stolen, his servants slain, and even his sons are cruelly murdered. Yet, in the face of these losses and searching sorrows, Job utters no complaint, but holds true to his faith in God, saying, The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, Blessed be the name of the Lord. Failing to shake Job by this first attack, the Adversary strikes at the body of Job himself. He is smitten with a plague of boils, covering him from head to foot. In his suffering and pain, he goes out-of-doors to sit upon an ash heap and bemoan his fate, crying out, Let the day perish wherein I was born And the night in which it was said, \"There is a man child conceived.\" In his anguish, the persecuted man gives way to the wish that he had never come to earth, but had remained in some blessed place There the wicked cease from troubling And there the weary be at rest. \"Wherefore,\" he wails, \"is light given to him that is in misery?\" and \"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?\" LESSON DEPARTMENT In this extremity, Job's three friends, who have come to comfort him, endeavor to explain to the tried man some cause for his suffering. One of them, Eliphaz, begins: If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking? Behold thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands * * * But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest;; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. Then comes the basic suggestion that Job's suffering is the result of sin. Eliphaz continues: Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off? According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same. Job, however, refuses to accept this shallow argument. 'There are other causes for suffering than just sin. Yet, he says,: If I have sinned, what can I do unto thee, O thou watcher of men? * * * And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, And take away mine iniquity? Then Bildad, another of the friends, upbraiding Job for his assumption of sinlessness and his refusal to accept their argument, says, Doth God pervert judgment? * * If thou wert pure and upright, surely now he would awake for thee. * * * Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil doers. To which Job replies, Of a truth J know that it is so; 7169 But how can man be just with God? * Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered? Yet, he continues: He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. Then, Zophar, the third friend, takes up the argument, saying, Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes. * * Know therefore that God exacteth of thee Less than thine iniquity deserveth. Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection? To which Job retorts: No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you. Then he strikes out a bit savagely at their arguments, saying among other things: With Him is strength and sound wisdom The deceived and the deceiver are His. * * & Though he slay me, yet will I wait for him, Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him. He also shall be my salvation For a godless man shall not come before him. Almost in despair he continues, Man that is born of a woman Is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down, He fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not. Then he cries, Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me! 770 Then comes the eternal question: If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, till my release should come. The friends of Job persist in their arguing, even taunting him for his stubbornness, his refusal to admit sin, and his trust in God's judgment, until finally he cries out: How long will ye vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words? Oh, that my words were now written! * * * That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock forever! Then with fervor he declares: For I know that my Redeemer liveth, And that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though, after my skin, worms destroy this body, Yet in my flesh shall I see God. (Job 19:25-26) The drama continues with the arguments being flung rather fiercely back and forth until the goaded Job rises, and with uplifted hands demands of his \"miserable comforters\" a \"bill of particulars.\" He challenges them, in effect, to point wherein he has failed, when he has \"walked in vanity\" or been deceitful or been covetous or oppressed his servants or withheld from the poor or not shared with the fatherless. 'Then he concludes: If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, * * & If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, If my land cry out against me And the furrows thereof weep together; If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And cockle instead of barley! The words of Job are ended! At this outburst of self-defense, another actor steps in. Elihu, a young man, who because of his youth has refrained from taking part, joins in the discussion. His elders having finished, he presents another reason, as he thinks, for Job's suffering. In essence, it has come not because of any sins committed, but rather because of the evil of self-justification. Elihu says, For Job hath said, \"I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right; Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.\" Job makes no reply; neither do his three friends reply to the words of the young man, permitting him to argue on with words upon words. While he speaks, signs of an approaching 'thunderstorm appear in the sky. Then comes a whirlwind, and finally out of the whirlwind comes a voice saying: =~ Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding ' Who determined the measure thereof, if thou knowest? * Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the cornerstones thereof; When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy? * * & Or who shut up the sea with doors,. * * & LESSON DEPARTMENT And said, \"Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; And here shalt thy proud waves be stayed?\". Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began? * Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee e ek Hast thou comprehended the breadth of the earth? Declare, if thou knowest it all. Thus, with searching question upon question are the awed listeners brought to face life's mysteries, and to feel the power and majesty of God, Creator of the universe. With masterful, poetic strokes the wonders of the world are sketched in picturesque lines like these: Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow? *  Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, Or a way for the lightning of the thunder; To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; * & To satisfy the waste and desolate ground; And to cause the tender grass to spring forth xe oe Who provideth for the raven his food, When his young ones cry unto God, And wander for lack of meat?  Hast thou given the horse his might? Hast thou clothed his neck with quivering mane? * Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, And make her nest on high? Then another trenchant question: Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it. A lull comes in the storm, and Job, humbly acknowledging God's might and wisdom, says, 771 Behold I am of small account; what shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth. With a few other swift strokes, the drama is rounded to a close. Job's humility and steadfastness are approved; his friends are rebuked for \"not speaking of me that which is right, as my servant Job hath.\" They are required to repent and make sac rifice. Job, on the other hand, is rewarded for his righteousness, and restored to health and wealth and happiness. He has passed the soulsearching test. Discussion and Activities.

No sooner is one victory won than there looms large before us the next conquest to be undertaken. OT only is America a land of opportunity, but it has a people who like to go forth to conquer new land and to bring to a realization their best hopes and ideals. The native American is inventive and resourceful and loves to blaze new trails into the hidden secrets of nature and to develop the resources of the country. This means not only wealth for the millions, but the realizing of those ambitions which mean much for the happiness of people. From the beginning of our history, from the days of early Virginia and early New England, the people have been compelled to conquer the soil or perish in the wilderness. They have gone forth and created villages, farms, and cities out of the land which for ages knew only Indians, wild animals, and virgin forests. They have built schools and churches, colleges and libraries, museums and concert halls. They have built beautiful homes, roads, and bridges that have made contact with their neighbors possible. They have done everything to bring about a peaceful and happy country. \"No sooner is one victory won, than there looms large before us the next conquest to be undertaken.\"  Brander Matthews The American people have accomplished great and lasting things for the development and building up of their country. Within one hundred years, space has almost been annihilated by the building of railroads and telegraph lines. Great skyscrapers have replaced the old business blocks. Streets are paved and lights make homes and trees and the earth gleam and twinkle. Mr. Frederic Harrison, writing about Americans and their will to make successes of their lives, says, \"The zeal for learning, justice, and humanity lies deep in the American heart.\" Dr. Hugh Munsterberg, one of the noted German philosophers of a half century ago, aptly remarked that \"the Americans have more ways of realizing the meaning of life than have any other people.\" Some critics of American life in general have held that Americans interpret the word \"success\" to mean material prosperity, the attainment of a comfortable fortune, and the acquisition of the \"assured position which money generally gives.\" While this standard may be prevalent among a certain class of Americans, it is far from the truth, for the American 'people have been and are LESSON DEPARTMENT a Christian people, and the two hundred and forty-five different Christian sects in this country bear witness that Americans strive to realize the spiritual life over and above the material. I have before me a very long list of American men and women who have been successful in life and who are typical of millions of others. Although all have aimed at some great goal of human endeavor, no two have aimed at the same goal nor attained the same plane of success; yet each one has added something to the world's betterment. The list includes inventors, engineers, architects, sculptors, painters, musicians, physicians, lawyers, statesmen, soldiers, poets, literary men, journalists, and philanthropists. Behind the activities of these men there has been a \"strong ethical sentiment\" and a \"strenuous moral purpose\" which can only flourish when deeply rooted in idealism. 'The average American may be a practical man, but he is a man moved by high purposes. Lincoln was a practical politician, but he was an idealist. In fact, the idealism of the \"common\" men of America has become known the world over. It was \"poor John Fitch\" who gave us our first steamboat, and a humble teacher who lived in an attic gave us the cotton gin. Americans are often asked if their country has contributed any one distinct thing or movement for the betterment of humanity. The words of President Eliot of Harvard University, included in Lesson 10, give answer to this question. He said that America had made five important contributions to the advancement of civilization: first, we have 773 done more than any other people to further peace-keeping and to substitute legal arbitration for the brute conflict of war; second, we have set a splendid example of the broadest religious tolerationeven though Holland had first shown us how; third, we have made evident the wisdom of universal manhood suffrage; fourth, by our welcoming newcomers from all parts of the earth, we have proved that men belonging to a. Great variety of races are fit for political freedom; finally, we have been successful in diffusing material wellbeing among the whole population to an extent unparalleled in any other country of the world. \"These five American contributions to civilization,\" says Professor Brander Matthews, \"are all of them the result of the practical side of the American character.\" President Eliot says that they are \"triumphs of reason, enterprise, courage, faith, and justice over passion, selfishness, inertness, timidity, and distrust.\" The schools and churches of America have always been insistent that every young person should have an aim in life, something loved for its own sake. Children have had certain standards of success laid constantly before them. An example of such teachings is the famous lecture of Ralph Waldo Emerson entitled \"The American Scholar\" which was delivered at Harvard University in 1837. Emerson emphasized the importance of understanding the past history of mankind, pointing out that from the books of the wise men of all ages we receive the influence of the past. \"Books are the best of things, well used; abused, among the worst.\" And then he adds: \"When 774 he can read God directly, the hour is too precious to be wasted in other men's transcripts of their readings.\" He closes his famous address by saying that \"when men love men, it will be a wall of defense and a wreath of joy around all. A nation of men will for the first time exist, because each believes himself inspired by the Divine Soul which also inspires all men.\" Another fine example of university influence is found in the lecture of Professor Albert Bushnell Hart of Harvard, entitled: \"The Hope of Democracy.\" A few sentences will throw light on what Professor Hart said and taught: He spoke of the ideals that American democracy has given to the world and what the pioneer American has taught us in subduing a continent by sacrifice and labor. Then he adds, \"As a part of this process the Americans have established once and for all the possibility of a democracy in an area immense and various.... The Federal Union covers half a continent, and includes communities of many kinds, fastened together by bands of steel. The railroad section hand, the fireman on a river steamer, the foreignborn laborer hewing a tunnel through the Rocky Mountains, have been helping to weld the Republic together, and thus to transfer popular government to children's children.\" A true democracy must be founded on a lasting ideal. It must not only grow from beneath, but it must reach out to God in its life. The wrongs that have been done in our Democratic Government have not been because of democracy as such, but in the incompleteness of man's understanding of democracy. Man must be trained, educated, lifted. He must learn to know his ideal worth and lift himself to it. \"True liberty consists in not wanting for ourselves that which we will not grant to all. It is entering into the common life, putting aside special privileges, denying ambitions of indulgence or of power; being ready, not only to serve the common-weal, aye, but to suffer as well.\" One can hardly think of any standards of thought more sublime than those we have quoted from Emerson and Professor Hart. In spite of much that may seem like evidence to the contrary, the American people as a whole are not setting up false standards of success. 'The writer remembers one of the noble stories that his father used to relate to his children. Father was a graduate of the medical college of the University of New York, and his graduation took place in the old Cooper Institute. He always loved to speak about Peter Cooper and his funeral which was attended by thousands of people \"who held him in high regard because he had made the world a better place in which to live.\" \"The average American clings sturdily to the belief that public service, in office or out of it, is the true gage of life. The most useful citizen is in fact the most successful; and it is those who have given loyal service to the community whom the community holds in highest regard.\" Truly and nobly has America established high standards of success. The Gospel of Jesus Christ, restored in this land, embodies the highest and most vital standard of success. The Gospel is vital in its interpretation of human life, and the life lived in the light of this interpretation is the successful life. The LESSON DEPARTMENT Gospel gives to mankind the doctrine of Jesus Christ, as He Himself taught it. It is the divine plan for the redemption. And salvation of man. It is with reverent thought and deep feeling that one writes about the Prophet Joseph Smith and the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Through the Prophet - Joseph, man's relationship to his Heavenly Father became known. There was a new vision of the Kingdom of God in which the purpose of God was to culminate in the reign of righteousness upon the earth. God reigns in heaven and in earth. He is the rightful King of nations and the source of supreme good to mankind. The fact that the restoration was reserved for our day, fills us with a deepening sense of our responsibility and duty; and the knowledge that a new standard of success has been revealed from the throne of God. How true are these words: Not what we have but what we use; Not what we see, but what we choose These are the things that mar or bless The sum of human happiness, Not as we take but as we give; Not as we pray but as we live These are the things that make for peace, Both now and after time shall cease.

Stories from the Book of Mormon Lesson 5Deliverance of Alma and Amulek from Prison For optional use of Relief Societies in stakes and missions in countries other than the United States, in lieu of social science lessons. Tuesday, March 28, 1944 Note: For the full effect of this lesson it is imperative that the teacher and the class have at hand the Book of Mormon. Lesson objective: To show that \"the Lord gives us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance.\" One of the many great and powerful prophets who cried repentance unto the people of America was Alma the Younger. His conversion to the cause of Christ was similar to that of the ancient Apostle Paul. Alma, too, was visited by an angel who reproved him for his acts against the Lord and then brought him to a true repentance that set him face forward on the path that leads to eternal life. Knowing the anguish 776 of soul for wrongdoing and also the joy found in the deliverance from sin, Alma spoke with words of fervor the call of repentance: \"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!\" (Alma 29:1). Many of Alma's missionary experiences are among the most dramatic to be found recorded in the Book of Mormon. Such is the case in his warnings to the wicked city of Ammonihah, at which time he was accompanied by another servant of the Lord, named Amulek. This story illustrates beautifully the strength the Lord gives to one having unwavering faith in Christa strength even unto the deliverance from enemies. The moving story to be used as a background for this lesson can best be gained by an oral class reading of the events that provide the setting as well as the actual dramatic happenings of Alma's visit to Ammonihah. Elder George Reynolds in his book, The Story of the Book of Mormon, lays a colorful setting, describing the missionary activities that lead up to the imprisonment of Alma and Amulek. The Reynold's account follows. It is suggested that this be read, followed immediately by a complete reading of chapter 14 of the Book of Alma. The questions for active reading and discussion given below will provide opportunity to seek more of the plain and precious truths of the Gospel which appear in the spirited words of Alma and Amulek. \"The next year (B. C. 82), Alma turned his face westward. He visited the land of Melek, where his labors were crowned with abundant blessings. Having satisfied himself with the good that he had accomplished, he traveled three days' journey on the north of the land of Melek, to a great and corrupt city called Ammonihah. There he found a godless people, filled with the falsehoods of Nehor, and committing all manner of abominations without repentance, because they cherished the flattering lie, as the foundation of their creed, that all men would be saved. This city was in the hands of a-corrupt clique of judges and lawyers, who stirred up sedition, tumult and rioting, that they might make money out of the suits that followed such disturbances. Further than this, they were secretly plotting to overthrow the government, and rob the people of their highly prized liberties. Among such a people Alma labored in vain; none would listen, none would obey, none offered him rest and food. Scorn and mockery were his reward; and he was spat upon, maltreated and cast out of the city. \"Weary in body and sick at heart because of the iniquity of the people after many fruitless efforts, fervent prayers and long fastings, Alma sought some other people more worthy of salvation's priceless gifts. He bent his way toward the city of Aaron; but as he journeyed, an angel of the Lord (that same angel that beforetime had been the agent in his conversion to God) stood before him and blessed him. He told him to lift up his heart and rejoice, for because of his faithfulness he had great cause to do so. The angel then directed Alma to return to the sin-cursed city he had just left, and proclaim unto its citizens the awful message that LESSON DEPARTMENT except they repented the Lord would destroy them. \"Speedily the prophet obeyed the angel's words. By another road he drew near the doomed city, which he entered by its south gate. As he passed in, he hungered, and asked a man whom he met, Will you give to an humble servant of God something to eat? With joy the man (and, strange though it appear, he was a rich man) took him to his home and fed, clothed and lodged him. Furthermore, Amulek, for such was his name, told Alma that he also had received a visit from a holy angel who had informed him of the high priest's coming, and directed him to receive him into his house. Then Alma_blessed Amulek and all his household, and tarried with them and recruited his strength under the generous hospitality which Amulek's home afforded. But his rest was not to be a lengthened one; the people waxed stronger in sin; the cup of their iniquity was nearly full. Go, came the word of the Lord, Go forth, and take with thee my servant Amulek, and prophesy unto this people, saying, Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, Except ye repent, I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, I will not turn my fierce anger away. Filled with the Holy Ghost, these servants of God went forth and valiantly delivered their terrible message. \"One of those who most bitterly opposed Alma and Amulek was a lawyer named Zeezrom.... No matter what Alma and his companion said, Zeezrom could twist it from its proper meaning; find blasphemy and heresy in the sublime truths of the Gospel, and extract treason from the simplest of God's laws. He questioned and cross-questioned, he 777 promised and threatened, he twisted and turned, he abused and vilified, but all to no purpose, he was caught in his own trap. His heaven-inspired opponents made manifest his thoughts and intentions, they exposed his lying, they overthrew his sophistries and, with a power more than human, they exhibited the blackness of his heart. As they proceeded, the power of God increased upon them, their words grew yet more forcible until Zeezrom himself felt their power. As his corruptions were laid bare he began to tremble, first with rage, then with fear. Bad as he was, he was not the worst among that people, and when once he realized the power he was combatting, his heart began to acknowledge its guilt.\" Story of the Book of Mormon, pp. 152-154, 1888 edition. Questions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the passage given to discover plain and precious truths of the Gospel brought to light in the Book of Mormon. If time permits, have each member of the class 'add a passage of her own selection from within the Book of Mormon (Alma, chapters 4 to 16)a passage that has brought new meaning to a Gospel truth. 1. How is it that with a portion of the Gospel as understood by the churches of the world today men can so easily be led away to destruction? Read Alma 12:1-12. 2. What is the true significance of the fall of Adam and the probationary state of man? Read Alma 12:12-37. The next question may be used if needed for class activity, or it may be assigned for home study. 3. How did a faith in Christ unto salvation deliver Zeezrom? Read Alma 15:1-12.
