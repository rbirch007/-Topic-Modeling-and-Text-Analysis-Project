CAMPAIGNS
THE table of accomplishment with respect tocampaigns during 1942 shows, in the middle of page 484, the eight stakes and two missions which procured subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of their Relief Society members. These stakes and the Western States Mission were asked to send brief reports of methods used in achieving their high rates. The reports received are published herewith in the same order in which these stakes and mission are listed in the table, followed by one report from an additional stakeOakland.
Because of distance and time limitations, no report could be procured from the Australian Mission which stands at the head of all stakes and missions in the Church with a subscription rate of 122 per cent. This mission has had a consistently high rate during the past few years. June Cannon Orme is the mission Relief Society president and Violet Cook is the mission Magazine representative.
South Los Angeles Stake (California)
UNDER the direction of Stake Relief Society President Hazel Till NeVille, and her first counselor, Ruth Ryan, in charge of Magazine work, and Rosine Bauer, stake Magazine representative, the South Los Angeles Stake achieved a Magazine subscription rate of 102.5 per cent in 1942, exceeding its own excellent rate of 86 per cent of the year before. Following are excerpts from statements from these three leaders:
From Hazel T. NeVilleWe are indeed happy our stake was so willing and able to achieve our goal of 100 per cent of our enrollmentto procure 872 subscriptions as compared with a membership of 851. This was accomplished through the fine leadership of Sisters Ryan and Bauer, and our faithful ward representatives. No high pressure methods were used. It seemed every one concerned felt it was a work of love. We, as a stake, feel the Magazine is greatly needed at this time. We need to be buoyed up in spirit, and to be reassured that all things work together for good in the lives of those who serve the Lord. The strongest appeal in our Magazine work was the self-help concept. The point of attack was what the Magazine had to offer in opportunities for spiritual uplift and intellectual growth. We felt it was our opportunity to plant and make grow a testimony of the Master's work, to stimulate women to think, to read, to act. We want our Relief Society women to really live, to discover for themselves the great sustaining power of a strong religious faith. We are proud of our workers' accomplishment and feel sure the Magazine will inspire and direct the women of our stake for good.
From Counselor Ruth Ryan:
Goal Set First a goal was set"a Magazine for every member." Ward representatives and

presidents met with us and agreed upon this goal.
Methods Used Special group assignments were carried out by means of names given to a group of women, each of whom was to call upon a number of homes and introduce Magazine. By this method one ward secured fifty new subscriptions.
Encouraging letters were sent out to the wards each month enclosing a self-addressed postcard to return as a report on ward activity.
Excerpt from Magazine given in Relief Society meeting once a month by a well-prepared person.
Two-and-one-half-minute talks on Sunday based on material in the Magazine, with no sales talk interjected.

From Rosine Bauer, Magazine RepresentativeIn 1942, the month of June was selected as the month for a campaign. All new families were to be contacted in all the wards to obtain as many new subscriptions as possible. All officers and visiting teachers were asked to cooperate and give their support. There was a two-fold purpose in having this campaign in June: First, the new subscriber receives the July issue which contains the first lessons for the coming year; Second, a June campaign does not conflict with campaigns for other Church magazines.
Thorough instructions and helpful suggestions were given to ward Magazine representatives at special meetings and by means of mailed material. Great emphasis is given to the importance of following up promptly on renewals as they occur from month to month. It is realized that the united effort of stake and ward officers, as well as of the Magazine representatives,
is essential to accomplishment of the established goal and that it is important for the Magazine representative to realize that the Magazine is a valuable spiritual, and temporal guide to its readers.
Gift subscriptions were received at Theoffice at Christmas time in 1942 from each of the thirteen officers and class leaders of the Walnut Park Ward of the South Los Angeles Stake. These were for Relief Society women in faraway places or missionaries.
San Diego Stake (California)
MARY McKAY CHRISTIANSEN, president of San Diego Stake Relief Society, whose first counselor, Carolyn Westover, also serves as stake Magazine representative, submitted the following report:
The degree of success attained by San Diego Stake in the Magazine campaign was due to the close cooperation of stake and ward representatives, checking on expirations as listed on the pink slips, monthly reports of progress, and frequent suggestions on methods of obtaining new subscriptions. Giving encouragement to representatives, and having them feel the importance of their position, gave stimulus to their efforts. When the stake preparation meeting was held at the beginning of the season's work, they were part of the group receiving instructions. A luncheon held between sessions, where they were especially honored for their achievements, was a fitting climax to a program given on the merits of the Magazine. The visiting teachers on their monthly calls have opened a way for subscriptions by drawing attention to articles printed in the Magazine and explaining the benefits and pleasure of having it in the home. With the added support of bishops and the cooperation of all Relief Society women, the Magazine campaign was brought to a successful close, which after all is only a challenge for bigger and better accomplishments. NOTES FROM THE FIELD Big Horn Stake (Wyoming) BIC HORN. STAKE of which Hulda M. Lynn is stake Relief Society president, is another stake which has maintained a high Magazine subscription rate for several years. Ann E. Gwynn, the stake Magazine representative, writes: Early in 1940, we divided our stake into two geographical sections, and called meetings at both places to which we invited the ward presidents and counselors, the ward Magazine representatives, and any others who would care to come. These meetings were in charge of our stake Magazine representative. 'The purpose was to instill into the minds of the sisters the need for the Magazine, and the benefit to them if they would study its contents. Our stake Relief Society president and all board members pledged themselves to help in every way they could, by taking more than one subscription and in other ways. This enthusiasm seemed to carry over to the ward presidents, their officers, and ward Magazine representatives, who in turn worked out ways and means to make it possible for the sisters to get the Magazine. We found that when we were all enlisted for the single purpose of selling our Magazine to the sisters, and with it our Relief Society work, that in unity there is strength, that our Heavenly Father did bless our efforts, as He will continue to do if we are humble and prayerful. Four wards of Big Horn Stake, Worland, Burlington, Kane, and Basin Branch sent gift subscriptions during 1942 to be distributed at the discretion of the Magazine office to missionaries or others in need of the Magazine. San Francisco Stake (California) LOUISE E. ARNSTEN, who serves both as secretary and Magazine representative of the San Francisco Stake, under direction of 499 Stake Relief Society President Esther D. Stephens, reports: Any success that we have had along this line was due particularly to the efforts put forth by our ward representatives. Our stake is a large one in distances covered. Some of our wards cover an area of 30 miles. Due to the restrictions placed upon travel in these days, I, as stake representative, have not been able to contact them personally, as we did formerly. During our intensive drive, which we hold from June fifteenth to July fifteenth each year, we meet together at one of the homes for a luncheon meeting. Here each of the ward representatives outlines her past methods as well as those she intends to employ during the current drive. Ideas are exchanged in this manner. I have always found that the ward representatives keep an accurate personal record of the subscriptions in their respective wards. Each of them has been very faithful in keeping in contact with her subscribers and sceing to it that subscriptions are renewed and kept up to date, as well as obtaining new ones. As has been mentioned before, they are lirnited as to travel facilities. Many of them are actively engaged in numerous activities outside their homes and Church now, such as Red Cross, and defense work, or at least some members of their immediate families are, all of which causes them to have less time than ever before. In spite of these handicaps, however, they are doing their work faithfully and well. We are very proud of the fact that Sister Josephine Danford of Sunset Ward was able to obtain 104 per cent. She, as well as all the representatives, made use of the telephone as well as personal visits to obtain subscriptions. What is of most value is that each of the representatives, herself, is enthusiastic. About the Magazine. 'They have all had the advantage of having it in their own homes for many years, and therefore realize its value, and are able to sell it to others. Union Stake (Oregon) HE following comment on the Magazine campaign in Union 500 Stake is from Mildred S. Snider, stake secretary-treasurer: We first attribute our success with the Magazine to the very high quality of the Magazine itself, which makes it very desirable to our members; next, to the diligence and untiring efforts of our ward representatives. From reports from our wards we find which are up on their quota, keep a record of the Magazines, and contact each subscriber a month preceding the expiration date. One of our outstanding representatives gave a few minutes' talk each month at work-andbusiness meeting on the most interesting articles in the current Magazine. All these methods helped to reach the goal. Ellen S. Bean is stake Relief Society president and Della Rees is stake Magazine representative. Cassia Stake (Idaho) SOCIETY MAGATINE ANE R. HALE, Cassia Stake jue Magazine representative, writes: The success of thedrive was attained through the interest and efforts of the ward Magazine representatives, also the support and cooperation of Relief Society officers and members. A thorough house-to-house canvass was made in each ward, and with a determination to teach a high percentage, the representatives worked constantly at the drive. The Magazine was also featured in ward Relief Society conferences by a special number on the program. Annie M. Mercer is Relief Society president of this stake. Western States Mission LUCEAL R. CURTIS, mission Relief Society president, writes as follows of methods for promoting Magazine subscriptions, both those which proved successful in 1942 and those planned for the 1943 campaign: When it was so apparent that transportation would be limited, that all forms of activity would be greatly curtailed, that more and more families would, of necessity become stay-at-homes, we took definite THERMOMETER CHART USED IN 1942 MAGAZINE CAMPAIGN IN WESTERN STATES MISSION Branching from the central thermometer for the entire mission are thermometers of two paired mission districts, each with horizontal bars representative of its branch Relief Societies. Steps to follow the counsel given by the General Authorities, to place good reading material in the homes of the Latter-day Saints. We took as our slogan, "Every Relief Society member a Magazine subscriber and reader." To help us accomplish our project we employed the spirit of friendly competition and visual aids, as follows: NOTES FROM THE FIELD A large chart was prepared based on the thermometer idea, with a picture of a thermometer for each district and each Relief Society within each district in the Western States Mission. Each district was paired off to compete with a district of comparable size, and each Relief Society had a thermometer chart for the district to which it belonged as well as for the competing district. (The accompanying illustration shows the chart for one of these pairs of mission districts, with bars showing rates for each of the branches in these districts. The large chart for the entire mission was an extension of this diagram.) 'The progress made was marked up in red on the thermometer at the end of each two-week period, both on the master chart at the mission headquarters and on the individual charts. Frequent encouraging bulletins kept the mercury soaring. These charts were introduced at our annual Relief Society conferences in the various districts, and nearly all Magazine representatives were ready for the start on September 1. These charts were displayed prominently in the branch meeting places, with a list of the names of the women whose subscriptions had been entered. Husbands and children asked questions about the list and, as a result, many gift subscriptions were given to mothers, grandmothers, daughters, shut-ins, etc., in our mission. While we did not quite reach our goal of having 100 per cent of the Relief Society members subscribe for the Magazine, many branches went way over the 100 per cent mark and, as a result, 76 per cent of the Relief Society members in this mission are blessed with thein their homes. We were working for a record because of the increased spirituality in the homes of our Latter-day Saints as this excellent material is made available. For the 1943 campaign, we have an alarm clock chart of which a mimeographed copy, with movable hands, will be on display in every branch Relief Society. (See accompanying illustration.) The large hand will point to the mission percentage and the short hand to the branch percentage. The alarm will ring the first day of September for all Western States Magazine representatives to start for another year to place 501 ITS ALARMING BUT ITS TRUE ITS TIME TO RENEW OR BUY A NEWALARM CLOCK CHART FOR 1943 MAGAZINE CAMPAIGN IN WESTERN STATES MISSION Movable hands point to percentage of Magazine subscriptions in relation to membersthe short hand to the rate in the branch displaying the chart and the long hand to the rate for the entire mission. Choice literature in the homes of Relief Society members. We will try to gain the 100 per cent mark by midnight, November 30, 1943. We have set the date at November 30 so that we might get a complete report to the General Board by the last day of December. Weare sure that the fine groups of women in the Western States Mission, having tasted the benefits of last year's Magazine in their homes, will again respond to our Magazine goal. "Twice Blessed," a short skit used by the Western States Mission, in, connection with its 1942 Magazine campaign, is on file in the office of the General Board. Copies of this skit will be issued without charge to 502 Relief Societies requesting them. This skit demonstrates good methods of salesmanship and can be easily produced. Phoenix Stake (Arizona) MILDRED SMITHSON, Phoenix stake Magazine representative, reports: Ourcampaign was held during the months of October and November. Plans and preparations for this drive were discussed at a luncheon and meeting held in my home. Those present were the presidents and Magazine representatives of each ward, Stake Relief Society President Mable Mortensen, and her counselors. As our theme we used Leah D. Widtsoe's statement, "Theis always a good companion for me and when I read it faithfully I am always built up and feel that I can carry on, no matter what life may bring." We asked that each one carry this message to the members of the wards as they were visited. Sister Mortensen gave us a very inspiring and encouraging message. Each one present expressed her plans and intentions regarding her job. Many good ideas and suggestions were given to each other. At this meeting I became acquainted with the Magazine representatives for the first time. Since then, I have tried to keep in close touch with each one by telephone and visits. We took advantage of every opportunity to tell others about the Magazine and to encourage them to have it in their homes. I believe our success can be attributed to those sincere, steady, and energetic representatives who never overlooked an opportunity to renew a subscription or sell a new one. Bear Lake Stake (Idaho) AMY M. ATHAY, stake Relief Society president, and Gertrude R. Price, stake Magazine representative, jointly accounted for the success of the Magazine campaign in the Bear Lake Stake as follows: The good record of the Bear Lake Stake in putting over the Magazine drive for 1942 was largely the result of the achievements of the two previous years. For, when a ward has once gone "over the top," pride in so doing helps much in the next year's campaign. Since union meetings were discontinued, where the Magazine department was held, other ways have been worked out for communicating with the ward Magazine representatives, although we all miss the union meetings. Some of the factors which have helped much are: correspondence, call by telephone, and personal visits by the stake. Magazine representative; in some wards, a complete canvass of the ward by the ward Magazine representative with regular followup work, especially checking of the slips sent out at the time of expiration of the Magazine subscriptions; the helpful, encouraging support of Relief Society ward presidents, who often get several subscriptions themselves; the dependable, untiring, enthusiastic ward Magazine representatives, the alert checking, kindly assistance and support of the Relief Society stake president, Magazine representative, and other stake officers, have all been effective; the appreciation for fine reading in the Magazine, the enjoyment of the lessons, the true spirit of Relief Society work manifest by the majority of our sisters helped us reach our goal. Oakland Stake (California) "VWVE Buy OUR Magazine to READ." Ruth S. Hilton, president of Oakland Stake Relief Society writes that this is the new slogan for this stake's Magazine publicity work. She continues: Various members of our stake board have prepared splendid short talks on various articles, editorials, or bits of verse appearing in the current issues and then we've found occasions where these talks would be given before groups of women. We hope that by stimulating the actual study of our Magazine and treasuring many of its finest messages, we will have no need to say very much about the subscription list. This list should take care of itself if we all read and read intelligently each issue, COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE REPRESENTATIVES NTERESTING comments from stake and ward Magazine representatives were published in the May issue of the Magazine, pages 353 and 354, preceding the honor roll. Here are two additional statements: From Los Angeles Stake Jen Sasine, Magazine representative of Arlington Ward, the only ward in the stake which appears on the honor roll, wrote after receipt of the May issue of the Magazine: I'd like to express my appreciation for having won a place on the honor roll in the May Magazine. For the past three years I have worked in the Relief Society, and this year was my first as Magazine representative. I have enjoyed my work very much because it gave me the opportunity of knowing the sisters in the ward much better. From Cache Stake Lettie B. Rich, Magazine representative of Cache Stake, sent the following comment which _highlights the enthusiasm and determined effort of the several hundred local Magazine representatives in the stakes and English-speaking missions of the Church: One of my Magazine representatives called today for material. I asked her how she was getting along. She replied, "Fine, I have a good pair of legs and a bike so I'm going to put my time to good advantage." That surely is the spirit that will carry us through. GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS THE largest gift subscriptions received during 1942 for distribution at the discretion of the Magazine office to those in need of the Magazine came from wards of the South Los Angeles and Big Hom Stakes, as already mentioned along with the preceding reports from those stakes. We acknowledge here other generous gift subscriptions received from the Littlefield Ward of the Moapa Stake, Farmington Ward of the South Davis Stake, and North 20th Ward of the Ensign Stake. These gift subscriptions have been received with great appreciation by those to whom they were sent, principally missionaries and officers of new mission branch Relief Societies who may not have been able to subscribe immediately themselves.
