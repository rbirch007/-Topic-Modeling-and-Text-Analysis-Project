General Secretary-Treasurer Vera White Pohlman N 1921, when Thewas in its eighth year, the General Board was faced with the necessity of increasing the subscription price because of higher costs of printing during and after World War I. Relief Society women throughout the Church, eager to maintain the subscription price at one dollar per year, pledged themselves to increase the circulation so that the price need not be raised. They fulfilled this pledge and the price has been maintained at one dollar per year ever since. Furthermore, a steadily increasing circulation has made it possible to offer a bigger and better Magazine during the past few years, still at the dollar rate. Now, in its thirtieth year, the Magazine is again threatened with a higher subscription priceagain because of increased costs due to war conditions. And again the circulation must be greatly increased in order to avoid raising the subscription price. The General Board believes that Relief Society members, officers, and Magazine representatives will give every possible support to the Magazine in order that its present high quality may be maintained without increasing the subscription price, just as did the Relief Society women of nearly a quarter century ago. In order that the various stakes and missions may fully realize their present Magazine subscription rates and the great opportunity for extending the circulation, Magazine subscriptions in relation to Relief Society members are listed in the accompanying table and pictographs for all stakes and English-speaking missions of the Church which submitted the official annual Relief Society report to the General Board. The chart lists all stakes in alphabetical order, followed by the Englishspeaking missions. Opposite the name of each stake and mission is a row of 20 symbolssome dark and some lighteach representing 5 per cent of the Relief Society members in the stake or mission. The dark symbols represent the proportion of members who subscribed for the Magazine in 1942; the light symbols represent the proportion of members who did not subscribe for the Magazine IN 1942. The General Board has never required a specified quota of Magazine subscriptions from the various stakes, wards, and missions, but it has recognized, in the honor roll and by award subscriptions, those Societies whose subscriptions equalled or exceeded 75 per cent of their members. Accordingly, the charts show an achievement line at the 75 per cent point. From this line, stakes and missions may observe the extent to which their 1942 Magazine subscriptions approached or exceeded this point. If every stake and English-speaking Page 48] 482 mission whose subscription rate is less than 75 per cent of the membership will make an effort to increase subscriptions toward this point, it should be possible to keep the Magazine subscription price at one dollar per year. At the end of each row of symbols is a rank number by means of which the corresponding stake or mission may be found in the preceding table, listed in order according to percentage of Magazine subscriptions in relation to members. This table shows, as of 1942, the number of members, number of Magazine subscriptions, and the percentage of subscriptions to members. It also shows the number of subscriptions to be procured during the calendar year 1943 in order for the stake or mission to have a subscription rate equal to 75 per cent of its members, together with the approximate number of Latter-day Saint women in the stake or missionfrom all of whom Magazine subscriptions may be solicited. For example, for the 161 stakes and missions included in the table and chart, a total subscription list of 75,157 would be required to represent 75 per cent of the 100,320 members of Relief Society in these stakes and missions, but there are approximately 165,813 Latter-day Saint women in these same stakes and missions from whom to procure the 75,157 subscriptions. Similar computations may be made in the stakes and missions with respect to their local Relief Societies.
Attention is especially directed to the annual report in the June-July issue of the Magazine, to the table at the bottom of page 425 showing the extent to which Relief Society officers and class leaders subscribe for the Magazine. This table shows that nearly all (97 per cent) of stake officers and board members subscribe for the Magazine, that nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) of the executive officers in wards and branches are Magazine subscribers, and that 81 per cent of the class leaders take the Magazine. Figures are available in every stake, ward, and mission Relief Society annual report for 1942 from which local rates may be computed.
All subscriptions procured by the local Magazine representatives may be included in the count of subscriptions, whether or not the subscribers are members of Relief Society, and also those subscriptions procured within the boundaries of each local ward or branch which are mailed elsewhere, such as gift subscriptions.
It should be borne in mind that as the number of members increases or decreases during 1943, the subscription percentage will also fluctuate. For example, if a stake procures the number of subscriptions listed in the table as representing 75 per cent of the members, the subscription rate for this stake at the end of 1943 would be less than 75 per cent if the number of members has increased, or more than 75 per cent if the number of members has decreased. Magazine representatives should therefore check frequently with their Relief Society secretaries to ascertain the current membership count.
THE high-ranking stakes and missions which procured Magazine subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of their members for 1942 head the table. These are the Australian and the Western States Missions, and South Los Angeles, San Diego, Big Horn, San Francisco, Union, Cassia, Phoenix, and Bear Lake Stakes. These stakes and missions are also represented in the Notes from the Field of this issue where they tell of methods used in achieving these rates.
Of the total of 161 stakes and English-speaking missions listed in the table and charts, only these 10 report subscriptions equaling or exceeding 75 per cent of their members. It is especially noteworthy that the Australian Mission and the South Los Angeles Stake each procured subscriptions in excess of their membership. Also worthy of special mention are two districts of the Northern States MissionIllinois North and South with a percentage of 92, and Wisconsin with a percentage of 76, and the South Alabama district of the Southern States Mission with a percentage of 77. Mission districts are not listed separately in the table and chart because not all missions are organized into districts with respect to Relief Society work. These three high-rating mission districts were recognized, however, in the Magazine subscription honor roll in the May issue of the Magazine.
Each year, local Relief Societies, as well as stakes and missions, whose subscriptions to theequal or exceed 75 per cent of the Relief Society membership, are compiled into an honor roll and published in the Magazine. Each local Magazine representative achieving this goal is awarded a one-year gift subscription to the Magazine. This honor roll is based on the annual Magazine subscription reports submitted by local, stake, and mission Magazine representatives.
A total of 383 localrepresentatives achieved a place on the honor roll for 1942 and were awarded gift subscriptions, as shown on the honor roll in the Magazine for May 1943, supplemented by the June-July issue, page 412. But these 383 local Relief Societies (284 of them in stakes and 99 in missions), represented only 17 per cent of the total of 2,273 local Relief Societies throughout the Church. Only 8 or 6 per cent of the 144 stakes achieved a rating of 75 per cent, and only 2 of the missions. The missions, however, cannot all be compared in this respect, inasmuch as several of them are in non-English-speaking countries, and reports from some of the English-speaking missions in faraway places could not reach us under wartime shipping conditions.
Many of the local Relief Societies failed to submit subscription reports to their stake or mission officers, and the General Board received no compiled reports from 99 of the stakes nor from some of the missions from which reports could have reached the office. It is unfortunate that in some of these non-reporting stakes and missions there were local Magazine representatives who had achieved excellent Magazine subscription rates but whose records did not reach the General Board for inclusion in the honor roll either because the local Relief Society failed to submit its report or because the stake or mission failed to send in the compilation.

in the regular annual report. These figures should have been exactly the same as those submitted on the subscription reports fromrepresentatives, but these figures were in agreement in only about one-fourth of the stakes and missions. In all remaining stakes and missions either the count of members or count of subscriptions was in conflict in the two reports. This is surprising inasmuch as there was only one source of information for each figureMagazine representatives were instructed to procure the count of members as of December 1, 1942 from their respective Relief Society secretaries, and secretaries were instructed to procure the count of subscriptions from their respective Magazine representatives. The regular annual Relief Society report must necessarily be considered as the official report and therefore the figures as printed may not agree in all instances with figures submitted by Magazine representatives, including those printed in the honor roll. It is conceded that in many instances the number of subscriptions as reported by Magazine representatives may have been more accurate than the number shown by the secretary on the annual report, but without evidence to this effect the only alternative is to accept for this purpose the figures in the regular annual report. It is hoped that the recognition of this discrepancy will lead to more accurate reports for 1943.
Discrepancies of this sort account for inclusion in the honor roll of two stakes which on the basis of the annual report are not shown in the accompanying table and chart as having achieved a goal of 75 per cent or more.
