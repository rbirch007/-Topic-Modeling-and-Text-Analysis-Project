Magazine Promotion Work
Counselor Belle S. Spafford
THEis published monthly by the General Board for the spiritual, educational, and cultural advancement of Latter-day Saint women, and to further the work of Relief Society. In order for the Magazine to fulfill its purpose, three divisions of Magazine work must be well done:
First, the Magazine itself must be a publication of merit. Contents must be well selected and carefully edited; they must be interesting and profitable to Latter-day Saint women. The Magazine, from cover to cover, must be attractive to the eye, with every detail of such quality as to evoke the pride of publisher and Magazine representative alike; and subscribers should be able to readily recognize it as a high-class and valuable periodical. The publication of an attractive, worthwhile Magazine is made possible through the excellent contributions of gifted and authoritative writers, able artists, and a well-equipped Magazine staff.
Second, the Magazine must be extensively distributed among those for whom it is planned. No matter how splendid it may be, it is of little value unless circulatedand the wider its circulation, the greater is its value. A person will seldom make an effort to possess an article, irrespective of its worth, unless someone arouses his interest in it and points out that it has definite value to him as an individual. This is particularly true with regard to subscribing to a magazine. Someone must make the prospective subscriber

appreciate the value of the magazine in relation to his needs; then, a subscription will usually be forthcoming. This work of distribution is the special responsibility of stake and ward officers and Magazine representatives.
Third, the Magazine must not only be circulated, it must be read. Otherwise, it cannot fulfill the purpose for which it is published. Many people have the reading habit and read the Magazine thoroughly without any special stimulation; others read it because they feel a special need for certain information which it contains or for the recreation or entertainment which reading it provides; still others need to be frequently stimulated to read it, or they would seldom open its pages. It is safe to say that the average person reads that which is brought to his attention, and is exceedingly responsive to suggestions from those whose opinions he values. Relief Society officers, Magazine representatives, and Relief Society members may greatly stimulate Magazine reading by calling to the attention of the women, at every favorable opportunity, articles, stories, poems, etc., published in the various issues. Throughout the year, Magazine content should be kept before subscribers in an enthusiastic, converted way.
At this season of the year, the second important phase of Magazine work holds the special attention of many Relief Society officers and Magazine representatives. Although the time for the four-weeks intensive
MAGAZINE PROMOTION WORK
Magazine promotion work is optional, many stakes conduct this program during the fall months, September and October.
In planning this program, one question is uppermost: "How may we be successful in selling the Magazine?" Someone has said, "He who is mentally equipped with a thorough knowledge of the goods he sells and a study of human nature, who possesses an attractive personality, enjoys good health, is absolutely honest, and in love with his work, can hardly fail to make a successful salesman."
IN approaching her work, perhaps the first consideration of the Magazine representative is to determine who may be regarded as prospective subscribers. Theis not for Relief Society members alone, but is needed in the home of every Latter-day Saint woman. Every woman in the ward who is not already a subscriber should be regarded as a prospective subscriber. Prospective subscribers might profitably be classified; for example, the probable, the less probable, and the least probable. It has been estimated by successful sales organizations that the most hopeful group of prospects yields fifty times the results over the least hopeful group, in proportion to the time and energy expended.
It is recognized that certain advance information is valuable in selling; for example, the name, the size of the family, approximate ages of family members, the interests, ambitions, and needs of the family, their Church auxiliary affiliations, etc. The Magazine representative should also know the names of those who are

already subscribers and the expiration dates of their subscriptions; the names of those who have been but who are not now subscribers and, if possible, the reasons why their subscriptions were discontinued.
Successful Magazine representatives have a clear idea of Magazine content and a strong conviction of the worth of the periodical. "Know and value your merchandise" is a must in successful selling. The Magazine representative should be sufficiently familiar with Magazine content to be able to tell enough of any article, story, etc., to interest a prospective subscriber and to enable that person to see the value of the publication in relation to her individual interests and needs.
The wise Magazine representative gives careful consideration to how best to present the worth of the Magazine in a clear, intelligent, and appealing manner. The special ideas and incitements that might be used with each individual to arouse in her a desire to subscribe are thought through and evaluated. Generally speaking, it is more effective to stress the values to be derived from receiving the Magazine month after month than to merely enumerate, article by article and story by story, the content of one or two issues. It is usually profitable to briefly review one or two articles or stories which strike a point of interest, but to deal with every bit of content, article by article, is highly impractical.
In calling upon a woman in the interest of securing a Magazine subscription, the experienced representative always carries copies of one or two issues of the Magazine with herone of these a current issue. People

like to see what they are buying. Good judgment is used in getting a hearing. A time is selected for the interview that is convenient for the prospective subscriber and the visit is not extended too long. However, the representative endeavors not to appear rushed nor does she ever have a demanding attitude.
In selling it is advisable to appeal to the individual interests and needs of each woman solicited. Appeals that have been successfully used in selling Theare: (1) activity in Relief Society, (2) interest in homemaking, (3) desire for education, (4) desire to keep up with Church news and viewpoints, (5) desire to be familiar with movements, trends, and activities important to Latter-day Saint women, (6) ambitions for children, (7) need for high-class, entertaining reading matter. These are usually more effective appeals than just loyalty to Relief Society, although the loyalty appeal may be effective where others fail.
The appropriateness of the Magazine as a giftMother's Day, Christmas, birthday, etc.is an appeal which often results in a subscription.
Magazine representatives occasionally encounter objections to buying; such as, "I don't have time to read"; "I already subscribe for more magazines than I read"; "I can't afford to subscribe"; "I take the Era or The Children's Friend, and one Church magazine is enough," etc. The wise representative anticipates these objections and is fortified to dissolve them without argumentation; she has an answer ready that will casually set the objection at nought. A favorable comment of someone whose
opinion is respected, often removes such an objection. Frequently, the strongest objections are overcome by leaving a sample copy of the Magazine in the home.
Copies of some back issues are now available upon request at the office of the General Board, and representatives are urged to take advantage of this offer.
Business-like procedure is extremely important in selling. A receipt book, a good pencil or other needed supplies should always be at hand and necessary information should be accurately recorded. Thus the representative wins the confidence of the subscriber and avoids mistakes.
The spirit with whichrepresentatives approach their work has perhaps been responsible for more sales than any other one factor. They regard their work as an important Relief Society call, far-reaching in its influence. They take pleasure in showing the Magazine, striving always to make a friend for the periodical and for Relief Society even though they may not always make a sale. They recognize in their assignment a work of service, worthy of their time and best effort.
The following articles published in Thecontain helpful suggestions for selling. While some of these articles deal primarily with suggestions for stimulating the work through the union meeting, they contain enough help for ward representatives to justify a careful reading of them.
