President Rudger Clawson Elder George Albert Smith President of the Council of the Twelve HE following quotation is taken from Some Impressions of My Father by Samuel G. Clawson, son of President Rudger Clawson: "Life left no residue of bitterness in him; impression and memories left no scar. He never indulged in selfpity; never tolerated self-esteem. There was no elation when he won. He either won and turned victory into wisdom for the next encounter, else he endured and waited. He never lost because he saw time as part of endless eternity." Brother Clawson, who passed away Monday, June 21, 1943, presided over the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for eighteen years and has been a member of the Council for forty-five years. I have been privileged to be intimately associated with him for forty years. To know him was to love him. His kindly, gentle ways have endeared him to all who knew him. His quiet, thoughtful mien gave his co-workers confidence in him, his judgment, and purposes. He was a friend to everyone. His kindliness made him the confidant of the heartbroken and weary. He visited and cheered the sick, inspired and gave hope to the discouraged. Undeviating loyalty to the Presidency of the Church was an outstanding characteristic of the life of President Rudger Clawson. He was a consistent and industrious, hard-working executive. He presided with dignity over the Council of the Twelve Apostles making the stake and mission visiting appointmnts both for this. Quorum, the PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON First Council of Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. He was careful and considerate in his budgeting of assignments, endeavoring to divide the burdens equally. He took his full share of the work and utilized every ounce of his energy to take care of the responsibilities placed upon him as long as his strength permitted. All his public utterances were marked with toleration. His discourses were full of substance and deserving of careful study. A proverbial patience, a flawless faith, a fidelity to the truth coupled with a devotion to the Church and all that it stands for, have made achievements possible which will remain eternally to the credit of Rudger Clawson.
