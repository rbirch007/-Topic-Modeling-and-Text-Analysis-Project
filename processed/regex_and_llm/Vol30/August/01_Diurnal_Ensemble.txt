DIURNAL ENSEMBLE Celia A. Van Cott
DAWN
White aspens drip quicksilver dew below Each leaf-fringed bough where lupins nod and blow; From purple sage gray-mottled grouse arise On whirring wings into metallic skies.
The white swans lift from blue lagoons and wing Through platinum mists; gay purple martins swing Up greensward slopes and foaming white cascades, Atilting wings in daring escapades.
Across the dawn, pale pistillated green Lies fused in crescent waves of rosy sheen; Through pink-flanged clouds a scintillating ray Of golden light bursts through to pattern day.
DAY
A linnet trills his morning melody Beside a nest couched in a willow tree; The mother lifts her palpitating breast Where young stretch yellow mouths in hungry quest.
High noon lies hushed and still; no soothing breeze Stirs lagging leaves on dusty roadside trees; Birds seek relief from waves of heat that come Like molten metal from the copper sun.
The cattle browse upon the shadowed hill Through blue-eyed grass; wild pungent odors spill Their fragrance on the slowly cooling air And dusk descends like wordless lips at prayer.
DUSK
The soothing peace of dusk is shattered by The nightbird's scream and loon's wild shrieking cry. Through lily pads green speckled bullfrogs slide Into black lacquer from each marshbound side;
A heron skims across the lake, and flies To grass-lined nest: below gray charcoal skies. A twangy breeze sweeps down the sage-clad hill; A ripple laps the shore, then all is still.
Below a thin white moon gray storm clouds swing And darkness holds close every living thing; One paling amber star alone gives light For all the prowling creatures of the night.
No human hand can pattern life, or birth Of light, the heaven's pageantry, or earth; Nor can it mold one atomistic part Of mortal man or his emotive heart.
