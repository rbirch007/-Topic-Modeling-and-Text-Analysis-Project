Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon ERNARD SHAW has stated that woman's emancipation, with the growth of feminism, has not tended to discourage masculinity in men, but has tended to discourage boorishness, a trait of the weak who are trying to conceal their weakness. "THERE have always been men who believe that women like to be dominated by the "stronger sex." Ralph A. Habas, in the April issue of Facts, discusses this question thoughtfully in an article, "Do Women Want Domination?". He takes the negative viewpoint, and says that an attitude of voluntary cooperation should be the keynote of a happy marriage; neither dominance nor submissiveness, but a deep-seated regard for each other's personality. "THE magnitude of America's Red Cross movement may be gauged by activities in its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters, reported by Louis Markey in "Twenty-four Hours a Day," (Red Book, April 1943.) Most of the 43,000 workers are women, generally unpaid volunteers. In the Home Service Division, contacts are established, when necessary, between American families and their sons overseas (about 8,000 cases monthly). In the Blood Donors' Division, twenty cots are occupied nearly all the time. Stationary canteens are operated by 2,000 women. 'There are 1,000 nurses' aids, 200 Gray Ladies, 300 staff assistants, 500 stenographers and clerks, and 100 F. B. I. Assistants. In the Public Education Division, 250,000 women have taken courses in first aid, home nursing, nutrition, and diet. The workers deliver 5,500,000 surgical dressings monthly.

He was appointed by the First Presidency of the Church, in September 1919, "to audit the books of the General Board, examine the methods of accounting employed and to make recommendations regarding the bookkeeping and accounting as conditions might require." He thus became special advisor and supervisor of the business and financial affairs of the Board, which duty he faithfully and efficiently performed. This able and experienced accountant consolidated the accounts of the Board; set up a modern system of bookkeeping, and then for years supervised the operation of that system; with painstaking care he reviewed the accounts and regularly examined the receipts and disbursements; guarded the expenditures; and annually audited the books and at all times gave sound financial advice. He thus set up for Relief Society a safe and wise pattern of procedure which has been easy to follow. As a professional bookkeeper and auditor of long experience, President Clawson's contribution to the General Board has a value so great that it can hardly be measured. With painstaking care President Clawson also examined and became familiar with the Relief Society stake and ward record books, and with the Page 472 annual financial, statistical, and narrative reports sent in annually by these organizations to be audited and compiled by the General Secretary for presentation to the General Board and to the women of the whole organization. Few Relief Society women were more familiar with the inner workings of the organization, and no one was more proud of the systematic and painstaking efforts and accomplishments of stake and ward officers and workers in carrying on these practical affairs of the organization than was President Rug Clawson. Hardly a week in the year passed without a visit to Relief Society headquarters by this good and faithful man. Keenly did he sense his responsibility, and greatly interested was he in the affairs of the organization. 'This close association over a period of more than twenty years, together with his kindness, friendliness, courtesy, and good humor endeared him not only to the executive officers, but to every member of the staff. President Clawson was consulted regarding many of the varied problems of the Society as a whole, and his wise and fatherly counsel and advice were always very helpful. President Clawson was a living example of loyalty and devotion to the Church. No sacrifice was too great for him to make for the Gospel of the Master. He was a great defender of the faith. While he had EDITORIAL always a mild-appearing manner, yet for the right he was always aggressive. He always manifested that same courage which he exhibited when, as a young missionary in Georgia, he bravely faced the firing squad of that threatening and infuriated mob which had brutally taken the life of his missionary companion; and as he stood beside the dead 473 body of his associate and listened to the continued threats of the mob, he even bared his breast and told them to shoot. This surprising attitude on his part so startled the mob that they turned away, leaving him alone with the body of his friend and companion in the dense woods of GeorgiaAmy Brown Lyman.
