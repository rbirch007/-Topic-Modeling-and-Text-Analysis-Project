GRANDMA
Thelma Ireland
Grandma rocking on the porch, Hands folded in her lap. Her eyes are closed, could it be that She takes a noonday nap?
She doesn't sleep, but she does dream Of active years gone by When every minute of each day She worked. How time did fly!
There were a lot of rooms to clean And many mouths to feed, It took a lot of energy To tend to every need.
Now Grandma takes her "needed" rest  A rest she dreads each day, The time drags so, it makes her feel As though she were in the way.
No wonder Grandma sits and dreams Of busy yester years; It helps to pass the time away, It helps to dry her tears.
