Personal Letters Protest Picturizatoon of Smoking and Drinking THE following letter is an example of the excellent personal letters sent by Relief Society women to Mr. Will H. Hays of the nation's film industry, protesting the picturization of smoking and drinking. Such letters from individuals and Relief Societies were suggested by the General Board of Relief Society in The, page 45, as a follow up of the letter sent by the general presidencies and superintendencies of Church auxiliaries. Dear Mr. Hays: As a young mother and an American citizen interested in the welfare of our youth, I protest the great and unnecessary use of alcohol and tobacco in motion pictures. In addition to holding up before young people false standards and ideals, so much drinking and smoking by their heroes and heroines, I believe, represents the characters falsely. I refer specifically to such pictures as The Thin Man series wherein Nick Charles drinks incessantly, and continually puffs on a cigarette and yet always is up to solving the crime brilliantly. People I have known who drink and smoke to an extreme are not lovable individuals and are not worth two cents in an emergency. It is my sincere hope in writing you that action can be taken to eliminate an evil which has a far-reaching effect upon the lives of our young people. Yours very truly, (Signed) Mrs. Helen A. Perkes -JULY 1943
