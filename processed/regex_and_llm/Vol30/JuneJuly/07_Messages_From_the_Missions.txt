MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS
New Zealand Mission
ELVA T. COWLEY, president of Relief Societies in the New Zealand Mission, wrote as follows in a letter dated March 28, 1943:
"Since we started the welfare and beautification program in this mission, the response and results have been most gratifying. Many homes have been beautified and gardens planted. Nearly every home has its welfare cupboard and some of the Relief Societies have their Society cupboards.
"Non-members of the Church comment on the great improvement in the homes and yards of the Maoris and ask what has been the incentive behind such improvement. When told about our Church-wide plan they are very interested.
"Since this country became engaged in the war, many of our sisters have devoted their time and energy to doing patriotic work. This has weakened some of our branch organizations, especially in localities where families have moved into town to be near essential industries. However, large sums of money and materials have been turned over to the government through the efforts of our women.
"Letters of appreciation from the Red Cross have been received by some of our Societies for their generous contributions of knitted articles and made-over clothing. Also some of the sisters have contributed to and served in patriotic stores in the towns.
"Last March, throughout the mission, the various branches observed the centennial of the Relief Society. Every program was a credit to the sisters and the Church. Several of the banquets, with the many varieties of delicious food and beautifully decorated cakes, could not have been excelled by any organization.
"Memorial trees were planted throughout the mission with special ceremonies conducted. One touching incident was related to me by a sister whose branch postponed its tree planting for more favorable climatic conditions. She said she couldn't let the eventful day pass without planting a tree so she went to the bush and dug up a young tree and planted it in her own garden, and conducted a simple ceremony by herself."
Tahitian Mission
VENUS R. ROSSITER, president of Relief Societies in the Tahitian Mission, wrote the following interesting letter February 6, 1943:
"Our sisters are enjoying the lessons on the Articles of Faith very much, frequently expressing themselves to that effect.

"The handwork of the societies in the Tuamuto (or low coral reef) islands is chiefly shell work, while the societies in Tubuai weave very fine Panama hats and mats. At Papeete we have been crocheting, also weaving baskets and various types of hats and hat braids. We do not realize a great deal for our work, however, since the rate of exchange is so low (44 francs to the dollar). The sisters in all of the branches clean the meeting houses and care for the grounds surrounding them.
"It might be interesting to you to know a little about their shell work and hat weaving, both of which are long tedious procedures. First of all, many days are spent hunting for the shells on the sandy beaches or prying them loose from the rocks of the reefs. Then follow days of washing, cooking, and drying in the sun to clean and cure them, after which the shells are sorted as to type, size, and color. Then they are finally made up into portieres, handbags, collars, hatbands, belts, necklaces, bracelets, and simple strands, and brought to Papeete to sell to the exporters. Making hats, too, means a great deal more work than the weaving. First the leaves, barks, or palm fronds must be cut and carefully selected, then cooked until they are soft and pliable, bleached for days in the sun, and finally scraped and cut to the proper width and thickness before finally starting the weaving. When dyes can be procured, the lustrous bamboo barks are dyed in different colors. The hats are then finished by starching and blocking. When we were here twenty-five years ago practically all hats were the same style for young and old, but-JULY 1943
now the native women copy hats from most any picture they see.
"We have been very much isolated during the past year, having received mail from home only twice. But notwithstanding the isolation and the fact that President Rossiter and I are here alone in the mission, we are very happy and enjoying our work to the fullest."
Canadian Mission
EMILY J. SMITH, Relief Society president of the Canadian Mission reports:
"Every month one of the Relief Societies of the mission makes up a twenty-pound box of clothing, quilts, and many other useful and needed articles. This is then sent to the British Mission under a special license to import which has been granted them by the British Government. There the articles are distributed to members of the Church who are in need.
"The sisters in the Canadian Mission are giving splendid cooperation, and we all feel that the gratitude of our brethren and sisters in England is more than sufficient reward for our efforts."
New England Mission
BERTHA S. REEDER, Relief Society president of the New England Mission, and Elder Kenneth W. Porter, mission auxiliary supervisor, submitted the following report March 24, 1943:
"You may be interested to learn of some of the activities of the Relief Society of the New England Mission. Although nothing spectacular has been achieved, we feel that steady progress is being made in this very important line of work.
Relief Society Conference of the Zurich District, Switzerland
Held in 1942, with a number of visitors from Basel including (1) Anna Stoecklin, the acting Relief Society mission president; (2) Anna Baumann, first counselor from Zurich; Sister Schellenberg of Bern, the second counselor, was unable to be present on account of transportation problems. The gathering is known as the "Herbst Tagung" (Fall Conference). The photograph was recently received in Salt Lake City by Karl and Matilde Scheuermann Senhauser from their daughter, Hilde Senhauser Ringger of Zurich, Switzerland. For this picture Theis indebted to Elder Thomas E. McKay, one of the assistants to the Council of the Twelve and President of the European Missions.
"On March 14, throughout the mission, programs commemorating Anniversary Day were held in almost all branches. From St. John, Canada, to Bridgeport, Connecticut, our members, investigators, and friends met together to pay tribute to the Society that has done so much. The program suggestions printed in the January issue of the Magazine were quite generally followed, and those attending the various meetings had an enjoyable and profitable time. The following report is from one of our elders at St. John:
"'Last Sunday, March 14, the sisters presented a very fine program in sacrament meeting. They presented the entire program including the singing except for the sacramental hymn. It was outlined and supervised by Sister Cora Truswell. Each of the seven members of the Relief Society participated in one capacity or another. They were all dressed in white blouses and black skirts which added to the effectiveness.
"'A March 17th social was also prepared by the Relief Society, under the direction of Sister Mildred Lowe. The evening's entertainment consisted of an excellent program of several individual numbers, a short play followed by very good refreshments, and a group of games. Forty-four people, half of them non-members, were present on this occasion. The members of this Relief Society deserve a great deal of praise for the work they are doing and the fine

progress they are making in their many lines of work under the direction of President Jessie Frye.'
"Other programs worthy of special mention were held at Portland, Maine; Burlington, Vermont; Providence, Rhode Island; and other cities.
"The organization of new societies is being undertaken as soon as can wisely be done. Yesterday, March 24, a few ladies at Hyde Park, Massachusetts, were officially organized and grouped into a home Relief Society. Within a very short time, another home Relief Society will be effected, this one at Newport, Rhode Island. With the help of the missionaries (they are gradually becoming Relief Society conscious), we are attempting to see that as many women as possible are given the privilege of seeing and having the benefits of this work."
Spanish-American Mission
THE following excerpts are from a letter dated December 30, 1942, from Emma G. Haymore, former president of Relief Societies of the Spanish-American Mission who was succeeded in March 1943, by Ivie H. Jones:
"I marvel at the power of Relief Society in the mission field. While I admit I have reared my nine boys and girls on Relief Society, I had not realized how much women need this organization, and how much women need women to lead them. At Fresno, we put the Relief Society on a firmer foundation by calling and setting apart officers from among the local sisters. We wish to get our capable sisters working that they may be able to help themselves should our missionary force be reduced too much to reach them all.-JULY 1943
Then, too, they grow faster as they carry responsibility. You will enjoy reading the accomplishments of our Phoenix Relief Society in the following letter from Elders Christiansen and Mann:
"'This past Friday evening we held our "Cena Mexicana" which was considered quite a success in the true meaning of the word. Our Relief Society sisters donated the food and prepared a Mexican dinner for 215 which was considered one of the best the public had ever enjoyed. We had a most extraordinary program of Spanish dances, songs, religious songs in Spanish, and other special numbers. The people, including some of our best investigators, were really gratified with the fine evening's entertainment. The net proceeds of our program proved to be $100. We have been asked to give a similar program every two or three months. This plan has proved so successful that our Relief Society sisters have decided that they would like to use it as a project for raising money for the purpose of building a Spanish chapel in Phoenix after the war.'"
Hawaiian Mission
THE following excerpts are from letters of December 10, 1942 and March 25, 1943, from Inez Waldron, president of Relief Societies of the Hawaiian Mission:
"Enclosed are voluntary donations from the Hoolehua, Molokai Branch Relief Society toward the Relief Society centennial campanile. It was sent to me with the report that the members of that branch felt that they couldn't let the one-hundredth birthday year close without sending in a birthday gift to the General Board.
NOTES FROM THE FIELD

Ojai Branch Relief Society, California Mission, Organized May 28, 1943
The President, Marguerette Harris, is fourth from the left, first row standing. Fourth from left on the second row standing is Mignon Snyder, assistant district aid. In front are Elders Ward F. Jarman, and A. Woodrow Peterson, who submitted this picture.
"If you could only know these people you would understand why they felt this way. They are among the poorest people in the Church as far as temporal and worldly possessions are concerned, and yet they are among the richest, spiritually. They make very little money from their homestead lands, and that they give to the Church. They gather as one family in their chapel every week and worship in love and harmony. Twenty Relief Society women and ten Priesthood members came over to Honolulu by airplane, which is the only inter-island transportation now, for their annual excursion to the Temple. This is the tenth consecutive year that they have made this excursion during the Thanksgiving week, but the first time they have ever come by air. This was a great added expense, but they were able to make it because of their determination and the cooperation of the Saints who remained behind.
"This kind of spirit exists throughout the Hawaiian Mission. Several of the Relief Societies have discontinued, perhaps for the duration of the war, for all of the women are engaged seven days a week in various phases of the war effort. On the whole, however, the Societies of the mission are progressing very nicely. The sisters and missionaries report that they are thoroughly enjoying the project work that we have outlined for them this year. These include the canning and storing of fruits and vegetables in season, storing of blankets, making and storing of quilts, baby layettes, and other things which may become scarce here in case shipping is cut off. They are also reconditioning and storing all old clothing. There have been welfare committees organized in each branch and district to have charge of this work. The Relief Society is cooperating with the Priesthood also in helping on the welfare farms and in the Victory Gardens. They have learned the art of canning and storing fruits and vegetables from the women in the University of Hawaii Extension Service in each district.
"Every Society that was large enough, completed, by December 31, its quota of three quilts and the purchasing of five blankets, all of which were to be stored in the various district storehouses. By March 31, they will have completed three baby layettes in each branch. The remaining spring months are to be spent in reconditioning the clothing that has been gathered by the welfare committees in each district. Also, the sisters are going to make and outfit first-aid kits to be kept in the Relief Society rooms, and smaller individual ones for their automobiles. Throughout the summer months during lesson vacation they will can and preserve mangoes, pineapples, and papaias that are in such abundance during those months. Fortunately, the islands at present are well stocked with canning supplies and equipment.
"Many of our Relief Society sisters are giving fine service to the country at this time in holding responsible positions in the Red Cross and other war units in their communities. I'm sure that one of the contributing factors to their success and interest in these things is the splendid training along so many lines that they have received in the Relief Society and other organizations in our Church."
