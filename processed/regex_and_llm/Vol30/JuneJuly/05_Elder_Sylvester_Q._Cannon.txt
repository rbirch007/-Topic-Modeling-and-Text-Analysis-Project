Elder Sylvester Q. Cannon
Elder Joseph Fielding Smith Member of the Council of the Twelve
THE ancient Psalmist said most truly: "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
"For his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
"And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
I became acquainted with Elder Sylvester Q. Cannon in the days of our youth when we were students together, first in the Salt Lake Stake Academy, and then in the Latter-day Saints College which was the continuation of the former school. He was always sober-minded, thoughtful, and studious, giving attention to every detail of the lessons before him, a most excellent student. In all of his training the outstanding thing was his integrity and loyalty to the Church. Even in those early days his faith in the Gospel was manifest, and his willingness to give service for the Church and for his fellows was his keen delight.
In his early youth he filled his first mission and through his faithfulness, ability, and sober-mindedness was called to take the presidency of the mission where he labored. From that day until the time of his passing his time was faithfully given to serv-

ice in the Church. Besides serving in the mission field he served as a Stake president, then in the office of Presiding Bishop of the Church, and in his later years as a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. He was loved by all of his associates because of his faithfulness and his kindly spirit. He was calm and deliberate in his judgment, accurate in his deductions, and humble in every duty assigned to him. His passing on Saturday, May 20, 1943, is keenly felt by all of his associates and friends, but they have cause to rejoice in the purity of his life and his worthy example.
