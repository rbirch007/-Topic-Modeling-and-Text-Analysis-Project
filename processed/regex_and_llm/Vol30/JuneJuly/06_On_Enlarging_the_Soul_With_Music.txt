On Enlarging the Soul With Music
Elder Alexander Schreiner Salt Lake Tabernacle Organist
IF I were rich I would surround myself with the works of great men, the geniuses in literature, in music, and in art. I would pamper myself with books in bright bindings, with music in its richest splendor, and with paintings, architecture, and sculptures in their most exalted forms. I would marvel not only at the great works in nature, the brilliant sun and the mysterious stars in the firmament, creations of God, the Father of all, but I would wonder also, and feel humble, before the ennobling treasures of beauty which inspired sons of God, geniuses among men, have left for all mankind to enjoy. Through the eyes and ears of these rare composers of beauty, I would see and hear at this very moment some small inkling of the beauties of a heaven which is to come. I would have some real reason for feeling that the works of God are marvelous and beyond human understanding, because even the works of some of His earthly sons are of no small glory and magnificence.
No doubt many a great man has been at a loss to account for the source of inspiration which empowered him to accomplish wonderful things; and many, if they were God-fearing men, have fallen upon their knees in prayers of thanks to Divine Providence for their natural endowments enabling them to bring knowledge and beauty into the world through their scholarship, art, or other useful endeavors.

Among musicians, there were at least two men who expressed themselves in words as to the mysterious source of their creations. When Handel had finished writing his oratorio, The Messiah, in the feverish haste of twenty-four days, he thought that the angels of heaven must have whispered the music into his ears, because he felt he could not of himself alone have written music of such power and grandeur. Those of us whose souls vibrate with the strains of Handel's music can well sympathize with the feelings in the heart of this great composer.
Richard Wagner also felt that he was a privileged soul to be able to write masterpieces of supreme dramatic power. He, too, felt that he must have some unknown access to the harmonies of the spheres, because his works seemed to be of a greater stature, and of more splendor than of a mere man.
However, it is my personal feeling that men of genius have greater powers within themselves than they may realize. I believe that God largely allows His earth children to follow their own divinely inherited intelligence in the working out of their problems and the creation of the beauties of their environments. The fact that Handel and Wagner were able to produce heretofore unheard of beauties is merely evidence that mortal man is of the spiritual lineage of Divine royalty. In other words, a child of God inherits some of the great creative powers of the Creator
ON ENLARGING THE SOUL WITH MUSIC
Himself. The amazing genius of a human mind thus explains itself.
What a privilege it is to become acquainted with the creations of the masters. It strengthens the tie between man and God. The immortality of the fruits of great minds is one of the choicest blessings bestowed upon mankind.
Goethe, who was literally a fountain of genius, buried himself with the works of great minds, not only book literature and music literature, but paintings as well.
"If I were rich I would surround myself with the works of great men." We are living in an era when this statement may be changed to read as follows: "Though I am poor, I can surround myself with the works of great men." Present-day advertising has made material goods so attractive that there has been a tendency to crowd out the enjoyment of the creations of great souls, the cherished treasures of all time. At this moment we are facing new circumstances. With world war devouring economic wealth, it would seem wise for us to seek the acquisition of non-material riches and beauties which cannot be taken away from us.
POOR people today can own a larger library of books than did wealthy readers of a century or more ago. What about music? Here we come to an entirely new development in our civilization, something rather startling and wonderful to experience. The modern phonograph with its recorded treasures offers an acquaintanceship with the symphonies of the greatest music creators of every period, performed by the skilled music interpreters of our day, and
381
brought into our homes by one of the miracles of modern science. The phonograph is a tri-combination of phenomenal magnitude. Two centuries ago the royalty of Europe entertained itself with an abundance of good music. Prominent musicians of that day were engaged to perform, to compose, and to direct court orchestras, because music was as much a part of the daily routine as was the evening repast that preceded it. Crowned heads were as proud of the music offered in their courts as they were of any of their tangible possessions. 'This demand for music was a great stimulus to the musicians of that day and resulted in a flowering of the art of composition. It fanned the creative genius of Bach and Handel, of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. 'These men brought the art of music to a climax under the lavish patronage of European court life. 'This splendid heritage is no longer the exclusive property of an aristocracy, for it ls now conveniently available to anyone who cares to. Accept it. With the whole world in a most trying condition, music is like the north star, something we can trust and have faith in, something which has dropped to us as out of the blue of heaven to console and delight our hearts. But the reader may object that he is not inclined toward music which is of the grand manner. I believe with Shakespeare that every good child of God really has music in him, though it may not have been awakened. Several years ago a friend of mine was persuaded to attend his first symphony concert. He was not greatly interested, but a spark in him 382 was aroused so that today he is one of the most ardent enthusiasts on music that I know. He has discovered that real music is not composed of trivial tunes, but is something of genuine grandeur. Music has opened a new avenue of joy in his life. The phrase "get acquainted with music, you might like it" is an experiment that is almost certain to have a happy ending. We enjoy things and people and places that we know. The more we expand our interests, the more fully we partake of the God-given treasures that are a part of the design of our personal destiny and fulfillment. The first step in the understanding of music is exposure to it. We must hear it, we must become acquainted with it, we must learn to recognize it, then we will admire it, appreciate it, love it. The phonograph offers a most convenient and sure method for carrying out this formula. It makes possible frequent repetitions that will lead to the same familiarity with the classics that exists with the folk songs and popular melodies of childhood. We all love the tunes that are sung in community gatherings, the lullabys, the Christmas-JULY 1943 carols, the negro melodies. When we become equally well acquainted with the works of the masters of music, our ceiling of appreciation will rise and expand to heights that bring undreamed of joy. The Apostle Paul said, "When I was a child, I spake as a child." Adults who have neglected the beauties of music literature are as children musically. Aristotle uttered a wise recommendation when he said, "Let the young pursue their studies. In music until they are able to feel delight in noble melodies and thythms, and not merely in that common part of music in which every slave or child and even some animals find pleasure." After more than two thousand years, Aristotle's advice is still pertinent. If we seek after the ways of strong men, we partake of their virtues and nobleness. May music, the universal language, open up a new chapter of joy in our lives. Families who in former years were avid collectors of sets of books are now collecting albums of recorded music. Great music has quite as much aesthetic significance as volumes of "belles-lettres." Suggested List of Recordings for Beginners 1. Dvorak: New World Symphony 2.

Gardiner HE recent appointment of Agnes McMillan Bolto to the General Board brings to this group a member well qualified to fill her new assignment. Many years of continuous activity and service in the Relief Society of the Church have broadened the scope of her endeavors and endeared her to the people among whom she has served. Her life and character reflect her Scotch-English parentage. Her father, William McMillan, was of Scotch extraction, although he was born in England of Latter-day Saint parentage. Faith in God and His people inspired the McMillans to come to Utah. They made their home in the Twenty-second Ward of Salt Lake City and when the Twenty-second Ward was divided and the Twentyeighth Ward created, Brother McMillan became the first bishop of the Twenty-eighth Ward, presiding over it for twenty-three years. His wise counsel endeared him to his people and was a source of inspiration and guidance to his children. He was politically active and served three terms in the state legislature, holding positions of importance and authority for many years. Sister Bolto's mother, the daughter of Benjamin Smith Newton, of Newcastle, England, was a homemaker, presiding with dignity and justice in the affairs of home life. She was a devoted wife and mother, sustaining her husband in his public duties. She gave diligent and faithful AGNES M. BOLTO service in the Relief Society, particularly in welfare work. She was known and loved for acts of kindness among the sick and needy, serving for days at a time during epidemics. Agnes McMillan Bolto, the fourth child, was born in Salt Lake City, September 27th, 1887. Her early training in a home influenced strongly by religious precept and example, has greatly augmented her naturally spiritual temperament. Her activity in the Church began at the age of fourteen, as secretary of the ward Primary. When only seventeen, she was set apart as an ordinance worker in the Salt Lake Temple, acting in this capacity for ten years. Page 383 384 She was a member of the Tabernacle choir, under both Evan Stephens and Anthony C. Lund, contributing freely of her musical talent in solo work as well as group singing. Professor Stephens accorded her the distinction of being the foremost contralto in Utah. She accompanied the choir on its northwest tour in 1909, and later, with her husband, George F'. Bolto, went with the choir to New York. Being called to sing in the Temple choir by Prof. J. C. Thomas, she was often selected to sing duets with President Heber J. Grant. Those were happy years, endowing her richly with spirituality and contributing to her training. She was united in marriage to George F. Bolto in 1910, and they made their home in the Third Ward in Salt Lake City, where Sister Bolto faithfully participated in ward activities. She presided over the Junior Sunday School, was president of the Primary Association for three years, and was assistant choir leader. During this time she also organized, under the presidency of Lotta Paul Baxter, the first Relief Society chorus in Liberty Stake. In 1917, the Boltos moved to Richards Ward, Granite Stake, in Salt Lake City, where she continued to participate actively in Church work, serving first as secretary of the Relief Society and later as stake chorister, under Sister Leonora T. Harrington. She attended the first course in family welfare work conducted by the General Board at the Brigham Young University in 1920 under the leadership of Amy Brown Lyman. Later she served for six months as a field worker of the social]-JULY 1943 welfare department of the Relief Society General Board. Sister Bolto was later called to the Granite Stake Relief Society Board, where she served as second and, subsequently, as first counselor to Sister Emmaretta G. Brown, giving untiring and valuable service for about eight years, when home duties claimed her entire attention. After a short respite she was again called to active service outside her home, being elected president of the Forest School Parent-Teacher Association. Her work here was of pronounced value to the school and the community. During this time she was also chorister of the ward Relief Society. Sister Bolto was appointed second counselor to Myrtle B. Latimer in the Ganite Stake Relief Society, and in 1938 succeeded her as president, which position she held at the time of her call to the General Board. The home life of Brother and Sister Bolto was ideal. Brother Bolto died January 25, 1943. Their two children, Milan and Frances, arenow married; Milan is in the military service of his country. Agnes Bolto's appointment to the Relief Society General Board, May 5, 1943, brings to this Board a woman of dignity and poise, endowed with spirituality, with a loyal trust in the Priesthood and its salutary influence on the lives of the women of the Church. Wise in the choice of friends and associates, she has presided with dignity, justice, and understanding, and approaches her new position with humility and trust in the Lord. Steps in the Development of Our Flag The first flag of the United States, known as the Cambridge flag, was raised by George Washington at Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 2, 1776. The union was the combined crosses of St. George and St. Andrew. In August 1777, this flag was raised by Captain Abraham Swarthwout at Fort Schuyler. President Washington approved, January 13, 1794, this flag consisting of fifteen stars and stripes, Vermont and Kentucky having been admitted to the Union. In 1818, Congress enacted that the thirteen stripes, denoting the thirteen original colonies, be restored, and a star added to the blue canton for each state after its admission to the Union. The present flag consists of thirteen stripes with a blue canton bearing fortyeight stars, one for each state in the Union. Page 385 The Story of Old Glory Mabel Harmer ECAUSE it is the symbol of home, country, liberty, and all else that we hold most dear, "Old. Glory" commands our sincerest reverence, claims our deepest love, and inspires our greatest acts of courage. Nations have unfurled their flags since the beginnings of recorded history, and legions have followed their ensigns to greater deeds of courage and valor. "Terrible as an army with banners," said King Solomon over three thousand years ago. The Star-spangled Banner has a diversified and fascinating history and it is particularly fitting at this time, when the flag is so prominent in our national spotlight, that we learn more of its history. Many flags, both of this and other nations, flew over this land before the stars and stripes, as we know it today, was finally adopted. Columbus unfurled the colorful banner of Spain when he landed on the island of San Salvador in 1492. The orange, white, and blue flag of the Dutch Republic flew over the colony of New Netherland for fifty years, until an English fleet replaced it in 1664 with the cross of St. George and gave the colony the name of New York. In 1535, Jacques Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence and formally claimed its entire valley in the name of the King of France. When James of Scotland succeeded Queen Elizabeth on the English throne, he created the Union flag by - uniting the red cross of St. George on its field of white with the white cross of Scotland's St. Andrew on Page 386 its field of blue, and it was this flag that waved over the struggling colonies of Jamestown and Plymouth. Not only was it the first flag to fly over the homes of English-speaking people in America, but its colors of red, white, and blue lived on to become the permanent colors of the flag of the United States. It was the Union flag that led Washington's struggling army of Virginians to battle at Fort Necessity in 1754, it waved above the successful colonists in the defeat of Braddock, and it replaced the flag of France at Detroit in 1760. Although the Union flag was the chief standard of the American colonists for a great many years, they soon began to create individual flags expressive of their particular localities and interests. Among the best known of these was the pine tree flag of Massachusetts, which towards the close of the colonial period became known as the "Liberty Tree" and bore the legend "An Appeal to Heaven." Another symbol which was employed in a variety of design in New England was the rattlesnake flag with the warning words, "Don't Tread On Me." New York fashioned a flag with a black beaver on a white background, and Rhode Island's white flag had the word "Hope" above a blue anchor. There was no common standard furled over the heads of the fighting colonists when the fires of the Revolutionary War flared into full blaze. As one historian says, "The only common flag the Colonists had was the one they were fighting against," THE STORY OF OLD GLORY but among the many banners that floated over the various companies were a number that could easily have been forerunners in design for our present stars and stripes. Among these was the flag of the Philadelphia Light Horse Troop which escorted General Washington to New York to assume command of the army and which bore in its center a knot tied with thirteen cords flanked by thirteen blue and silver stripes. The first flag to be generally adopted by the united colonists was known as the Grand Union flag and was flown from a seventy-six-foot flagstaff on Prospect Hill in Somerville, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1776. It is not known who designed the flag but, oddly enough, it contained the Union Jack of the mother country in the canton together with the thirteen red and white stripes still used in our national banner. It continued in use until nearly a year after the signing of the Declaration of Independence when it was superseded by the stars and stripes. ITH the signing of the Declaration of Independence, all allegiance to Britain was broken and the symbolic crosses of the Grand Union flag became obsolete. Nevertheless, Congress was painstakingly slow in proceeding to create a new flag. It was not until June 14, 1777 that Congress, convened at Philadelphia, in the midst of numerous items of petty business passed the simple resolution, ".... That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.". Thus without fanfare 387 or ostentation the stars and stripes was born. Just as the Great Union flag had been created by the simple procedure of adding six white stripes to the field of England's flag, the new national banner was made by substituting the thirteen white stars on a field of blue for the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew. In this manner the union of the thirteen colonies was doubly portrayed, both by the stars and the stripes. 'There was no definite design provided at this time, and the matter of what proportions the field should be, or how the stars should be arranged was left entirely up to the fancy of the seamstresses who fashioned the various flags. Dr. M. M. Quaife in his book The Flag of the United States says, "We seek in vain for any recorded explanation of this cavalier procedure but it seems obvious that the reverence which all Americans today pay to their flag was foreign to the minds of the men of 1777. A flag was essential to the conduct of warfare between ships at sea, and the Congress met the need by prescribing in general terms the new design. It is obvious that their actions were animated by the practical need and but slightly, if at all, by sentiment for the new banner; nor need we wonder at this, for in the beginning it was not hallowed by the associations and the sacrifices of more than a century and a half which all present-day Americans instinctively associate with it." Congress in adopting the emblem had assumed that there would be only thirteen permanent states. Rapid expansion to the west and south soon brought about a national change 388 of mind in this regard, however, and in 1781 Congress adopted a resolution pledging that new states would be admitted to the Union enjoying equal privileges with the original ones. Vermont and Kentucky were already well settled and when they became the 14th and isth states of the Union, it was soon apparent that something had to be done about the flag. In 1793 a resolution was presented to Congress suggesting that the flag be changed to contain fifteen stars and fifteen stripes and the Senate nonchalantly passed the bill; but the House arose in indignant debate and one member "thought it a trifling business which ought not to engross the attention of the House when it was their duty to discuss matters of infinitely greater importance." He said, "If we are to alter the flag from thirteen to fifteen stripes with two additionel stars because Vermont and Kentucky have been added, we may go on add-. Ing and altering at this rate for one. Hundred years to come. It is likely that before fifteen years shall elapse we Shall consist of 20 states. The flag ought to be permanent." After considerable _ bickering wherein the members of the House freely expressed themselves that the bill was not worth all the trouble and waste of time it was causing, they passed the bill, in order to get rid of it; and thus the second flag of the United States became one of fifteen ted and white stripes. - It was our national banner for nearly a quarter of a century, led our soldiers through three wars, and flew over Fort McHenry on the night of September 13-14, 1814 when Francis Scott Key-JULY 1943 watched through the rockets' red glare to learn the fate of the Starspangled Banner. This lack of regard for or even interest in the flag can be understood when it is remembered that as yet we were not a strong nation bound by ties of loyalty and tradition. We were but a group of struggling and loosely-bound states far more concerned about individual governments than about the nation as a whole. In the same manner our national anthem attracted but little interest when it first appeared in print, and it was not until the time of the Civil War that it began to attain its present place in the affection of the American people. After the war of 1812 there was a considerable improvement in the unity of feeling existing between the states and a tremendous upsurge in our sense of national pride. By 1816 there were five additional states in the Union but no provisions had been made for displaying this increase in the commonwealth upon the flag. The matter was brought up in Congress by Peter H. Wendover and it was largely due to his persistent efforts, over a period of two years, that a permanent design for the flag was finally adopted. Members of Congress argued that it was impractical to add additional | stripes for each new state and that the number should be reverted back to the original thirteen stars and stripes. As everyone knows, a compromise was finally effected, in 1818, whereby the number of stripes was placed at thirteen for the original colonies while a new star was added for each new state until forty-eight (Continued on page 392) Short-story Writing Pearl Spencer Department of English, Logan Senior High School WHEN is a short story not a short story, but a sketch, a tale, or an incident? 'This is the question which many an aspiring author ruefully asks herself as her lovingly-wrought manuscript comes back with a kindly note praising the spirit, perhaps the style, but pointing out that it doesn't quite qualify as a short story. The question is particularly difficult to answer in view of the fact that many modern writers, inspired by Chekhov and moved by an increasing interest in social conditions rather than the individual, have written memorable stories which have certainly not followed the rules laid down by Poe, and which seem to some readers not to be short stories at all. But re-examination of the great pieces of short fiction in the modern manner will show that they possess the central purpose and discernment that provide the one essential feature of the short story  unity. Assuming unity to be the necessary element of the short story, it can be seen that the followers of the Russian writers are not so much at variance with Poe's standards as many readers have thought. The difference, after all, seems chiefly one of technique, not of intent. For Poe's great purpose, you will remember, was to create a single, strong, emotional expression on his readers. He laid down the rules by which, it seemed to him, such an impression might best be made. If other methods can do the same, he would probably be the last to object. He would also agree that too many of his followers had become mechanics rather than artists, and that new ways of writing might give new life to the craft. Just as these literary mechanics, turning out vast numbers of short stories with "interchangeable parts," as one critic phrased it, discredited Poe's formula among some writers, so it is the second-rate writers, without genuine purpose or literary discipline, who have given the modern short story the reputation of being formless. As a result, many of us have the idea that we may describe our eccentric neighbor's vagaries or the desolate family camped beside the highway, and call the result a short story. The essential unity of the short story is achieved by the selection of _a struggle in which the characters of the story are engaged, and in picturing or predicting the outcome of this struggle. The struggle may be man (or woman) against the perils of intrigue, the elements, war, or enemies  and we have the adventure story; against his rivals the love story; against his material handicaps the success story; his weaknesses the moral story; the universe the religious story; his personality the psychological story; his environment  the story of social consciousness. This last, especially, has widely extended Page 389 390 the conception of what constitutes a dramatic struggle. Whatever the theme and method a writer chooses, it is his treatment of this struggle that determines the unity of his story. Its significance must be shown. It must be followed to an inevitable, clear-eyed conclusion. Accident and coincidence may hasten or precipitate the conclusion, we are told, but they must not determine it. That must be inherent in the characters and circumstances. And it is well to remember that it is not the unique situation or the dramatic denouement that brings a readerback to certain stories time and time again. It is the way in which the struggle unfolds that makes some stories immortal; that magic by which they still keep us tingling with suspense even after we know them almost by heart. This matter of resolving the conflict and getting everything ended neatly and satisfactorily is not so difficult if one chooses a struggle where the outcome is a matter of a lifetime of happiness or unhappiness, and the issues are clearly defined and capable of solution. Writing then becomes chiefly a matter of working tremendously hard to carry the reader along, in rapt attention, toward the end of the struggle, the solution of the plot. But what of the minor dramas that the sensitive participants in life see about them every day? What of those struggles whose very poignancy lies in their being unending? What of the heroism that is all the greater for being unheralded and unsung? What of those daily choices we make, no one of which is in itself of decisive importance, but which-JULY 1943 add up inevitably to our destinies? Are these not the stuff of literature also? They are indeed, and they are a rich source of material for the beginning writer, not only because we can interpret best the things we know and love, but for the very practical reason that there is a great interest in such material at the present time. If the interest is waning, as it may be, the only ones to blame are the writers who have surfeited us with formless uninterpreted, usually gloomy sketches in the name of the "new" short story. For, first of all, such material must be given form. If the nature of a man's life is to be revealed, and his never-ending, but brave struggle with poverty is to be shown, then certain incidents, complete in themselves, must be carefully chosen and highlighted. Second, the significance of these events must be made clear. It has been pointed out that the writer of a short story can't develop his characters as completely as a novelist does, but that he has to know them just as well in order to reveal them by lightning flashes, as it were. Too many writers of the "slice of life' school don't know their characters any better than any casual observer might, and reveal no more of the significance of their lives. Somerset Maugham warns us that whenever a story has no more significance than a recital of facts, the danger point has been reached. Third, the occurrences which one chooses must illumine the past and predict the future inexorably. This requirement is imposed upon the writer of this kind of story even more sternly than upon the author who SHORT-STORY WRITING creates'a more formal plot within whose outline the story has its being. The choice of incident must, in a brief space, add up in effect to a lifetime. Read Dorothy Parker's "Clothe the Naked" as an example of this kind of story. The writer of the story which does not rely upon a decisive climax and outcome, usually imposes a fourth obligation upon himself. Very often such a story becomes compelling only as it is felt to be somehow typical of large numbers of the same sort of people. Much of the reader's pleasure comes from his sense of recognition. Every writer, as Miss Edith Ronald Mirrielees points out, needs the capacity for "making the story's figures stand clear as individuals and yet cast shadows larger than the individual." 'This capacity is particularly essential in the story whose characters interest and appeal because they are typical rather than individual. PROBABLY nothing could do the cause of the pioneer story* more good than for numerous writers to turn with determination to strongly plotted stories with gripping situations, authentic personal struggles, and dramatic, triumphant climaxes. Such stories would be fit vehicles to reveal the noble, dignified, yet intensely human pioneer men and women (particularly the women), who so seldom have been adequately dealt with in the short story. Weare not obligated to show the epic significance of the entire pioneer 391 trek everytime we write of pioneer life as so many have seemed to feel. But we are obligated, whenever we write a short story of pioneer days, to produce a firm narrative with an honestly defined struggle. It should be a story that will stand on its own feet and create a response in the reader, rather than depending upon his already established responses to make it effective. 'This rather lazy dependence upon the sympathetic attitude of the reader has made too many of our pioneer stories lack appeal for "outsiders" or our own members to whom the sight of a handcart, for example, does not bring the strong emotional response that it does in most of us. No greater service could be done our young people than to provide them with stirring, genuinely moving fiction which would help create an understanding attitude toward the pioneers. Instead, much of our fiction assumes that such an admiring, understanding, and reverent attitude already exists, and the symbols of pioneer life the handcart, the _ trail-side grave will in themselves give a story emotional power. They are genuinely meaningful symbols, and our grandfathers' diaries are full of enough characters and situations, color and meaning, to provide grist for our mills for as long as Daniel Boone has done, but it's our task to give them new form, new life, and new meaning for a new generation. Because such a wealth of source material on pioneer days exists, many people have assumed that pioneer *Special instruction is given in this article on the writing of pioneer stories because a need is recognized for direction in this type of short-story writing. The General Board does not, in any way, desire to encourage the writing of pioneer stories more than other types of fiction. 392 stories should be easy to write. Writers know that they are not. A satisfactory, clearly defined struggle is hard to set up in a pioneer story, save in matters of hardships and privation; for the united struggle of the pioneers against their common protagonists always seems more characteristic than their individual struggles and problems. It is hard not to blur the unity with too much explanation. It is difficult not to intrude a moral instead of letting the characters convey their own message. We are not allowed the same range in satisfactory endings; therefore we must often work much harder to create suspense and charm in the way in which the story progresses to its conclusion. Because we are truly 'a peculiar people," we are even more false in our premises than most historical writers if we assume the plausible untruth that "people have always been the same" and interpret the pioneer sense of values accordingly. The premises upon which their sense of values were built are difficult to explain and difficult-JULY 1943 to take for granted as motivations. We have to be especially careful, as we try to appeal to the present generation, not to lose contact with the real spirit and real thinking of the pioneers. 'This requires constant, intimate, understanding contact with original source material. How impossible it is to interpret the pioneers without having imbibed deeply of their spirit and convictions is illustrated by the many scholarly and factually accurate studies which are still entirely false and valueless as interpretations of their lives. For any story of plot, Poe's formula is still the best in the world, and every writer, of course, knows his analysis by heart. Certainly no one can safely diverge from it until his sense of form is sure. Somerset Maugham sums Poe up thus: "It [the short story] is a piece of fiction, dealing with a single incident, material or spiritual, that can be read at a sitting; it is original, it must sparkle, excite, or impress, and it must have unity of effect or impression. It should move in an even line from its exposition to its close." THE STORY OF OLD GLORY (Continued from page 388) in all blazed forth upon the blue field. In December 1942 by Act of Congress, a slight change was made in the manner of presenting the pledge to the flag. In place of extending the arm, as formerly, the hand now remains over the heart during the entire time that the pledge is repeated, and is not dropped until after the final word "all."

FAT SALVAGE PROGRAM RESULTS to date of the Fat Salvage program to obtain glycerine for wartime purposes. Confirm that the methods originally set up were sound and that the plan has been functioning on an effective basis. The present problem is one of impressing a larger percentage of American housewives with the importance of saving and turning in their waste household fats and greases. A consumer study made by the Office of War Information in January 1943, shows that while 92 per cent of housewives are familiar with the program and 74 per cent understand the procedures, to be followed, only 59 per cent were saving kitchen fats and only 31 per cent had actually turned them into their meat dealers. Are you one of the 31 per cent? Save Waste Fats Rush them to your meat dealer. ANNUAL RELIEF SOCIETY SHORT-STORY CONTEST 395 Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon MOST of the world's inhabitants hate war. Man's cupidity causes it. Man's stupidity permits it. All suffer its tragic consequences. Fortunately, however, some good comes of war. Like a refiner's fire, frequently it burns out the dross of human selfishness, leaving gold ingots of devotion, nobility, heroism. A task worthy of every woman's consecration is to carry into the post-war world virtues learned through today's vicissitudes, such as: the joy of having children (last year's birthrate in America doubled that of 1941, and this year's will be higher); the value of marriage and a home (half the girls in one war production plant admit they are hoping and saving for a home); the steadying power of physical work; the experiences of budgeting; the gratifications of practicing thrift; and the immense economy of cooperation, in home, community, national, and international life. War teaches us the comfort of faith in God; the necessity of human brotherhood; the fact that suffering can make us a little more God-like in comprehension. These are lessons to remember.

EDITORIAL VOL. 30 JUNE-JULY 1943 NOS. 6 and 7 To Our "Father! to God Himself we cannot give a holier name."  Wordsworth TWO of the most hallowed words in any language are "father" and "mother," and around these names are associated memories among the most precious of this life. Of late years it has become customary to pay special honor to our mothers on the second Sunday in May, and to our fathers on the third Sunday in June. Happy the child, the youth, and the man or woman to whom the word "father" recalls a series of recollections brimming with the loving care and kindness bestowed upon him by his father. To such a person, memory reaches back to earliest years and treasured childhood experiences. These will vary, but how often, perchance, will one of these incidents be centered about the bedside of the sick, as the family kneels in prayer and the father, exercising one of his greatest prerogatives as the bearer of the Holy Priesthood, invokes the healing power upon the sick. Mingled with such important and sacred memories will be ones of a lighter nature, ones in which the father figures as a veritable mine crammed full of pennies and nickels, a haven of last resort in crucial times of need. A trip taken with a father always remains a bright and cherished mem-  W ordsworth. Ory. It may have been to a large city where it seemed that all the alluring and enchanting sights and sounds in the world were spread out before one's wondering gaze. One such trip to New York is recalled. Each morning one was awakened by father standing in the doorway of the hotel bedroom and quoting, "The bird of time has but a little way to fly and lo, the bird is on the wing." This reminder of the fast fleeting magic days worked as a charm! Associated with that special trip are recollections of a visit to the lower east side in order that a wholesome home might the better be appreciated; the wonders of the Hippodrome where the horses disappeared under the water; the magic of the Automat where one put in a nickel and food appeared in as wonderful a manner as any fairy tale; luncheon at the Astor with Hazel Dawn; and two trips to the Metropolitan to watch with fascinated eyes the dancing of Nijinski and the Russian Ballet. Golden pages from the book of memory of a father's kindness and generosity! Another happy recollection of a holiday spent with father is of a mountain camping trip which remains a vivid picture for two reasons: first, for the discovery that father was a good cook; and second, a not-so-pleasant Poge 397 remembrance of flesh gained from eating his skillet-bread. As one grows older, one more and more becomes conscious of the watchful and constant care evidenced by a father as the guardian of his children. Pitfalls and dangers are pointed out and all one's friends and associates are closely scrutinized. One feels at times that his premonitions and insight are too acute to be comfortable, but gradually as one's outlook broadens, his wisdom is recognized and his advice is followed with a better grace. His justice and fairness stand out as prominent traits, and his encouragement and understanding are ever sources of strength. One comes to turn to him more and more for counsel and in following it, one's life takes on a righteous pattern. After marriage, when one's husband becomes the father of one's children, then the cycle is completed. In noting the tender, constant, and great love manifested by a young father toward his babies and young children, one's appreciation for fatherhood is increased, and thanksgiving to the Lord wells up in one's heart for fathers such as these fathers who will be our fathers not only here but throughout time and all eternity as well. M. C. S. Personal Letters Protest Picturizatoon of Smoking and Drinking THE following letter is an example of the excellent personal letters sent by Relief Society women to Mr. Will H. Hays of the nation's film industry, protesting the picturization of smoking and drinking. Such letters from individuals and Relief Societies were suggested by the General Board of Relief Society in The, page 45, as a follow up of the letter sent by the general presidencies and superintendencies of Church auxiliaries. Dear Mr. Hays: As a young mother and an American citizen interested in the welfare of our youth, I protest the great and unnecessary use of alcohol and tobacco in motion pictures. In addition to holding up before young people false standards and ideals, so much drinking and smoking by their heroes and heroines, I believe, represents the characters falsely. I refer specifically to such pictures as The Thin Man series wherein Nick Charles drinks incessantly, and continually puffs on a cigarette and yet always is up to solving the crime brilliantly. People I have known who drink and smoke to an extreme are not lovable individuals and are not worth two cents in an emergency. It is my sincere hope in writing you that action can be taken to eliminate an evil which has a far-reaching effect upon the lives of our young people. Yours very truly, (Signed) Mrs. Helen A. Perkes -JULY 1943 Tch! Tch! Grandma! Olive W. Burt O all outward appearances, this summer morning was just like all the others. The family sat crouched behind wide-spread newspapers, reaching out groping hands for buttered toast and orange slices. Grandma, alone in her little newspaper-walled world, found plenty to do, keeping food within reach of those bodiless hands. Yes, it did seem just like all other mornings. Breakfast over, the girls rose and stretched and moved into the living room. Judith turned on the radio and curled up in a big chair with a mystery story; Patty sat down and began to do her nails; their mother puttered about with the house plants, and their father dashed out of the house, in his usual rush to get to work. "It's a lovely day, isn't it?" Jessica asked without looking up from the _geranium from which she was plucking dried leaves. "I think I'll try to get a few moments to knit on that afghan I've been doing for the Red Cross for the past six months." Grandma began to clear the table. In the wrinkled old face the blue eyes were alive and young with resentment. She had thought maybe today would be different. She had done what she could to change it, but apparently it was of no use to try. She scraped the dishes and piled them high in the sink. Dishes! Grandma's stomach contracted with distaste. How many millions of dishes had she done in her lifetime? She had begun wrong, she guessed, being born the youngest girl in a big family. Her first job had been to wash dishes while her older sisters did all the exciting things like making cakes and cookies and gingerbread, unrestrained in their efforts, because they knew Mary would have to do the dishes they stacked up. Then she had married, and there were dishes three times a day. Dishes and babies. There had been a half respite in the years after the children were grown and married, when Frank had been there to help her after every meal. Then he had gone on and she had come to live with Jessica, and do dishes. This was all they thought she was good for, all of them. Let her go for a visit to John's or to Joseph's or Agatha's, and the dishwasher took a vacation. The telephone rang. Book, nail polish, flowers scattered to the four winds as the family made a dash for the phone. Patty got there first. The inviting smile was wiped from her face as she dropped the receiver and said listlessly, "It's for you, Grandma." Patty returned to her nails. Grandma came slowly to the telephone. She hoped the family wouldn't notice her eagerness. She picked her answers carefully, mostly monosyllables; "Yes. Yes? Tomorrow? Yes. All right." She went back to the kitchen. The dishes were still distasteful, but Grandma wasn't thinking about them now. She turned on the water
Page 399

and sprinkled the soap powder into it. It fluffed up. The phone rang again. "It's for you again, Grandma!" called Patty. The family wasn't curious yet, but if they had been they wouldn't have heard a great deal. The third time they had to call to her, though, they did listen, and when the fourth voice asked for Mrs. Sheldon there was frank impatience and curiosity in their faces. "What is it, Mother?" Jessica asked, but Grandma just said breezily, "A little war work I'm trying to do." There was no use to try to pry further. If Grandma wanted to talk, nothing could stop her; but if she didn't want to talk, well, nothing could start her. Jessica was pretty sure it was some doubtful project, but she'd hear about it sooner or later. Grandma went into the kitchen, took off her apron and hung it up. Then, with pencil and notebook she sat down near the telephone. "You aren't going to keep the phone all day, are you?" asked Judith. "I'm expecting a call." "So am I!" answered Grandma tartly. "Your friends will have to take the same chance mine do." It must have been an hour later that Patty went into the kitchen for something. "Why, Grandma!" she cried, "The dishes aren't done!" "Aren't they?" asked Grandma sweetly. "You know they're not!" Patty was accusing.-JULY 1943
"I didn't know anything about it. I know I didn't do them," Grandma went out of the room and up the stairs. Jessica looked at her daughters. "Something must be wrong with Grandma," she said. "You girls better do the dishes this morning." It wasn't as simple as that, but the dishes were finally done. About that time Grandma came downstairs, hatted and coated, and stepping spryly along. "Where are you going, Grandma?" asked Jessica sharply. "To work," said Grandma, and opened the door. Then she turned back. "I am willing to pay for my board and room, Jessica, now that I've got a job that pays me," she said. "Or I can go somewhere else to live if you'd rather. I've had two offers of a home this morning with pay! I didn't take them, but I can. I am going to work now, everyone else is working but you and the girls, and as your part of the war effort, you can do your own dishes!" She shut the door sharply and walked briskly down the street. Jessica looked bewildered. "Grandma, of all people!" said Judith. "And what kind of job can she get, an old woman like that!" "Oh," said Patty slowly, "One of the women this morning said something " she grabbed the morning paper and rifled the pages, stopping to study one intently. "Yes, here it is!" She read aloud: "Elderly woman in excellent health and fond of children would like to care for babies of defense workers. Day work preferred. Dial 6-4220. Mrs. Sheldon,"

Chapter IV
Synopsis: Janet, protectingly reared in Washington, D. C., lives in constant dread of the San Juan country of Utah where her husband, Paul Morgan, has an Indian trading post on the mesa. She plans on their moving to Washington before the birth of her baby, but does not disclose this intention to her husband. Upon returning home with Paul after a happy week spent on the mesa, they find that Janet's sister, Rhae, and her husband Warren Newsbaum, have arrived for a short visit with the announced intention of taking Janet back to Washington with them. The next morning Paul is hurt when he saves Warren from being dragged by a broncho.
Except for Juanee, there wasn't a soul within fifteen miles of the trading post. Paul, Indian Joe, Juanee's husband, and the rest of the ranch outfit were out on the winter range getting ready for the spring roundup. An open winter and months of warm rains had kept the range in good shape; cattle were rolling fat; steers would be ready for the market weeks ahead of time. Paul had little time for anything else. But being alone had long since ceased being a terror to Janet. There was so much to be done before the coming of the baby that she had no time for worry or unpleasant thoughts. Even the country seemed less appalling. Since the day, months ago, when Caesar had almost killed Paul, she had known she could never leave El Toro unless Paul came, too. There would never again be any doubt of that, but she still clung to the thought that someday she would win him away. But now, after the long slow months of his recovery, Paul seemed more entrenched than ever. As soon as he was well enough to be out on the range again, he had plunged into an orgy of buying and selling that frightened her. If he became too involved, he would be less easily uprooted; less inclined to turn things over to an overseer as she meant him to do. Seeing him lying there with broken bones and helpless, idle hands, she had said over and over again that only his life mattered. Where she lived or what she did was unimportant. She smiled, now, at the thought of how Rhae and Warren even the nurse and the specialist that Warren had imported to care for Paul had conspired to get her to terminate what they called her self-inspired martyrdom, using her condition as the hatchet over her head. "I'll go to a hospital if Paul is well enough to go with me," she had promised them, and nothing they could say had changed her mind. "I could have a specialist come here, couldn't I? Just as you came to Paul, Dr. Meade." "Having a baby out of a hospital is impossible!" Rhae cried indignantly. "Father would not hear of such a thing. Mother always had the best hospitals."

"Yet mother died." Janet replied softly. "And Juanee was confined right here in her hogan back of El Toro and nothing happened at all." Then brightly: "Except that she presented the reservation with its first twins in fifty years!" "You make me sick!" Rhae scorned. "How can you talk like that? You'd think you were a common common " "Squaw? Or one of the dozens of fine women I know here in the desert?" Janet was positively delighted at the strength of her own arguments. She had almost believed them herself! Thinking of it now it didn't seem so funny. She'd go to a hospital of course. Paul wouldn't hear of anything else, they'd planned that as soon as they were alone, and he was well enough to sit out in the patio and talk. But, though Paul was coming home to go to Washington with her, she didn't want to go at all. She sighed. El Toro was so lazy and comfortable. Facing the old life again after nearly four years of isolation, was a bit terrifying. She'd probably shy from a train as range horses did from an automobile! And she didn't even have fashionable clothes. But that, too, was easily remedied. With money to burn if she wanted it, she could buy to her heart's content. Juanee came in with a log for the fire. Janet held up the tiny dress she was embroidering. "How does that look, Juanee? Isn't it adorable?" "It is too white. It is too small. My twin boys would spoil that in one minute. Mister Paul will be home tonight. He will say you should buy Levis for a boy!"-JULY 1943
"Yes, he would. He has named the child already. It's to be Jerry. I call him Paul." "You better start thinking up names in case a girl comes." "Juanee, don't you go predicting a girl. Paul would be devastated." "But you love what comes. Huh? Mister Paul, too." "You're a great comfort, Juanee. You have better sense than most women." Juanee smiled broadly. "Miss Janet nice woman, too!" Janet laughed. "Thanks Juanee. How are the twins? Do they like being at the school?" "Not now. Soon they will, just like their papa and mama did. Are we not warm and comfortable here with you because of the school? My begays will learn to like the school." "It must be grand to have twins!" "Oh, yes! You like to have twins?" Janet laughed in surprise. "Oh, no, Juanee. One is all I could manage. I'd be scared to death of two!" "You have two big loves or one big love. You give me two dollars or one dollar, I take two dollars!" Juanee brushed the last spark from the hearth and went back to her work.
A car wheezed into the yard and Janet knew Dr. Potsworth had come to make his weekly call. He was a lovable, shrewd old man, and a valuable doctor. She knew he'd like to officiate at her child's birth, here at El Toro, just as he'd brought hundreds of other babies into other homes, without fuss or bother. She'd a notion to take him along to Washington with her when she went to the hospital.
TOMORROW'S CUP
The thought conjured up such a picture of Rhae's horror at sight of the fat, bewhiskered little man, that Janet laughed aloud. "Fine, Janet, fine!" Dr. Potsworth exclaimed, coming in at the door. "I wish I had a strong, healthy girl like you to be mother to the one that's coming in the trapper's hut down on the river. She's a puny little thing. No spirit. No spirit at all!" When the doctor had gone, Janet sat thinking of what he had said. She knew that "puny little thing down on the river." A slip of a girl who had never known hardship until she married a man of her family's choosing, a Frenchman of many promises and good looks. They had finally, after years and years of poverty and hardship, come to this. The trapper's wife was the one that should be going to the big hospital, the good food, and the white-clad nurses! This country had broken her spirit as it had her lovely little body. Just as it broke others, stronger than herself! Janet's peace was gone. The floodgates were raised, letting her emotions tumble pell-mell over each other. All the fears she had accumulated crowded in with renewed force, stronger for their enforced idleness. "Spirit!" Janet stood up angrily. "Poor little trapper's wife. She hasn't a chance! Oh, if Paul only knew how I hate, how I " Taos woke abruptly. Not, Janet could see, from anything she had done, but from uneasy intuition. He sniffed the air and went toward the door. Janet followed and opened it, letting him out. For a minute she could see nothing to be excited
403
about, and was about to draw the dog inside and close the door, when a horseman came up over a ridge to the east. Janet hugged herself against the damp wind, debating whether to go in or wait. Long before she could see the rider clearly, she knew it was an Indian. Only lithe, bareback riders have that motionless grace. No flapping of arms or legs, no body motion except the rhythm of balanced posture. "See, Taos, it's only an Indian begay a boy." Janet was as calm as if it had been one of Juanee's twins. Taos continued to growl. Juanee came to the door and stood by Janet. "That's Mike's begay," she said. "He's a no good boy!" "What does Mike's begay want?" Janet demanded the minute the boy slid from his horse. "I come here." He pointed to Juanee, and after that he talked rapidly in Navajo, ignoring Janet entirely. Janet was more piqued than she cared to admit. Why hadn't she taken the trouble to learn Navajo. Mike's begay had shifty eyes, and she didn't like the way he peered into the rooms behind her. She gave Taos a tug on his collar and drew him reluctantly, inside, closing the door after him. The minute they were left alone, Juanee's voice became suspicious, low-pitched; the Indian boy's more persuasive. Janet listened nervously. It was silly to imagine things every time anyone came on the place. Yet why was it that as soon as Paul went away, even for a day, every renegade on the reservation seemed to know it, and to take advantage of his absence. Nowhere was there a more crafty In-
404
dian than Mike, and his boy looked equal to his breed. Perhaps she had cause to feel nervous. Juanee came in. "My mother is very sick," she said. "Mike's begay says she will die. She wants me to come." Her voice was so filled with a mixture of doubt and anguish that she could hardly speak the words. "But you just came home from your father's hogan, Juanee," Janet protested. "Your mother was not sick then!" "That is what I cannot understand. But the begay brings this to make me know." Juanee held up an exquisite silver cross, set with turquoise. "My mother say she keep this until she die, then it is for me. That is how I know that Mike's begay does not lie." "You must go at once, Juanee," Janet said, sorry for even a moment's doubt of the Indian woman's faithfulness. "But I cannot leave you, Miss Janet!" "Of course you can. I'm perfectly well, and Mr. Paul will be home tonight." Juanee shook her head mournfully, looking first at the Indian boy, waiting, astride his horse, then at her mistress. Janet noted her uneasiness and it increased her own. But there was no help for it. Juanee must go to her people. "You must go, Juanee," she urged. "Send your cousin Myrrup back to stay with me if it will make you feel easier. Now hurry!" Juanee hesitated, clutching the silver cross. She went to a desk, took out a small pistol, held it up significantly, and placing it on the mantel above the glowing fire, said: "Mr.-JULY 1943
Paul taught you to use this, Miss Janet; he know someday you may need to shoot very straight!" Janet laughed nervously. "I'll scare the daylight out of anyone who bothers me," she boasted, "so please hurry!" Under her breath she added, "Before I weaken." "May the Father of my people remember to walk by this house," Juanee said, and, turning, went out. A few minutes later she rode around the corner of the house on her own horse, and was gone, one twin in her arms, the other blanketed to her back. The Indian boy rode after them across the flats. Taos strained at his collar, but Janet held him in. "It's all right, Taos," she assured him. "Come and lie down by the fire."
She sewed for an hour, watching Taos between times. "Why don't you go to sleep?" she said finally. "You make me nervous with your watching." Taos thumped his tail but remained attentively awake. In the warm silence Janet dozed, only to be suddenly awake again. Why, she didn't know. Taos had not even raised his head, but his hair bristled and his eyes searched her face. She reached over and patted his head, thinking she'd be better off alone, he was such an old fuss-budget. The clock ticked. The fire crackled. A log fell apart and rolled out on the hearth. Janet took the tongs and put the log back on the fire. Taos whined to get out and she opened the door for him, leaving it ajar so he could come in again. Five minutes passed. Ten. "Taos!" she called sharply. "Come in!" "He no come in. He dead." Janet whirled toward the guttural
TOMORROW'S CUP
voice behind her. "Mike!" she gasped. "How did you get in this room? What are you doing here?" The Indian smiled insolently. "White squaw very nice," he said. "Me want whiskey! You come store." Janet was trying desperately to hide her fear. "You know there is no whiskey in the store. Paul Morgan knows whiskey is bad medicine. He will whip you if he finds you here." "You come store," the Indian said savagely. "Me no key," Janet said. Her first panic was over. She'd show this filthy savage she wasn't afraid of him or his country either. "You heap key. Me no fool. White squaw get key or me shoot!" "You haven't a gun, Mike, or you'd have used it before this. Now get out!" She whirled to the mantel. "I have a gun, see?" Mike backed away from the gun she whipped into his face, but his eyes lost none of their insolent assurance. "Me knife!" he said, and drew a long hunting knife from inside his shirt. "Me kill dog. Me kill you." A dozen guns could not have held the terror for Janet of that long sharp knife. "I'll I'll get the key," she gasped. She backed toward the kitchen door, barely managing to keep the pistol leveled at Mike's head. If only she could get through the door and bolt it there might be time for Paul to come. She turned the knob behind her with her free hand and stepped backward through the door. A shrill laugh stopped her and a small, incredibly strong hand twisted the gun from her fingers. Mike's begay shoved her tri-
405
umphantly aside and took the gun to his father. Janet staggered, threw her desperate weight against the door, bolting it with the strong oak latch. "Taos! Where are you?" She shuddered. Taos was dead or he'd be tearing Mike to shreds. She could hear Mike swearing, searching for the store key. She backed along the wall. "Paul! Oh, please come now, Paul!" She prayed. "Father in Heaven, what shall I do?" Suddenly the answer came. In her backing along the wall she had bumped into the big cupboard that hid the trap door to the Devil's Corridor. She remembered her husband's laughing words as they had climbed up the corridor, that never-to-be-forgotten day, and out onto the mesa: "If any Indians ever try to get funny with you, Janet, just you remember this crack. You can get to it from the kitchen... Trap door under the big cupboard...." She dropped to her knees, shoved a stack of magazines aside from the floor of the cupboard, and crawled in, closing the door carefully behind her. To breathe in such a cramped position was nearly impossible. She tugged at the back panel; it slid to one side, revealing a flight of steep steps that led to a small cave at the mouth of the corridor. Once down these steps and into the corridor she'd be safe. Mike would never find her there. She descended the steps and stood listening. A splintering sound over her head told her that the door she had bolted between herself and Mike had given way. Now, he'd know she was gone. There was a puzzled silence. Then: "Chinde Clish!" in Mike's surprised
406
voice. "Chinde Clish!" his boy repeated, and banged his boots against the cupboard door. Janet's heart stopped. She had not taken time to close the back panel of the cupboard. If the front door came open they would find the corridor. Mike grunted and overturned the table in his disgust. That told Janet she was still safe. She ran along the floor of the rear cave, to where the real corridor began. There the air was better. She'd climb part way up and wait for Paul to come. Sounds from the house grew fainter, going toward the store. A shot echoed along the corridor as if it had been fired into. Shouts from the direction of the store told Janet that Mike was headed that way, that for the time at least, he had forgotten about her. If he hadn't found the store key he would probably shoot out the windows. When he failed to find whiskey, he would set fire to the store and ride sullenly away. He might even set fire to the house. A sob shook her. They couldn't burn her home. Not El Toro! Paul loved El Toro. He must not come home and find it gone. She ran back along the corridor, stumbling blindly, tears drenching her face. Those renegades would find what she could do if they dared touch El Toro! The passage narrowed until she was crouching again, fighting for breath with every step. A sharp pain made her cry out. She had forgotten her condition. The baby was more important than life. She must not go back until Paul came. And she prayed it might be soon. "That was a labor pain!" her mind-JULY 1943
stated, waiting for a second pain as one strains to catch a faint disturbing noise in the night. It came and Janet sat down heavily. "I'm going to have a baby!" she said, "here alone!" Her words echoed hollowly along the corridor. Restraint snapped. "That's what's happening to me," she cried. "That's what your country is doing to me, Paul Morgan. And I just sit here babbling like an idiot!" A longer pain choked her voice. When it was over, she became suddenly calm. She was being utterly foolish; she had to stop this nonsense. It might be hours before her husband came. Squaws often had their babies alone, and and so could she! She found a sand-covered ledge and curled up on it, determined to relax. Mike must be gone for she hadn't heard a sound for ages. And she couldn't smell smoke. Maybe he wouldn't burn El Toro. A drowsy numbness enveloped her. "It must be sleep," she thought. But her relief was short lived. Pains came in quick succession. "Paul!" His name brought no answer. If only she could get back to the fire; it was cold and damp in the corridor. Paul would never find her here. She slid from the bank, dragging her feet painfully, walking was so hard. If she sat down just for a minute then she could get to the trap door. It was hot and close in the corridor now. What she needed was air fresh air! "Paul " The word died away in the empty distance. Janet sighed and sank quietly in the dark.
