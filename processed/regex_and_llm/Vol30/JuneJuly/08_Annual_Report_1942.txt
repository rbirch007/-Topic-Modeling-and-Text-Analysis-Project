Annual Report 1942
Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer
OBSERVANCE of the Relief Society centennial and increased participation in war services in addition to regular activities, characterized the work of the Relief Society during the year 1942. Adding new interest to the report and further means of more fully gauging the extent of Relief Society services are several new items of data collected for the first time in 1942, such as number of quilts made and number of funerals at which comfort and assistance was given, services which have characterized the work of the Society from its beginning, but which have never before been counted on a Church-wide basis. Unfortunately, complete records were not kept in all local Relief Societies of the newly required data, resulting in what is believed to be a considerable understatement of Relief Society services. Furthermore, because of limitations in shipping facilities incident to the war, current reports were not received from some of the distant missions in time for inclusion in the 1942 compilations. Therefore, figures in the annual report with respect to some of the long-time services and to all of the more recently instituted services relating to the Church Welfare Plan and to the war do not represent the full measure of the accomplishments. Nevertheless, the following statistical data give impressive evidence of the magnitude of the work accomplished. These facts are presented with full realization that they do not attempt to measure all the varied services of the Society to others, or the inestimable and intangible values to the members themselves which come from participation in Relief Society's two-fold program of education and service.
RELIEF SOCIETY CENTENNIAL
Constituting a part of this annual report is the comprehensive summary of the Church-wide celebration of the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Society which was published in Thefor April 1942. This was followed by detailed reports of many of the local observances held in wards, stakes, branches, and missions which have since appeared in the Magazine as "Notes From the Field" in the issues of July, October, November, and December of 1942, and January, February, and March of 1943. The "Notes" in the issues for June 1942, and May 1943, relating to Relief Society choruses of Singing Mothers, should also be considered as a part of this series of centennial reports, as these choruses were extensively featured in centennial programs, concerts, pageants, tree plantings, and other services. The concluding memento of the centennial year was the publication in the fall of 1942 of "A Centenary of Relief Society," commemorating in picture and story the history and achievements of the Society during its first

one hundred years. In the brief period between its publication and the end of the year, 10,298 copies of this handsome book had been purchased. Other personal centennial souvenirs, all of lasting value, had been bought in the following quantities: Relief Society membership pin, 6,677; plate depicting organization meeting, 1,452; and "A Legacy Relief Society Centennial Anthology of Verse," 972. In addition, the official centennial insignia in the form of seals or stickers had been ordered in the amount of 172,800 for attaching to programs of centennial observances, place cards, invitations, correspondence, et cetera. The annual reports showed a total of 874 centennial trees planted, of which 779 were permanently designated by means of a uniform bronze tree marker made available by the General Board.
WAR SERVICES
Relief Society organizations in the United States, constituting the majority of the 2,273 local Societies, undertook various activities related to the war effort during 1942, immediately after the United States became involved in war near the end of the preceding year. Most of the other countries where Relief Societies are located were already engaged in war, and the local Societies in those countries continued their efforts for the relief of war sufferers which were started as soon as their countries became involved.
Curtailment of Travel
The first important change in Relief Society work in the United States due to the war was made with respect to curtailment of travel and reduction of attendant personal expenses, in conformity with recommendations of the First Presidency issued January 17, 1942, months prior to the rationing of gasoline and the restriction of automobile tires for civilian use. In applying the recommendations of the First Presidency to the Relief Society, the General Board on February 19, 1942, announced curtailment of supervisory functions involving travel as follows: 1. Discontinued regular monthly stake and ward officers' union meetings; 2. Discontinued the annual stake Relief Society conferences to which representatives of the General Board are sent; 3. Curtailed to instances of special need visits by General Board members to stakes, and by stake board members to local Relief Societies; 4. Cancelled the semi-annual general
conferences of Relief Society in Salt Lake City, attended by delegates from all stakes of the organization. In addition, it also postponed the elaborate central celebration planned for the observance of the centennial of Relief Society into which many months of planning and preparation had gone. In order to help compensate for the curtailment of these supervisory activities, various suggestions and recommendations were made to help maintain and improve the standard of work despite these restrictions. The effect of these changes is reflected in the annual report by a ANNUAL REPORT decrease of 70 per cent or nearly 1,000 stake and ward officers' union meetings, from 1,397 In 1941 to 419 in 1942, and by a reduction in visits to wards by stake board members of 1,196 or 16 per cent, from 7,454 in 1941 to 6,258 in 1942. The spirit in which these restrictions were accepted and the adjustments made by stakes to help maintain efficiency in the local Relief Societies with these two principal mediums curtailed are demonstrated in the following excerpts, typical of many, from narrative statements which accompanied the annual reports: From Cottonwood Stake in Utah aAlthough we have held only one union meeting during 1942, we feel that the Relief Society work in our stake has grown and that we have had a successful year. We have missed our union meetings but find that the ward officers and class leaders have developed more initiative and are better able to shoulder responsibility. From Long Beach Stake in California  Our stake board members contact the ward board members in their departments by mail every month. Outlines are sent by class leaders and general instructions by officers. A copy of these letters are submitted to our president and we discuss them in our regular monthly board meeting. The ward members likewise take their letters to their respective ward preparation meetings and in this way we try to have a unity of our work. From Highland Stake in Salt Lake City  We greatly appreciate the splendid cooperation of our board members in contacting the wards since the discontinuance of union meetings. Both the board members and the ward class leaders and officers feel the loss of the contact made possible by those meetings, but all have cooperated in a very commendabl  manner in working out plans for their departments. We fee] that our lessons this year have been most successful. Our board members have contacted the wards by telephone, by personal visits both to homes of class leaders and to the wards, and by sending through 415 the mail written outlines and aids. We are very well pleased with the result of their efforts. From Snowflake Stake in Arizona Our annual fall visit to each ward was discouraging to undertake in 1942 as there were no private cars available due to war conditions. It looked like they must be discontinued. However, because of the reorganization of many wards, the stake board saw the need of the visits and met the emergency, though not in so comfortable a style as theretofore. The board members traveled on school busses, milk trucks, commercial busses, poultry trucks and whatnot, to reach the small Societies, sometimes staying overnight until transportation home could be found. But with the inconvenience they likely received more spirituality from the women than ever before, besides enjoying their home life and hospitality. It was a new experience and the sacrifice did good to all concerned. SURVEY OF REGISTERED AND PRACTICAL NuRSES In February 1942, the General Board of Relief Society instituted a survey of registered and practical nurses in all local units in the United States and Canada, which ascertained not only the number of nurses but the number employed and unemployed, and the number available for additional service. Lists of these nurses are maintained in all local units and kept continually up-to-date, and copies are in the files of the stake officers. 'Tabulation of the returns for the Society as a whole revealed, among other interesting data, that several hundred women, in addition to those already employed, could give some nursing service, either fulltime or part-time. It was found that the number of trained nurses, then unemployed, who could give fulltime service could be increased but slightly, possibly due to age, health, or family responsibilities, that the 416 number of trained nurses who could give part-time service could be more than doubled, that the number of practical nurses who could give fulltime service could be doubled, and that practical nurses who could give part-time service could be trebled. Relief Society Nurse Loan Funds Because of the greatly increased demand for trained nurses due to the war, the General Board of Relief Society during 1942 again directed attention to its two nurse loan funds  one for students at standard threeyear hospital nurse training courses, and one to assist graduate nurses to take university public health nursing courses. These loan funds have been in constant use for twenty years. Furthermore, the General Board increased the maximum amount which could be borrowed for hospital nurse training from $75.00 to $300.00 per student in order to more nearly meet present costs of training. Revrer Societies SERVING AS RED Cross Sewing Units In February 1942, the General Board of Relief Society released a plan specifying steps to be taken by local Relief Societies desiring to function as Red Cross units for sewing and knitting, and recommended that Red Cross sewing be done in the regular monthly work meeting of the Relief Society in addition to the sewing ordinarily done for charitable purposes of the Society. Annual reports for 1942 indicate that this recommendation was followed generally throughout the Relief Society, but data as to amount of sewing and knitting accomplished in Relief Society meetings appear to be greatly-JULY 1943 understated because many local Societies failed to keep a full account of the work which was done. Nevertheless, the reports indicate that an average of nearly 8,000 women did Red Cross sewing or knitting in each of the monthly Relief Society work meetings, giving more than 100,000 hours to this volunteer service and completing for the Red Cross 38,- 381 articles. These figures relate only to Red Cross service in connection with Relief Society meetings. They do not include the service of thousands of Relief Society women who have also assisted at Red Cross sewing and surgical dressings centers, nor those who have assisted as Red Cross nurse aids, canteen workers, et cetera. In addition, the Relief Society continued its own sewing program and gave other extra sewing services incident to the war as mentioned below under "Sewing Service." Rep Cross Courses SPONSORED Also in February 1942, the Relief Society recommended to its members everywhere other Red Cross classes and services, such as home nursing, first aid, nutrition, nurse aids, canteen service, et cetera. Supplementing this recommendation, the Relief Society has circularized local units in certain areas, as for example, in Salt Lake City, announcing and highly recommending specific Red Cross classes with the result that these classes have been immediately filled. In a bulletin released at the end of 1942, the General 'Board gave new emphasis to this recommendation, urging that as many women as possible take Red Cross first-aid and home-nursing classes so that they would be better ANNUAL REPORT prepared to care for their families and others in ordinary instances of illness and also in case of disaster or epidemic. This recommendation recognized the increasing curtailment of hospital and nursing service for civilians, and the necessity of depending to greater extent on home nursing. Local Relief Societies were advised, wherever feasible, to provide themselves with the necessary beds and other equipment for demonstration at such home-nursing classes in order to make classes available in immediate vicinities thus reaching a larger number of Relief Society members. It was also recommended that in war risk areas one woman in each stake be called to become a first-aid instructor in order to help make possible an increased number of local classes in Red Cross first-aid training. The 1942 reports show that at least 10,222 Relief Society women completed Red Cross courses during the year, 4,062 in first aid, 3,839 in home nursing, 1,701 in nutrition, and 620 in other subjects. Because of the recommendations issued at the end of 1942, the year 1943 should show that an even greater number of women have completed Red Cross courses, particularly in first aid and home nursing. Other Provisions for First AID AND Home Nursing Continuing the century-long interest and activity of the Relief Society in health and nursing, the General Board, at the end of 1942, issued printed circulars for distribution to every family in the Church, urging that every possible precaution be taken to preserve health through such means as proper nutrition, adequate clothing and bedding, and gen- 417 eral care, and recommended that all families provide themselves with a family first-aid kit for use in case of disaster, accident, or household emergencies. At the same time all ward Relief Societies were asked to establish home-nursing supply chests, containing articles ordinarily needed for home nursing in case of sickness or disability, such articles to be either rented or loaned according to circumstances of families using the supplies. In this connection it is interesting to note from narrative reports from the stakes that the stake board and wards of at least one stake (Rexburg) had jointly purchased a secondhand hospital bed for home nursing purposes. The plan for home-nursing supply chests was an extension of the recommendations issued twenty years earlier that Relief Societies maintain maternity bundles for renting or loaning for home deliveries, a service which is still in effect in some communities without hospital facilities. In addition, all Relief Societies considering themselves to be in war risk areas were asked to provide themselves with a ward first-aid kit, including quilts and blankets, and to make a house-to-house survey among Church families to list articles which could be made available upon call to the ward Relief Society president in case of an emergency entailing temporary housing other than in homes. OrHer War SERVICES During 1942, stake and ward Relief Society funds were invested in war bonds to the extent of $22,451.71. Representatives of the General Board of Relief Society and of stake and local Societies are serving 418 on various state and local committees related to the war effort, including various Red Cross committees, Civilian Defense committees, state and local women's salvage committees, U. S. O. Committees, state and local nutrition and food conservation committees, state and community health organizations, committees on war relief, and committees relating to day care for children of working mothers. In some areas direly needed assistance has been given in recruiting workers for harvesting and processing agricultural products. Early in 1942, the Relief Societies in Salt Lake City conducted a houseto-house survey among members of the Society leaving registration cards for those able to make accommodations available for women and girls coming into the area for defense work. Hundreds of suitable homes were registered by this means; the service of personally inspecting the quarters offered and of making placements has been conducted by the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. The Relief Society has also cooperated with the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association in other activities for the welfare of girls who leave home to take employment. In this connection, in December 1942, Relief Society visiting teachers left in every home with girls of M. I. A. Age a printed "Message of Friendliness-JULY 1943 and Solicitation to the Mothers of the Church" containing timely advice, and encouraging girls away from home to affiliate with the M. I. A. In their new places of residence. Themonthly publication of Relief Society with a circulation of 57,000, carries frequent announcements relating to the salvage program, to the need for nurses, and articles interpreting the government's price control and rationing program. In addition, Thehas carried a series of special articles by psychologists, social workers, and other specialists relating to wartime problems of both youths and adults. Two lesson courses in the 1942-43 series for Relief Societies throughout the United States were pertinent to the present situation one course, presented on the fourth Tuesday of each month and entitled "What 'America' Means" related the history, development, and values of American democracy, using The American Citizens Handbook as a reference; another course for monthly consideration on the second Tuesday of the month was entitled "New Fashioned Thrift" and related to current up-tothe-minute news and suggestions for homemakers, particularly from the standpoint of conservation and consumer buying under present conditions, with special reference to articles curtailed by war needs. RELIEF SOCIETY SERVICE UNDER CHURCH WELFARE PLAN As part of their routine organization 'work, Relief Society women have, during the past five years, supported the Church Welfare Plan in extensive conservation and production work with respect to both food and clothing. 'They have cooperated wholeheartedly in the collection and conditioning of great quantities of used clothing, in the making of hundreds of quilts and other articles of bedding, the weaving of rugs, the production of thousands of pieces of new clothing for men, women and. Chil- ANNUAL REPORT dren, the canning and drying of a tremendous amount of fruits and vegetables, and have helped to raise funds to meet Church welfare assignments in the form of cash. This service is being continued and is now recognized as a direct aid to the war effort. In addition to the sewing service given in Relief Society meetings where 19,446 pieces of clothing were reported to have been made during 1942 for distribution through bishops' storehouses under the Church USUAL RELIEF SOCIETY SEWING SERVICE In addition to sewing done in Relief Society meetings for the Red Cross as already mentioned, the Relief Society continued its own sewing service, making quilts and articles of clothing for distribution to the needy, both direct and through the bishops' storehouses, making quilts to order as an accommodation to families desiring this service and as a means of building up Relief Society funds. Many Relief Societies extended their usual sewing service during 1942 in order to encourage families to provide themselves with adequate bedding, and carried forward plans for assisting families to da so. These plans included quilting by the Society without charge of one or more quilts for each member, and assistance with materials for those families who could not provide their own. In addition, many local Relief Societies arranged to relieve conditions incident to labor shortages at nearby hospitals by making paper bedside bags, hospital gowns, and other supplies. Some Relief Societies also made thousands of drapes for soldiers' club rooms and gave some 419 Welfare Plan, Relief Society women gave a total of 210,346 hours on other projects operated under the Church Welfare Plan, principally on production projects, either locally or at stake or regional sewing and canning centers. Of this total, 38,945 hours were reported as given by women whose families were receiving aid from the storehouses and 171,401 hours were given in volunteer service by women not receiving this aid. SERVICES CONTINUED sewing service for other community purposes. Altogether, an average of 21,000 women gave sewing service at the monthly work meetings for these various purposes, not including the work for the Red Cross, giving a total of nearly 282,000 hours to these activities. When combined with figures relating to Red Cross sewing service, it is found that an average. Of nearly 29,000 women gave sewing service at each monthly work meeting to the total extent of approximately 382,000 hours, during which 116,882 articles were completed. Of this total number of articles, the greatest number (38,381 or approximately one-third of the total) was made for the Red Cross, with 29,048 being made for Relief Society, 19,446 for bishops' storehouses, and 30,007 for hospitals and all other agencies. As to kind of articles made, clothing for children constituted the largest single group, numbering 25,323 atticles. Next in importance were quilts numbering 13,034, followed by 10,141 pieces of women's clothing, 7,908 pieces of men's clothing, 4,610 pieces of other bedding, and 55,866 pieces of other articles including 420 hospital supplies, drapes for soldiers' club rooms, and other miscellaneous articles. COMPASSIONATE SERVICES It is not possible to measure fully the extent of compassionate service given by Relief Society women in their communities. Only a few of the many ways in which they minister to those in sorrow and distress can be satisfactorily counted, but these few items serve to give some idea of the kind and extent of these services. Special visits made to the sick and homebound by women representing the Relief Society were reported to be 116,006 in 1942. This count represented a decline of 74,000 visits or 39 per cent from the year 1941 which may be attributed to several factors including the possibility of less sickness. However, it is quite likely that the major part of this decline was due to renewed emphasis on counting only visits made in the name of Relief Society, with strict exclusion of visits made by Relief Society women to relatives or personal friends. In addition to these visits to the sick, the Relief Society provided 15,083 full days' care of the sick. This item also declined from the previous year by 17,000 days or 54 per cent, reflecting either less sickness or greater unavailability of women to give this service because of increased employment and new war work. In 1942, for the first time, the count of days' care of the sick was segregated between volunteer and paid service. It was found that by far the greater proportion of days' care of the sick was volunteer service by Relief Society women, which accounted for-JULY 1943 95 per cent or more than 14,000 of the 15,000 days' care given, whereas only 687 days or 5 per cent represented days' care of the sick by nurses or others to whom the Relief Society made payment for the service. The total number of bodies prepared for burial by Relief Society women was 882, a decrease of 311 or 26 per cent from the count of 1,193 in 1941. In 1942, for the first time, the count of this service was segregated between bodies completely prepared for burial where services of morticians were unavailable, and bodies to which Relief Society women gave only the service of dressing. Complete preparation for burial was made by Relief Society women with respect to more than onefourth of the bodies (252) whereas the service of clothing the body was provided in 630 instances. 'The 1942 count of number of funerals at which Relief Society women assisted was the first count of a service which Relief Society women have given from the beginning of the organization. This assistance was reported in connection with 4,315 funerals and consisted of service such as decorating the chapel, arranging floral offerings, and giving any needed service to bereav d families. VISITING 'TEACHING The number of monthly visits to families by Relief Society visiting teachers during 1942 totaled 1,1096,168, a decrease of 75,235 or 6 per cent from the previous year. 'This decline is attributed principally to war transportation conditions. Early in 1942, the General Board released plans for dividing visiting teachers' districts into smaller sub-districts so that more homes would b  within ANNUAL REPORT walking distance in those areas where homes are scattered and transportation is ordinarily required for visiting. Even so, lack of transportation facilities has made it impossible for many visits to be made. Realizing that this would be the case, provisions were made for recording and counting communications in lieu of visits, such as messages sent by mail and telephone calls. 'These communications in lieu of visits amounted to 17,518 offsetting only partially the decline in actual visits made. In 1942, for the first time, the count of visits was segregated between families found to be at home when visited, and those not home. According to these data, Relief Society teachers found families at home in 69 per cent of the visits made, and in 31 per cent of the visits no one was   home. Lacking comparative data for previous years, it is assumed that the proportion of families not home when visited was high in 1942 due to war conditions such as increased industrial employment of women and greater absence from home occasioned by volunteer service in war work. Although careful account has always been kept in the wards of the individuals making voluntary contributions to the Society through the visiting teachers, some idea of the total number of families contributing was compiled for the first time in 1942. These data show that the average number of families making contributions each month was approximately 38,879, 22 per cent of the reported total of 177,000 Latterday Saint families. It is realized however, that the total number of different families making contributions doubtless exceeded this num- 421 ber considerably, as some families may have contributed one month and not another. The annual reports indicate that contributions received by the visiting teachers aggregated $117,706.72 for the year, of which $66,909.68 went into the Relief Society charity fund, and $50,- 797.04 into the general fund. Relief Society Meetings HELP The General Board, and stake, ward, and mission Relief Societies conducted a total of 74,657 meetings during 1942, a decrease of 1,613 or 2 per cent from 1941, despite the organization during the year of 5 new stakes and 2 new missions, 14 more ward Relief Societies and 57 more branch Relief Societies in missions. Local Relief Society meetings of all types held declined but slightly, whereas stake meetings were fewer by 1,321, or 34 per cent, dropping from 3,889 in 1941 to 2,568 in 1942. The decrease in stake meetings was due principally to the curtailments required incident to the war discontinuance of union meetings except as especially authorized, and limitation of stake board meetings to not more than one a month. Stake and ward officers' union meetings declined 70 per cent from 1,397 to 419, but this loss was partly offset by 393 modified stake meetings, held in connection with other gatherings, or as opportunity afforded. Stake board meetings dropped 35 per cent, from 2,492 to 1,621. A decline of 85 or 5 per cent was recorded in the number of annual ward Relief Society conferences held, which numbered 1,611 in 1942 as compared with 1,696 in 1941. Preliminary officers' meetings were held in connection 422 with 1,172 of the 1,611 ward conferences, in accordance with a new recommendation to this effect by the General Board. In i942, the General Board recommended the holding of regular monthly officers' preparation meetings in wards. Altogether, these ward preparation meetings totaled 7,024 during the year. Monthly training meetings for visiting teachers totaled 8,005. Opportunity for the Relief Society to participate in the program of one session of the stake quarterly conference once during the year was provided in 89 of the 143 stakes. The regular ward Relief Society meetings for members (weekly during eight-month period October through May, and monthly during four-month period May through September), totaled 54,244. Each of these meetings was attended by an average of 31,270 members representing 29 per cent of the total member-JULY 1943 ship. This was a decline in average attendance of approximately 10,000 members per meeting from 1941, when the average attendance represented nearly 36 per cent of the total membership. This drop in attendance of 24 per cent from the previous year is attributed largely to increased employment of women during this war period. The count in 1942 by types of meetings makes it possible to analyze for the first time the attendance in relation to the different lesson courses presented in rotation at the four weekly meetings during the educational season, October through May. The first meeting of the month, devoted to theology and testimony-bearing, is the best attended in both the stakes and missions, with each succeeding meeting. Of the month declining slightly in popularity at about the same rate in both stakes and missions, as shown in the following summary table: Average Attendance at Local Relief Society Meetings Wards in Stakes 29,100 27,297 26,447 26,034 27,219 Branches in Missions 3,943 3,897 3,827 3,706 4,051" All Relief Societies 33,043 31,194 30,274 29,740 31,270 *Total average attendance high in relation to attendance by type of meeting because type of meeting not reported by all mission branches. A topic in homemaking is provided by the General Board for optional use for discussion in the monthly work-and-business meeting, which is devoted principally to sewing. The 1942 report indicates for the first time the extent of the use of this optional topic. This home topic was discussed at 9,062 or 53 per cent of the total of 17,157 work-and-business meetings held. These topics were more widely used in the stakes than in the missions, being discussed in 7,746 or 60 per cent of the 12,824 work meetings held in the wards, and in 1,316 or 30 per cent of the 4,333 work meetings held in the missions. These topics are not provided for the

ANNUAL REPORT
four summer work meetings, reducing to 67 per cent the maximum percentage attainable if the topics were used in all work meetings. Tuesday is the traditional Relief Society meeting day, but because of transportation problems incident to the war, many local Societies have found it expedient to meet prior to or in connection with Sunday School. The 1942 annual report indicates that approximately half of the local Societies still meet on Tuesdays, and that the rest meet on other days. Some stakes have reported an increased attendance at the Sunday meetings but the need of careful planning in order to make the most of the more limited time available for Relief Society business and class work. Relief Society work meetings are of course held on a week day.
RELIEF SOCIETY MEMBERSHIP
The number of Relief Society members declined during 1942 from 115,015 to 107,282, a loss of 7,733 or nearly 7 per cent. Two principal factors contributed to this decrease: First, in the preceding four-year campaign for 100,000 members, some women joined the organization who were not genuinely interested. Many of these have since become deeply interested and ardent workers but others have withdrawn their membership. The major factor in the membership decrease, however, is doubtless the changed conditions incident to the war. Thousands of families have moved from their home communities to areas adjacent to war industries. In many instances the women in these families have failed to identify themselves with the Relief Society in their new location, many
423
of them because they themselves have taken full-time employment. In view of these conditions, the number of members on record as of the end of 1942 is considered to be a wholesome indication of the genuine and continued interest of the women of the Church in their organization. Although a great many of them are unable to participate fully in the work of the Society under present conditions, they value and retain their membership.
An analysis of the total members according to assignments in the Society indicates that as of the end of 1942, 10,851 or 10 per cent were in executive and supervisory positions in wards, stakes, missions, and on the General Board. Class leaders in local Relief Societies numbered 7,732; visiting teachers totaled 29,371, a slight decline of 581 or 2 per cent from the number of visiting teachers in the previous year. Because of its size, this group of visiting teachers is one which would be expected to reflect to greatest extent the effect of increased employment of women, and it is encouraging to find that it has been possible to maintain this large corps of workers with so small a decline. Other workers with special assignments were reported at 4,514, leaving a total of 55,814 other members (52 per cent) without special assignment as of the end of the year.
Among those with special assignments are the stake and localrepresentatives who during 1942 increased the paid subscription list to a new high circulation of 56,500 as compared with 55,000 in the previous year. A total of 383 of these Magazine representatives earned a free award subscription
424
by procuring subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of the Relief Society membership in their respective local Relief Societies. Even so, only slightly more than half (53 per cent) of Relief Society members subscribe for the Magazine. However, 17,207 or 74.5 per cent of the 23,097 officers and class leaders are subscribers.
FUNDS EXPENDED
Total disbursements of local, stake, and mission Relief Societies and the General Board during 1942 aggregated $462,342.11. Of this amount, $87,882.32 or 19 per cent was spent for charitable purposes, and $374,459.79 for general operating expenses and the Society's educational work. Included in charitable disbursements were amounts issued as direct relief to needy families, payments for health work, and other Relief Society welfare projects. In addition, com--JULY 1943
modities with an estimated value of $5,930.89 contributed to the Relief Society, including donations in kind received by visiting teachers were distributed to the needy bringing total charity disbursements to $93,813.21 and total expenditures to $468,273.00.
In health work, the Cottonwood Stake Relief Society continued operation of its modern maternity hospital in Salt Lake County and this and several other stakes continued to cooperate with local public health workers in the conduct of clinics for pre-school children, immunization programs, special health education work, and health work of other types.
Total net assets of the Society, including cash on hand, wheat trust funds, other invested funds, value of real estate and buildings, furniture and other properties were reported to be $1,348,603.41.
WAR WORK AND RELIEF SOCIETY
In Oakland Stake, California
With war conditions changing the habits and ways of living for so many of us, we of the Relief Society are attempting to tie much of our time in with this vital work, thus not only doing some of the necessary volunteer tasks of today, but also keeping women who wish to do war work happy at Relief Society.
For instance, we gave forty-eight woolen patchwork quilts to the Red Cross just recently. These quilts were made after our welfare assignment for 1942 had been completed and before we received our 1943 budget. We produced these quilts from scrap pieces left from our reconditioned articles at the stake welfare plant. The batts are of repossessed wool obtained from moth-eaten scraps and hopelessly worn sweaters and swim suits. The scraps were carded for us by a local factory until it was forced into war work. Now we send them to Logan, Utah, to be made into batts.
We were able to give the Red Cross six huge boxes of fur scraps to be fashioned into seamen's vests. These scraps were a by-product of our reconditioned clothing project.
We urge blood donors and surgical dressing workers to go in groups as Relief Society women rather than as individuals. This procedure actually gets more war work accomplished and at the same time stimulates Relief Society attendance and work.
In connection with the drive to put a family first-aid kit in every home, we are advising that each kit contain one or more units of homemade heat. Each unit is about one cubic inch in volume and will produce twenty to thirty minutes of heat equal to five candlepower, giving ample opportunity to boil instruments for sterilization or any other emergency activity. They cost only a fraction of a cent, each being made of old newspaper and paraffin. We have demonstrated the making and use of this heat in our various wards. Ruth S. Hilton, President Oakland Stake Relief Society.

Articles of Faith
Preview of Lessons for 1943-44
THE third and final year of the study of the Articles of Faith by James E. Talmage will be completed during the Relief Society educational year 1943-44. There will be eight lessons, the first to be presented the first Tuesday of October 1943, and the final lesson to be presented the first Tuesday of May 1944. The lessons follow the chapters in the book in consecutive order beginning with Chapter 17. The first five lessons deal with the Tenth Article of Faith, the sixth lesson with Article Eleven, the seventh with Article Twelve, and the eighth with Article Thirteen. The subjects by months are as follows:
* October The Dispersion of Israel
* November The Gathering of Israel
* December Zion
* January Christ's Reign on Earth
* February Regeneration and Resurrection
* March Religious Liberty and Toleration
* April Submission to Secular Authority
* May Practical Religion
The material to be printed each month in the Magazine will consist of three divisions: first, a condensation of each chapter; second, suggested class procedure for the teacher's use; and third, supplementary material quoted from statements of our latter-day prophets, the Presidents of the Church.
While it is believed that most Latter-day Saint families own copies of the Articles of Faith by Talmage, still in order that every class member may familiarize herself with the lesson, a condensation of each chapter with scriptural references will be printed in the Magazine each month as was done for the year 1942-43.
Reports frequently come to the General Board of the enjoyable theological lessons which are presented in the wards. It is the desire of the General Board, however, that not only should the lessons be enjoyable, but also that class members should actively participate in the lessons. One of the best ways to grow is by activity, and through class members participating in a lesson they will grow in knowledge. In order to suggest to the teacher various ways of procuring more active participation in her lesson, the second division of the Magazine material is provided. Under "Suggestions for Class Procedure," each
Page 429
430
month a different method will be suggested which is suited to the subject matter under discussion. These suggestions will be simple and any teacher who carefully chooses the class members to participate, with a view to their individual qualifications and needs, will find the suggestions helpful.
When class members are given assignments, it is desirable to allot them a definite length of time in which to present these assignments, impressing upon them the importance of staying within the time limit. Anyone who goes over her allotted time not only takes time away from someone else, but may interfere with the complete development of the lesson as planned by the class leader.
Class leaders are requested to urge class members to bring with them each theology day the standard works of the Church, and opportunity should be given class members to use these books. This will better familiarize them with the Scriptures, and will encourage home study and class participation. If desired, the class leader might check on the number of Church books brought to class each month by a show of hands, a checking list, or some other simple device.
The third division of the Maga--JULY 1943
zine material, the "Supplementary Material," containing quotations from the writings and statements of the Presidents of our Church, will enrich the lessons. No supplementary material is presented for the first lesson in October on "The Dispersion of Israel."
Class leaders are advised against controversial discussions on matters which have not been revealed; for example, the whereabouts of The Lost Tribes of Israel. Such discussions waste time and are fruitless.
This three-year study of what the Church believes our Thirteen Articles of Faith should be of great benefit to the women of the Church. It should increase their knowledge of the Gospel, enrich their lives, and strengthen their testimonies. We are thankful for the theological teachers in the Relief Society who realize that they can teach nothing except they live what they teach; who appreciate the great responsibility which is theirs to lead their sisters along the path of life and salvation; and who by prayer, by study, and the inspiration of the Lord teach their sisters and encourage them, by participation, to grow in the knowledge of the Gospel. May the Lord bless such teachers in their work, and may they magnify their callings.
Lesson 17 The Dispersion of Israel
(Tuesday, October 5, 1943)
(This is the first of five chapters which deal with Article 10)
Article 10 "We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; * * *"
431
Lesson Aim: To show how Israel lost its identity as a nation and its freedom as a people for rejecting God, and how the Lord overruled its great losses for the good of the whole world.
CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 17, ARTICLES OF FAITH
(This condensation is placed in the Magazine in the hope that it will result in more class members familiarizing themselves with the lesson.)
Israel
The combined name and title, Israel, in the original sense of the word, expressed the thought of one who had succeeded in his supplication before the Lord: "soldier of God," "one who contends with God," "a prince of God," are among the common English equivalents. The name first appears in sacred writ as a title conferred upon Jacob, when he prevailed in his determination to secure a blessing from his heavenly visitor in the wilderness, receiving the promise; "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." (Gen. 32:28) But the name of the individual patriarch grew into the designation of a people, including the twelve tribes, who delighted in the title Israelites, or children of Israel.
At the death of Solomon, probably about 975 B. C., the kingdom was divided. The tribe of Judah and part of the tribe of Benjamin accepted Rehoboam, son and successor of Solomon, as their king; while the rest of the people, usually spoken of as the Ten Tribes, revolted against Rehoboam, choosing Jeroboam as their king. The Ten Tribes under Jeroboam retained the title Kingdom of Israel, while Rehoboam and his subjects were known as the Kingdom of Judah.
For about 250 years the two kingdoms maintained a separate existence; after which, about 721 B. C., the independent status of the kingdom of Israel was destroyed, and the people were brought into captivity by the Assyrians. The Kingdom of Judah was recognized for over a century longer, and then was brought to an end by the Babylonian captivity. For seventy years the people remained in subjection in accordance with the prophecy of Jeremiah. (Jer. 25:11-12; 29:10) Then the Lord softened the hearts of the ruling kings, and Cyrus, the Persian, permitted the Hebrew people to return to Judea and rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The people then commonly known as Hebrews or Jews, retained as the name of their nation the appellation "Israel," though they scarcely comprised two complete tribes out of the twelve. Used in a figurative manner to designate the covenant people who constituted the Church of Christ, (Rom. 9:6; Gal. 6:16) it is still employed in that sense. The Israelites, as first we meet them in history, were a united people.
The Dispersion of Israel Foretold
The dispersion of Israel was brought about by many stages, and
432
extended through millenniums. It was foreseen by the early prophets and the spiritual leaders of every generation.
Biblical Prophecies
Biblical prophecies predict blessings beyond the power of the unaided mind of man to conceive, conditioned only upon obedience to the laws of righteousness; and terrible, soul-harrowing, abject misfortune, including the scattering of the people among those who knew not God, if they departed from the path of rectitude. (Lev. 26:14-33; Deut. 28:25-64; I Kings 14:15; Isa. 5:1-7, 13; 10:3; 42:24-25; Jer. 7:12, 15; 9:11; 10:22; 34:17; Ezek. 20:23; 22:15; 34:6; 36:19; Amos 7:17; 9:9; Micah 3:12; Amos 9:9; Zech. 10:9)
Book of Mormon Predictions
The Book of Mormon contains many references to the dispersions that had already taken place, and to the continuation of the scattering. (I Nephi 10:11-13; 13:11-14; 14:14; 15:12-13; 19:12-14; 22:1-4, 7; II Nephi 6:8; 25:14-15; Jacob 5; 6; and many more.) Jesus Himself, after His resurrection, while ministering to the division of His flock on the western hemisphere, refers solemnly to the remnant who were to be "scattered forth upon the face of the earth because of their unbelief." (III Nephi 16:4)
The Fulfillment of These Prophecies
The sacred scriptures, as well as other writings for which the claim of direct inspiration is not asserted, record the literal fulfillment of proph--JULY 1943
ecy in the desolation of the house of Israel. The dividing of the nation into separate kingdoms of Judah and Israel led to the downfall of both. As the people grew in their disregard for the laws of their fathers, their enemies were permitted to triumph over them. The sad fate of the kingdom of Israel had some effect in partially awakening among the people of Judah a sense of their own impending doom.
Since the destruction of Jerusalem and the final disruption of the Jewish autonomy, the Jews have been wanderers upon the face of the earth, a people without a country, a nation without a home.
The Lost Tribes
The resurrected Christ, while ministering among the Nephites on this hemisphere, specifically mentioned "the other tribes of the house of Israel, whom the Father hath led away out of the land" (III Nephi 15:15); and again He referred to them as "other sheep which are not of this land, neither of the land of Jerusalem; neither in any parts of that land round about whither I have been to minister" (III Nephi 16:1). Christ announced a commandment of the Father that He should reveal Himself to them. The present location of the Lost Tribes has not been revealed.
Note: Since the present location of the Lost Tribes has not been revealed, and since there is a wealth of knowledge that has been revealed, it is advisable that no discussions nor speculations be entered into concerning the present location of the Lost Tribes.

SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE
Suggested Songs
Note: The class leader might confer with the ward president and the ward chorister and suggest that the following songs be used:
"Israel, Israel, God is Calling," Latter-day Saint Hymns, page 213.
"God Moves in a Mysterious Way," Relief Society Songs, page 21, Deseret Sunday School Songs, page 292, Latter-day Saint Hymns, No. 49.
"Scripture-finding" Committee
Select a few women to sit around a table in the front of the room, with Bibles, Books of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. Let them find scriptural passages that may be called for in the development of the lesson and have them read these to the class as needed. Of course, every class member should be encouraged to bring her Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants and as the passages of scripture are read, she might turn to her own books and follow the reading. Time allotted for the lesson will not allow for too much scriptural reading; therefore, passages must be carefully selected.
Geography Report
Appoint one member to give a very short report of the geography embraced in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and of Assyria, Babylonia, and adjacent countries, to illustrate the captivities of Judah and Israel.
Note: Many Bibles have small maps. Some of the Seminaries, Sunday Schools, etc., have larger maps of the kingdoms referred to. A large map might be made of wrapping paper and colored crayons.
History Report
Appoint one member to give a 10-minute historical report covering the period from the division of the kingdom at the death of Solomon to the final dispersion of the children of Israel. (For this information see any good Bible dictionary.)
Chronological Table
Charts and tables are short cuts, and if used effectively they readily clarify facts, events, or historical happenings covering long periods of time. The chronological table of the Kings of Judah and Israel taken from A Concise Biblical Encyclopedia based on the Cambridge Companion to the Bible, will be helpful in the preparation of this lesson and is found in the back of the Bible used by most Latter-day Saint missionaries.

Messages to the Home
Sources of Strength
Preview of Lessons for 1943-44
ONE phase of the Relief Society teaching program is the individual teaching done in the homes by the visiting teachers. This type of teaching can be one of the most effective and impressive ways of teaching, and when properly done, brings excellent results. It follows the pattern of the Master Teacher of all. Jesus talked with individuals; "he sat with little groups of people engaged in quiet conversation, listening to their remarks, answering their questions, putting them perfectly at their ease, but at the right moment crystalizing the whole discussion into some great guiding truth."
The visiting teacher has the opportunity of reaching some individuals who do not come under the influence of the class leader who presents a formal lesson in a Relief Society meeting. Her teaching is very informal: she establishes a friendly relationship, finds a common meeting ground by telling a little story, relating an interesting incident, asking a pertinent question or even by requesting a favor that one would be pleased to grant. After this friendly relationship is established, she launches into a discussion of her message through a friendly exchange of ideas or opinions. The hostess is encouraged to talk, and due consideration is given to her ideas. If, for some reason, the hostess is not receptive to a discussion of the subject, a concise and well-formed statement of the message is more effective than a longer presentation. However, the needs of each home differ, and if the visiting teacher offers something that meets a need in the life of an individual, that person will usually listen. The fact that the visiting teacher recognizes the need in a home should not be obvious. If the visiting teacher is sincere, earnest, and prayerful in planning the delivery of the message, she will influence for good the lives of those she visits.
At the regular monthly teacher-training meeting the class leader should keep in mind the great objective of the message; and applying her knowledge of the underlying principles of good teaching, she should aid the visiting teachers in their presentation of these spiritual truths in the homes they will visit by a well-prepared discussion of the subject, and by suggestions on how to present this material when making their visits.
"Sources of Strength" has been chosen as the title for the messages to the home during the two years, 1943-44 and 1944-45. There is almost a universal call during this time of disillusionment, sacrifice, and loss of loved ones, for faith and fortitude to carry on valiantly. There is a constant seeking for sources of courage and strength. This course has been planned to supply this need and should be very acceptable in all Latter-day Saint homes.
For the ensuing Relief Society educational year 1943-44 the following topics are planned:
1. A Firm Belief in God As a Source of Strength. Nothing can give the feeling of peace and security and belief in the ultimate triumph of good as does implicit trust in our Heavenly Father. A firm belief in God gives one the courage to live a normal and happy life.
2. Ordered Living as a Source of Strength. A well-planned life avoids waste of time, inefficiency, and worry. It insures doing the essential things and aids one in maintaining high standards. It is a source of strength.
3. Freedom of Choice as a Source of Strength. Free agency is a basic principle in man's development. One grows strong by making right decisions for oneself.
4. The Development of Strength Through Work. Work contributes to health, wealth, and happiness. It is a panacea for many of the ills of life, a release from mental or emotional strain. There is joy in work well done and in the creations of one's own hands and brain.
435
5. Cooperation as a Source of Strength. An individual may accomplish very little by himself, but by combining his efforts with others he may become powerful and effective. He must learn to get along with others, to be unselfish, loyal, and considerate, and willing to work for the common good rather than for personal interest alone.
6. Companionship as a Source of Strength. Everyone needs companions who call forth the best in him, who impart hope, courage, and confidence. Good books may also be inspiring and strength-giving companions.
7. Loyalty as a Source of Strength. Loyalty is being true to one's best self, to one's ideals, to friends, to country, and to God. It is a primary element in every great and noble character.
8. Love as a Source of Strength. Love is a divine quality. It enriches and ennobles the individual. Love has great power. The Master asked that man love his enemies and do good to those who despitefully use him.
Lesson 1 A Firm Belief in God
(Tuesday, October 5, 1943)
INDIVIDUALS are made strong to endure and to overcome through a firm belief in God. This belief is an unfailing source of comfort and encouragement, a quality much needed in these times. This torn and troubled world needs the assurance that God lives and reigns On High, that He holds in His hands the destiny of men and nations, and in His own time and in His own way He will see that justice is meted out and that righteousness is rewarded. The world needs the assurance that He can hear and answer the appeals of His children; it needs that simple and beautiful faith which enables people to walk with perfect confidence through the mist and shadows of doubt and despair, trusting in the wisdom and goodness of God to lead where the light of reason does not
436
always penetrate; the faith which sees a divine purpose running through the stern and often bitter experiences of life; that sublime faith which sustained Job in the hour of his great affliction and enabled him to say: "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him."
This faith fortifies and strengthens one in the hour of need. It fills the heart with hope and the will with resolution. Through this faith people have achieved almost superhuman things. The Scriptures abound with examples of it, and history is full of proofs of its powers.
A Latter-day Saint boy in the United States Navy was asked a question of this import: "Isn't the Navy the most dangerous field of service?" He replied that he did not know, and said: "I've been taught by my mother that the Lord could hear my prayers as well on the water as He could on the land. If I lose my life, it will be in a good cause; and I've always been taught that the next world is a better one than this. So why should I worry?"
How to build up this confidence in the Creator is an important question which has a clear and definite answer. The Lord has declared through His prophets that "Those-JULY 1943
who do the will of the Father shall know of the doctrines." This applies to the humblest as well as the mightiest. The only way one can have a perfect knowledge that God lives is through keeping His commandments. The good and great men of the past, the men who have achieved nobly for mankind, have been men with a firm faith in God. Such men were Washington, Lincoln, Joseph Smith and others, leaders of the Latter-day Saints.
Questions and Suggestions for Discussion
It is suggested that consideration be given to the best ways of presenting this message in the various homes.
1. How does a firm belief in God give strength to the individual?
2. Name activities that build faith.
3. Give examples from the Scriptures of the power of faith; from present-day experiences.

Modern Housekeeping Methods
Preview of Lessons for 1943-44
THE home topics for optional use on work-and-business day during 1943-44 have been prepared under the general heading "Modern Housekeeping Methods." The objective of the course is to
bring to the attention of homemakers new and approved methods of housekeeping which will enable them to perform the tasks of housekeeping efficiently with minimum effort, thereby releasing as much time as possible for other activities demanded of homemakers in these abnormal times.
Women have been housekeepers since the days of the most primitive homes, but with the changes in the types of homes and improvements in their fittings and furnishings, housekeeping methods have changed and are changing. With homemakers, as with everyone else, it is a healthful attitude to keep an open mind and to appreciate the fact that even though one has followed a certain method of procedure for a long period of time, this does not necessarily indicate it is the best or the only successful method. It is true that there are some fundamentals in every line of endeavor that stand the test of time, but newer and better ways of housekeeping, which conform to changing conditions, are being devised. One should weigh the values of new and different methods, and if they are better than old methods, it is wise to adopt them.
The course "Modern Housekeeping Methods" is designed as a one-year course. Lessons prepared for the eight months, October 1943, through May 1944, will appear under the following titles:
1. Budgeting Time Objective: To gain a greater appreciation of the fact that system and order in the home will bring about efficiency with a minimum expenditure of time and energy.
437
2. Tools for Housekeeping Tasks Objective: To show the relationship of good tools, conveniently placed for use, and properly used, to efficiency in performing household tasks.
3. Floors and Floor Coverings Objective: To show that it is a mark of good housekeeping to preserve the appearance and prolong the usefulness of floors and floor coverings by giving each type the special care best suited to it.
4. Walls, Ceilings, and Woodwork Objective: To show that materials and finishes for walls, ceilings, and woodwork should be selected with an eye to ease of cleaning as well as to beauty, and to suggest special methods for cleaning various types of each.
5. Seasonal Housecleaning Objective: To show through a discussion of modern methods of housecleaning how this important task can be accomplished efficiently with a minimum of confusion and upset to normal living conditions in the home.
6. Windows and Window Fittings Objective: To determine the best methods of keeping windows and their fittings, blinds, curtains, screens, and awnings, clean and attractive.
7. Care of Furniture Finished Wood and Upholstered Objective: To learn the best methods of preserving the beauty and usefulness of furniture, since furniture "strikes the keynote of the home."
8. Dishwashing Objective: To discuss methods of washing dishes with a view to discovering how this monotonous household task can be done in a sanitary way with rapidity and thoroughness.
A perusal of the titles and objectives of these eight lessons will indicate the great interest which they
438
hold for women. They are all subjects dealing with the everyday experiences of a homemaker and will readily provoke worth-while discussion in the class. The formal presentation of the lesson should be short, followed by the discussion. The recommendations of the General Board stated in blue bulletin No. 21, issued November 11, 1941, is restated herewith: "It is suggested that the time for formal presentation of the topic not exceed 15 minutes, during which time sewing be suspended, and that presentation be followed by informal discussion and demonstration where desirable, simultaneously with the sewing or other handwork."
One of the best available sources of reference material is America's Housekeeping Book, compiled by New York Herald Tribune Home In--JULY 1943
stitute, 1941. This book was recommended for use in connection with Home Topics for 1942-43. Copies are still available at the Deseret Book Store, 44 East South Temple, Salt Lake City; regular price $2.50; price to Relief Society workers $2 postpaid.
Helpful bulletins and pamphlets may be obtained by writing to state agricultural colleges, county home demonstration agents, or to the Supt. of Documents, Washington, D. C. For example, the Utah State Agricultural College Extension Service has a bulletin entitled "Practical and Speedy Cleaning Methods" by Effie S. Barrows, which is very helpful. Theother periodicals, and the daily press frequently have worth-while suggestions. Advertisements in national magazines sometimes contain good suggestions.
Lesson 1 Home Management
For optional use on Tuesday, October 12, 1943
THESE lessons are written for homemakers. If some suggestions can be made which will increase the interest of homemakers in the management of their homes, helping them to understand their housekeeping problems more clearly and meet them more effectively, the lessons will have served their purpose.
It has often been stated that the greatness of America lies not in the granaries filled with corn and wheat, nor in the railroads stretching across the continent, nor in the mighty armies now growing stronger every day. The greatness of America lies in the American home and the family.
President Roosevelt said when we entered the war that we would have to work harder and longer than we had ever done before. This has certainly proved true. Today we have before us such serious problems as a war to win, an army to feed, and a peace to plan. In view of these problems each one of us wants to do the best possible job in adjusting her work to meet wartime conditions.
Can women plan for more efficiency in their homework in order to make time for added duties? Through better management and cooperation this is possible. If we use the head more and the feet less that is, if we better organize our work and time we will make the time for other things.
Let's use the Army as an example. Every member of a company has his own housekeeping responsibilities. A schedule is made and followed precisely. The time element is important in each job: making beds on time, cleaning up the rooms, putting away clothing, everything in ship-shape order and on time. No time nor motion is wasted in performing these everyday routine duties. If we would follow this example, our homes would be more efficient and restful, and we would have more time for activities outside the home and more leisure time. In planning our housework we should arrange for each member of the family to have a job and some definite responsibility in the home, whether it be planning the meals or washing the dishes. We should also make a work schedule and assign each household task to a particular day and even the hour of the day when it could be done most quickly and conveniently. The benefits of such a schedule are many: 1. It relieves the uncertainty and nervous strain of never knowing when you'll get things done. 2. It allows more things to be done in a given length of time. 3. It allows planning for leisure pleasures with the comfortable feeling that your housework need not be neglected. 4. It allows planning the work of a parttime helper so that endless repetition of orders is avoided and better help for the money spent is obtained. When a schedule has been followed 439 until it becomes second nature, you run your house it does not run you. How shall we go about making a schedule? _ First write down the jobs that need to be done every day. Next write down the tasks that need to be done on a particular day of the week. Then make a simple weekly chart and assign each job to the day and hour when it can be done most conveniently. (See America's Housekeeping Book, pp. 10, 12.) No two homes are exactly alike, and different conditions affect the work schedule. If there is a small baby, the household schedule must be built around the baby's schedule. Very often little time is left for the countless household tasks, especially if no help is employed; but after all, baby's well-being is of far more importance than any phase of housekeeping, and if some housework has to be neglected or done less thoroughly, this state of affairs should be accepted philosophically. Young children, children of school age, also make it necessary for special adjustments in work schedules. After trying to follow a schedule for a week or more, it is time to check up. Ifa day seems crowded so that it is difficult to do all the work scheduled for that day, there may be a remedy. Here are a few questions that may get to the root of the trouble: 1. Have you tried to do too much in one day? If so, move one or two tasks to less crowded days. 2. Do you know the one best way to accomplish a given task? 3. Do you collect all the material, ingredients, or pieces of equipment that you need for a specific job before you begin? (Example: baking bread, 440 making a cake.) time and steps. 4. Are your housekeeping tools and materials efficient, easy to use, and in good condition? Poor tools slow down work. For example: (a) Is your sink too high or too low for comfort? (b) Is your cleaning equipment right for the jobs to be done? (c) Is your vacuum cleaner or carpet sweeper kept emptied and ready for use? (d) Are your knives sharp? Very important. ) (e) Is the place where the job is to be done, arranged conveniently? (f) Is your kitchen equipment stored at the place where it is used? (g) Is the lighting adequate for the work? (This is very important. ) Are beds set away from the wall so you can make them easily? (i) Is your cleaning closet orderly and well arranged? Can you get things in and out easily? (j) Do you take too long to do a specific job? (Keep a record of the time it takes to do ordinary jobs like dishwashing and making beds.) (k) Are your standards of housekeeping too high? This always saves (This is-JULY 1943 Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Enumerate the values accruing to the housewife from following a work schedule. 2. Relate ways of performing some specific everyday household task that will save time and energy. (Perhaps a demonstration might be arranged.) 3. When would you consider housekeeping standards too high? 4. How may kitchen equipment, such as tables, stoves, sink, refrigerator, etc., be best grouped to save the time and energy of the housewife? (See, "Highlights In Kitchen Planning," Lalene H. Hart, p. 676.) 5. What devices may be employed to adjust working surfaces that are too high? Too low? (See, "Highlights In Kitchen Planning," Lalene H. Hart, p. 679.) 6. Suggest different ways of procuring family cooperation in doing household tasks. Reference America's Housekeeping Book, Chapter I, p- 9 Literature The Bible as Literature Preview of Lessons for 1943-44 PRIME purpose of this course is to give those who follow it an encouraging opportunity to get closer to the Bible. Most folk look upon this Book of Books and rightly so as a sacred volume. "So far as it is translated correctly," it is the word of God. It presents His word, however, in varied impressive forms. Sometimes the divine message is given through straight historical record; at times it comes with directness through commandments; again its spirit is radiated through a beautiful lyric, an ode, a rhapsody; often it is portrayed through an intriguing story LESSON DEPARTMENT or drama or ballad; at other times sublime truths are presented through essays and philosophical discussion; or they may flame forth in divine prophecy. All these forms of literature are to be found in the Bible. First, we shall discover them deftly inwoven in the historical books that portray the story of the chosen people. Literature here is used to illuminate and humanize history. Second, included in the great Book of Books are various books, each devoted to a distinctive type of literature. Thus we have wise sayings in the Proverbs; the songs of Israel in the Psalms; a challenging drama of righteousness in Job; the vision of Zion redeemed in Isaiah. Yet with all this variety of expression, the widely different books and selections that make our Bible are each and all in consonance and harmony with the spirit of the whole. This remarkable unity that magnetizes the varied parts is due to the source of its inspiration. 'Through all the centuries that this sacred volume was being assembled, taught, and finally translated into the tongues of the common folk for their guidance and uplift, one thought was dominant   scribes, rabbis, early Christian fathers and _ translators alike were intent on preserving the word of God. And preserve it they did with remarkable fidelity. 'That was their master service for mankind. In this devotion to a great central ideal, they would seem to have given little heed to literary forms in which the sacred writ was expressed. God's word and will Gospel truth with these inspired leaders was of first concern. Evidence of this truth comes in the form of the Bible as 441 given to us by the translators. Our King James Translation, for example, is cast into a series of chapters, which in turn are broken up into socalled verses. These bits of the sacred writ were intended, we are told, as "texts for comment" or for sermons. Not until years after these first translations were made did students of the Bible become concerned with the literary forms of the rare poems, stories, dramas, orations, etc., in the succession of chapters. More recently, under the inspirational leadership of such leaders as the great English scholar, Dr. Richard Green Moulton, who gave us the Modern Reader's Bible, this Biblical literature has been lifted into the clear by being recast into forms that reveal its artistry and enhance its living messages of truth. Studied in the light of the Gospel, this literature will clarify and enrich our knowledge of the Scriptures. It will bring us closer to the inner spirit and true meaning of the Bible. Such is the intent of the lessons of this course. Plainly, it is not possible in a threeyear course of study of Bible literature, such as is being taught in Relief Society, to do much more than open up this rich field of literature. Our purpose, however, will be well served, if those who participate in this work are lured into reading the Bible with new interest and appreciation, valuing it more fully as a literary masterpiece and as the sacred record of the word of God to mankind. An even richer result will come if our mothers respond to the course by sharing its gems of literature through reading them aloud to their children. Herein is a means of sweet companionship with things divine. 'The outline of the eight study units planned for the educational year 1943-44 follows: 1. The Bible Story Concrete study of typical stories from the Bible from a literary viewpoint; their artistry as revealed in plot, characters, local color, language, music and other qualities that mark great literature. Application through story-reading and _ story-telling activities. 2. The Bible Epic Bible stories may be studied individually or in sequence. Frequently, several of these stories, taken together, portray some period of history, such as the stories of the Creation, the Deluge, the Patriarchs, the Exodus. A central purpose of this study is to present such an epic that centering in David the Warrior, King of Israel. Individual stories woven into this epic will be given added interest in light of the whole. 3. The Bible Lyric Study of Bible songs in their storysettings. An inlook into the characteristics of Biblical lyric verse. Its use in expressing heart-throbs of history and rare spiritual emotion. Application through finding and reciting or singing Biblical lyrics. 4. The Bible Ballad Comparative study of prose narrative and poetic story-telling as illustrated in Judges, Chapters IV and V depicting the story and the song of Deborah and her leadership against the enemies of Israel. Application through reading of other Bible narratives enhanced with poetic expression. 5. Bible Wisdom Study of wise sayings to be found in Proverbs and other bits of Biblical wisdom. Some of the brief Biblical essays may be added here as well as excerpts from Ecclesiastes. Application to be made through the choosing and reciting of favorite proverbs and other quotations. 6. A Bible Drama Story of the Book of Job briefly sketched. Its basic message examined. Study of the struggle of Job through testing to the divinely approved outcome. Application through finding some of the literary gems of wisdom voiced by Job in the drama. 7. Bible Oratory Study of the Farewell of Moses as depicted in Deuteronomy, with special attention to the master oration on The Blessing and the Curse its historical and spiritual implications. Application through finding the choice expressions of literature portraying the spirit and message of a great leader to a people delivered from bondage. 8. Bible Prophecy Study of some of the choice parts of Isaiah, with especial attention to the Messianic Hope, and his Rhapsody of Zion Redeemed. Application through reading selections from this "sunburst of literature," and through finding echoes of the Master Book in our own songs and anthems inspired by Isaiah.
