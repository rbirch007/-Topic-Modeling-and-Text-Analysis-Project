Steps in the Development of Our Flag The first flag of the United States, known as the Cambridge flag, was raised by George Washington at Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 2, 1776. The union was the combined crosses of St. George and St. Andrew. In August 1777, this flag was raised by Captain Abraham Swarthwout at Fort Schuyler. President Washington approved, January 13, 1794, this flag consisting of fifteen stars and stripes, Vermont and Kentucky having been admitted to the Union. In 1818, Congress enacted that the thirteen stripes, denoting the thirteen original colonies, be restored, and a star added to the blue canton for each state after its admission to the Union. The present flag consists of thirteen stripes with a blue canton bearing fortyeight stars, one for each state in the Union. Page 385
