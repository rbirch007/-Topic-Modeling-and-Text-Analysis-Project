Short-story Writing Pearl Spencer Department of English, Logan Senior High School WHEN is a short story not a short story, but a sketch, a tale, or an incident? 'This is the question which many an aspiring author ruefully asks herself as her lovingly-wrought manuscript comes back with a kindly note praising the spirit, perhaps the style, but pointing out that it doesn't quite qualify as a short story. The question is particularly difficult to answer in view of the fact that many modern writers, inspired by Chekhov and moved by an increasing interest in social conditions rather than the individual, have written memorable stories which have certainly not followed the rules laid down by Poe, and which seem to some readers not to be short stories at all. But re-examination of the great pieces of short fiction in the modern manner will show that they possess the central purpose and discernment that provide the one essential feature of the short story  unity. Assuming unity to be the necessary element of the short story, it can be seen that the followers of the Russian writers are not so much at variance with Poe's standards as many readers have thought. The difference, after all, seems chiefly one of technique, not of intent. For Poe's great purpose, you will remember, was to create a single, strong, emotional expression on his readers. He laid down the rules by which, it seemed to him, such an impression might best be made. If other methods can do the same, he would probably be the last to object. He would also agree that too many of his followers had become mechanics rather than artists, and that new ways of writing might give new life to the craft. Just as these literary mechanics, turning out vast numbers of short stories with "interchangeable parts," as one critic phrased it, discredited Poe's formula among some writers, so it is the second-rate writers, without genuine purpose or literary discipline, who have given the modern short story the reputation of being formless. As a result, many of us have the idea that we may describe our eccentric neighbor's vagaries or the desolate family camped beside the highway, and call the result a short story. The essential unity of the short story is achieved by the selection of _a struggle in which the characters of the story are engaged, and in picturing or predicting the outcome of this struggle. The struggle may be man (or woman) against the perils of intrigue, the elements, war, or enemies  and we have the adventure story; against his rivals the love story; against his material handicaps the success story; his weaknesses the moral story; the universe the religious story; his personality the psychological story; his environment  the story of social consciousness. This last, especially, has widely extended Page 389 390 the conception of what constitutes a dramatic struggle. Whatever the theme and method a writer chooses, it is his treatment of this struggle that determines the unity of his story. Its significance must be shown. It must be followed to an inevitable, clear-eyed conclusion. Accident and coincidence may hasten or precipitate the conclusion, we are told, but they must not determine it. That must be inherent in the characters and circumstances. And it is well to remember that it is not the unique situation or the dramatic denouement that brings a readerback to certain stories time and time again. It is the way in which the struggle unfolds that makes some stories immortal; that magic by which they still keep us tingling with suspense even after we know them almost by heart. This matter of resolving the conflict and getting everything ended neatly and satisfactorily is not so difficult if one chooses a struggle where the outcome is a matter of a lifetime of happiness or unhappiness, and the issues are clearly defined and capable of solution. Writing then becomes chiefly a matter of working tremendously hard to carry the reader along, in rapt attention, toward the end of the struggle, the solution of the plot. But what of the minor dramas that the sensitive participants in life see about them every day? What of those struggles whose very poignancy lies in their being unending? What of the heroism that is all the greater for being unheralded and unsung? What of those daily choices we make, no one of which is in itself of decisive importance, but which-JULY 1943 add up inevitably to our destinies? Are these not the stuff of literature also? They are indeed, and they are a rich source of material for the beginning writer, not only because we can interpret best the things we know and love, but for the very practical reason that there is a great interest in such material at the present time. If the interest is waning, as it may be, the only ones to blame are the writers who have surfeited us with formless uninterpreted, usually gloomy sketches in the name of the "new" short story. For, first of all, such material must be given form. If the nature of a man's life is to be revealed, and his never-ending, but brave struggle with poverty is to be shown, then certain incidents, complete in themselves, must be carefully chosen and highlighted. Second, the significance of these events must be made clear. It has been pointed out that the writer of a short story can't develop his characters as completely as a novelist does, but that he has to know them just as well in order to reveal them by lightning flashes, as it were. Too many writers of the "slice of life' school don't know their characters any better than any casual observer might, and reveal no more of the significance of their lives. Somerset Maugham warns us that whenever a story has no more significance than a recital of facts, the danger point has been reached. Third, the occurrences which one chooses must illumine the past and predict the future inexorably. This requirement is imposed upon the writer of this kind of story even more sternly than upon the author who SHORT-STORY WRITING creates'a more formal plot within whose outline the story has its being. The choice of incident must, in a brief space, add up in effect to a lifetime. Read Dorothy Parker's "Clothe the Naked" as an example of this kind of story. The writer of the story which does not rely upon a decisive climax and outcome, usually imposes a fourth obligation upon himself. Very often such a story becomes compelling only as it is felt to be somehow typical of large numbers of the same sort of people. Much of the reader's pleasure comes from his sense of recognition. Every writer, as Miss Edith Ronald Mirrielees points out, needs the capacity for "making the story's figures stand clear as individuals and yet cast shadows larger than the individual." 'This capacity is particularly essential in the story whose characters interest and appeal because they are typical rather than individual. PROBABLY nothing could do the cause of the pioneer story* more good than for numerous writers to turn with determination to strongly plotted stories with gripping situations, authentic personal struggles, and dramatic, triumphant climaxes. Such stories would be fit vehicles to reveal the noble, dignified, yet intensely human pioneer men and women (particularly the women), who so seldom have been adequately dealt with in the short story. Weare not obligated to show the epic significance of the entire pioneer 391 trek everytime we write of pioneer life as so many have seemed to feel. But we are obligated, whenever we write a short story of pioneer days, to produce a firm narrative with an honestly defined struggle. It should be a story that will stand on its own feet and create a response in the reader, rather than depending upon his already established responses to make it effective. 'This rather lazy dependence upon the sympathetic attitude of the reader has made too many of our pioneer stories lack appeal for "outsiders" or our own members to whom the sight of a handcart, for example, does not bring the strong emotional response that it does in most of us. No greater service could be done our young people than to provide them with stirring, genuinely moving fiction which would help create an understanding attitude toward the pioneers. Instead, much of our fiction assumes that such an admiring, understanding, and reverent attitude already exists, and the symbols of pioneer life the handcart, the _ trail-side grave will in themselves give a story emotional power. They are genuinely meaningful symbols, and our grandfathers' diaries are full of enough characters and situations, color and meaning, to provide grist for our mills for as long as Daniel Boone has done, but it's our task to give them new form, new life, and new meaning for a new generation. Because such a wealth of source material on pioneer days exists, many people have assumed that pioneer *Special instruction is given in this article on the writing of pioneer stories because a need is recognized for direction in this type of short-story writing. The General Board does not, in any way, desire to encourage the writing of pioneer stories more than other types of fiction. 392 stories should be easy to write. Writers know that they are not. A satisfactory, clearly defined struggle is hard to set up in a pioneer story, save in matters of hardships and privation; for the united struggle of the pioneers against their common protagonists always seems more characteristic than their individual struggles and problems. It is hard not to blur the unity with too much explanation. It is difficult not to intrude a moral instead of letting the characters convey their own message. We are not allowed the same range in satisfactory endings; therefore we must often work much harder to create suspense and charm in the way in which the story progresses to its conclusion. Because we are truly 'a peculiar people," we are even more false in our premises than most historical writers if we assume the plausible untruth that "people have always been the same" and interpret the pioneer sense of values accordingly. The premises upon which their sense of values were built are difficult to explain and difficult-JULY 1943 to take for granted as motivations. We have to be especially careful, as we try to appeal to the present generation, not to lose contact with the real spirit and real thinking of the pioneers. 'This requires constant, intimate, understanding contact with original source material. How impossible it is to interpret the pioneers without having imbibed deeply of their spirit and convictions is illustrated by the many scholarly and factually accurate studies which are still entirely false and valueless as interpretations of their lives. For any story of plot, Poe's formula is still the best in the world, and every writer, of course, knows his analysis by heart. Certainly no one can safely diverge from it until his sense of form is sure. Somerset Maugham sums Poe up thus: "It [the short story] is a piece of fiction, dealing with a single incident, material or spiritual, that can be read at a sitting; it is original, it must sparkle, excite, or impress, and it must have unity of effect or impression. It should move in an even line from its exposition to its close." THE STORY OF OLD GLORY (Continued from page 388) in all blazed forth upon the blue field. In December 1942 by Act of Congress, a slight change was made in the manner of presenting the pledge to the flag. In place of extending the arm, as formerly, the hand now remains over the heart during the entire time that the pledge is repeated, and is not dropped until after the final word "all."
