Relationship of the Relief Society to the Primary
By the late May Green Hinckley President of the Primary Association
THE relationship of the two organizations, the Relief Society and the Primary, is an intimate and mutual one. Their objectives are almost identical, for each centers in the home. No other organization is so helpful to the Primary Association as the organization whose membership is made up of the mothers of the Church.
The Relief Society organization has a program for helping the home builders of the Church, those whose responsibility it is to create the atmosphere and surroundings which mold the characters and fashion the lives of the boys and girls, the men and women of tomorrow. The moral progress of the world rests in a large measure in their hands.
To assist the mothers in the transcendent task of training the children is the assignment of the Primary Association. The declared objective of this association is to "teach the children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord." To establish faith in God in their hearts, to teach them respect for the laws of God and of the nation, to teach them obedience to parents and to teachers, to turn their faces to the light of Heaven, and establish their feet in the paths of righteousness are all objectives found in the great work of the Primary Association.
The program of this organization brightens the home, strengthens the hands of the parents, and makes a vital contribution to the Church by teaching the everlasting Gospel to the children during their most impressionable years.
Every Latter-day Saint mother may look to the Primary organization for specific help with the religious attitude of her children. The four and five-year-old children are taught how to pray, and are helped in their understanding of God. Those who are six years old are given opportunities to show thankfulness and appreciation for God's blessings. For the seven-year-old boys and girls, a course is planned to help them to receive worthily the greatest of all treasures membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As a natural sequence, the eight-year-old children are taught the importance of their membership in the Church and are given the precious lessons from the Master as guideposts for them to follow. The nine, ten, and eleven-year-old children are taught lessons based on the Articles of Faith and are given opportunities to evaluate the principles in their everyday lives.
In addition to the basic religious teachings, the girls are given specific training in home building, a religious character-forming, leisure-time activity program which ties directly with the principles for home life as taught in the Relief Society. The boys of the same ages are given a similar program in trail building. In each group a cooperative plan of training intro-

duces the children to arts and crafts, music, drama, games and play, nature lore and woodcraft, and many other allied arts. Every child who is helped to finish his course in Primary is well equipped with the tools for home, state, and Church citizenship.
Thus, what Relief Society members work for in the adult program, the Primary works for in the child program. Most Primary teachers are members of the Relief Society. They understand and appreciate what the Primary is doing for children.
We have not words to express our gratitude to the Relief Society for its cooperation and support. The records of the Primary will show that where the mothers are active in the Relief Society their children are active in the Primary and faithful in their Church duties.
The Primary Association will return with compound interest all the support and encouragement the parents can give to it. The Primary Association, with its 20,000 devoted teachers and officers, stands ready to help parents to teach the children of the Church lessons that will serve them throughout their lives.
Every effort should be made to have the Primary program fortify the home and reinforce the lessons which Relief Society mothers are teaching in all Latter-day Saint homes. Every effort should be made to strengthen the ties that bind the Primary to the Relief Society.
