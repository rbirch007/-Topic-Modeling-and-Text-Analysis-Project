to our fathers on the third Sunday in June. Happy the child, the youth, and the man or woman to whom the word "father" recalls a series of recollections brimming with the loving care and kindness bestowed upon him by his father. To such a person, memory reaches back to earliest years and treasured childhood experiences. These will vary, but how often, perchance, will one of these incidents be centered about the bedside of the sick, as the family kneels in prayer and the father, exercising one of his greatest prerogatives as the bearer of the Holy Priesthood, invokes the healing power upon the sick. Mingled with such important and sacred memories will be ones of a lighter nature, ones in which the father figures as a veritable mine crammed full of pennies and nickels, a haven of last resort in crucial times of need. A trip taken with a father always remains a bright and cherished mem-  W ordsworth. Ory. It may have been to a large city where it seemed that all the alluring and enchanting sights and sounds in the world were spread out before one's wondering gaze. One such trip to New York is recalled. Each morning one was awakened by father standing in the doorway of the hotel bedroom and quoting, "The bird of time has but a little way to fly and lo, the bird is on the wing." This reminder of the fast fleeting magic days worked as a charm! Associated with that special trip are recollections of a visit to the lower east side in order that a wholesome home might the better be appreciated; the wonders of the Hippodrome where the horses disappeared under the water; the magic of the Automat where one put in a nickel and food appeared in as wonderful a manner as any fairy tale; luncheon at the Astor with Hazel Dawn; and two trips to the Metropolitan to watch with fascinated eyes the dancing of Nijinski and the Russian Ballet. Golden pages from the book of memory of a father's kindness and generosity! Another happy recollection of a holiday spent with father is of a mountain camping trip which remains a vivid picture for two reasons: first, for the discovery that father was a good cook; and second, a not-so-pleasant Poge 397 remembrance of flesh gained from eating his skillet-bread. As one grows older, one more and more becomes conscious of the watchful and constant care evidenced by a father as the guardian of his children. Pitfalls and dangers are pointed out and all one's friends and associates are closely scrutinized. One feels at times that his premonitions and insight are too acute to be comfortable, but gradually as one's outlook broadens, his wisdom is recognized and his advice is followed with a better grace. His justice and fairness stand out as prominent traits, and his encouragement and understanding are ever sources of strength. One comes to turn to him more and more for counsel and in following it, one's life takes on a righteous pattern. After marriage, when one's husband becomes the father of one's children, then the cycle is completed. In noting the tender, constant, and great love manifested by a young father toward his babies and young children, one's appreciation for fatherhood is increased, and thanksgiving to the Lord wells up in one's heart for fathers such as these fathers who will be our fathers not only here but throughout time and all eternity as well.
