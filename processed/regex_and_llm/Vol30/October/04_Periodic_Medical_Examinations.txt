Periodic Medical Examinations of Apparently Healthy Persons
H. L. Marshall, M. D. Professor of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Medical School, University of Utah
HUMAN nature is characterized by many inconsistencies. One of them is the chasm which so often separates knowledge from actionknowing what should be done from actually doing it. Particularly is this often true in the management of our own human mechanism. Fears, prejudices, and indifference are usually stronger than knowledge. It is easier to follow one's feelings than one's reason.
Twenty years ago a member of the Public Relations Committee of the Pennsylvania Medical Society wrote, "The proposal that healthy people be examined at regular intervals for the purpose of preventing disease is notable for the logic of its theory and the slowness of its adoption."
In China it is said to have been a custom for clients to pay a physician regularly for keeping them well, but to stop payment and demand free treatment if the client became sick. In our Anglo-Saxon background the good old English Doctor Dobell suggested, in 1861, that much good could be accomplished and much harm prevented if physicians would carefully examine their patients before, instead of exclusively after, the symptoms of disease appeared.
In America, the most sustained attempt to popularize the practice of periodic medical examinations has been that of the organization known as the
Page 594
Life Extension Institute. Life insurance companies have been strong supporters of the practice, and some have used it on a large scale. The Army has adopted the practice of yearly examination of all officers, and schools are acting on the idea to an increasing extent. But, for adults in general, practice lags far behind conviction. Therefore, it is worth-while to consider the matter objectively. Mere persuasion offends the intelligence.
The human body, considered mechanistically, is an energy-liberating machine. It displays growth, development, and degeneration. It is subject to unfavorable changes of structure and function which lead to disability, pain, and death. These changes we call disease. Except in case of accident or violence, basic changes almost never develop suddenly. They are progressive and, for a considerable time, they usually produce no symptoms of which the person is aware.
Let us assume that a yardstick divided into thirty-six inches represents the whole process of a chronic (i.e. slow) disease. The left end of the rule marks the very first beginning of the morbid process; the right end marks the termination. Rarely does progress over the first few inches give any symptoms at all. Frequently, two-thirds of the distance may be covered with no symptoms definitely recognized by PERIODIC MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OF APPARENTLY HEALTHY PERSONS the victim. Pain and disturbance of function are often confined to the last few inches. Too often medical contacts center entirely in the last inch. Inferences to be drawn from such knowledge are self-evident and perhaps would not be seriously debatable except at a convention of morons. The logic applies almost equally to a Ford car; however, the difference is that we can get new organs for a Ford when the originals are completely "shot," and, sometimes, we can even turn in the whole flivver on a new car. There are no turn-ins for the human mechanism and very few chances for either new or reconditioned parts. We make the run of life with one machine. It is the only one we have, and no one yet appears to have completed arrangements for another. If this were true of the Ford, how watchful we would be. How often would we have an expert examine itand how careful we would be to take his advice. The teeth represent one of the few "turn-ins for a new set" possible in the human body. And yet strangely enough, this is one of the few places where we are nearly all converted to the idea of regular examination before symptoms appear. Stranger still, perhaps, many of us actually live up to the idea in practice. If the process of disease we harbor is not contagious, then the matter is primarily a personal one. At least no one else is definitely endangered. But the process may be communicable (i.e., caused by living organisms which can be transferred from the ailing to the well); for example, tuberculosis and some stages of syphilis 595 . In that case, earliest possible recognition is comparable to detecting a concealed weapon on a gangster before it causes irreparable harm to him and also to his contacts. Obviously, reason and interpretation point to the desirability of careful medical examination of apparently healthy people. Is it possible, we may ask, to substantiate such reasoning by actual accomplishment? Without question it is; although all disease processes cannot yet be recognized in their early stages, and it must be clearly understood that some unforeseen deaths cannot be predicted by any present means at the disposal of medicine. To be specific let us start with the babyeven before it is born. Here the beneficial results of regular medical examination throughout pregnancy are so vitalboth to mother and childthat mere mention of the point is sufficient. Thousands of lives are thereby saved yearly. As for the period of babyhood, the practice of pediatrics (i.e., child specialists) has grown up around -the idea of medical care to prevent rather than exclusively to cure sickness. Formerly the luxury of medical guidance to keep a baby well was practiced only by the rich. Increasingly, it is becoming a routine to people of moderate means, and now in larger centers "well baby clinics" serve the poor at nominal cost and the destitute at public expense. In Utah fifty years ago the annual infant mortality rate ranged around 200. This means that one out of every five babies born alive died before reaching its first birthday. Now the infant mortality rate runs 30 to 40. (Continued on page 614) An Appeal to Mothers Bishop Marvin O. Ashton Member of the Presiding Bishopric AN Appeal to You Mothers: As we contemplate the progress this Church is making in its buildings and their upkeep, we are very mindful of the major part you mothers are playing. Yes, in some locallities you are playing the leading role. When you set your mind on a project, things begin to move. If they don't move, you move them. When the United States was at war with Mexico and the Latter-day Saints were asked to raise a battalion, it is reported that Brigham Young said, "You shall have your battalion, and if there are not young men enough, we will take the old men, and if they are not enough, we will take the women.' Of course, the women didn't have to enlist, but in some of our programs of repairs to our mecting houses, our women do enlist. Women of the Relief Society, we want your help. We want you to insist that your place of worship be kept clean and attractive. We want you to demand of your stake and ward authorities that the buildings and all their facilities be kept just as up to date and clean as your kitchens. Mothers, the buildings where your children worship and where they get religious instruction, and where they are offered recreational opportunities, should be well furnished and up to date. While we appreciate that this is the condition of most of our chapels, there are still some dark corners in some of them that must be cleaned up. If Page 596 you mothers will insist on a clean-up, there will be one. We appeal to you. Expect it and you will get it. The bishop will appreciate your suggestions. 'Tell him what you want, and he will respect your wishes. Sentiment and public opinion are powerful. Here are a few things the mothers of the Church have a right to demand: Custodian _ There should be close cooperation and a feeling of harmony between the custodian and the people of the ward. The custodian should know what the different organizations in the ward require and should cater to their needs, but he has a right to expect proper support from the people. Mothers can help greatly in this respect. Paint It should be understood that tor years the Church has offered to buy the paint if the ward will put it on. No matter how humble a chapel may be, it should be kept well painted inside and out. Landscaping You mothers have a nght to cxpect ward grounds to be well landscaped, where water is available. If water is not availablethese cases are comparatively fewyou have a right to expect that weeds be kept down and dried: grass and debris cleared off. The general appearance of your building should say, "Come AN APPEAL TO MOTHERS 597 AS WITH THE CHURCH, SO WITH THE PEOPLE Is this just a dream?? In." It should appeal and not repel. May we say here very emphatically many Church buildings that now sit on a dry. Sand hill could be made a little garden spot if just a little ingenuity were used to bring water to the spot either by pipes or irrigation ditch. Generally, where there is a will there is a way. Furniture Mothers, if clumsy, roughly hewn benches and furniture are used in your chapel, you ought to sign a Declaration of Independence and have a Boston Tea Party. When the pioneers arrived, they had to do the best they could with what they had, but in these days you have a night to demand that the furniture represent your better selves. Rest Rooms Now we come to a matter in which we want your help in a special way. To be frank, many of these rooms even in our more expensive buildings area disgrace. Some of them show extreme neglect and even abuse. (Continued on page 619) She Is Ours Edith S. Elliott Member of Relief Society General Board DOROTHY C. THORPE beautiful glassware exhibited in the most exclusive stores and shops throughout the nation bearing the trade name of Dorothy C. Thorpe. The better magazines advertise her wares. Newspapers and periodicals quite frequently carty news items of her fascinating art. People of wealth and influence clamor for her work, often requesting her to create special articles for them. One might ask, "In what particular field of art does she specialize?" The answer is overwhelming! Besides the glassware mentioned above, she designs and manufactures exquisite articles in linens, cottons, Page 598 MANY of us have admired the metals, laces, and plastics, as well as creating dainty figurines. She designs, decorates, and furnishes to the last detail an individual room or all rooms in private residences. Her boudoirs are of delicate, exquisite beauty. The nurseries that she has done delight children and are a never-ending source of pleasure to adults. When we view the products of her hands we naturally wonder about the artist herself. She was born in a Latter-day Saint home in Salt Lake City. Her parents, George Eustace and Louise Ridges Carpenter, encouraged Dorothy and provided the opportunity for development of her talents in her youth. Some may not know that this parenthood gave to Dorothy a rich heritage. Her father, born in London, was the youngest son of a wealthy Church of England clergyman, Joseph Hatton Carpenter. He enjoyed all of the advantages of a cultured, well-ordered English home. He and his brothers and sisters were given unusually good educations to fit them for the various professions to which they seemed best adapted. Just as the boys were reaching manhood, their father died, leaving an estate to be divided. The oldest brother, Joseph, took his share of the estate and decided that before settling down he would take a trip around the world. He visited the continents of Europe and Africa, sailed up the east coast of Africa, traveling on to the cities of Asia SHE IS OURS 599 GLASS TRAY WITH PLASTIC HANDLES, AND GLASS VASE, DESIGNED BY MRS. THORPE and Australia. From these cities he continued on to South America, and thence to New York City. While there, he met some Latter-day Saints and missionaries en route to Utah from his native homeland. Delighted to see some of his own countrymen and interested in their story of the Prophet Joseph Smith, he decided to accompany the Saints to the Salt Lake Valley and learn more about them and their teachings. Having been raised in a religious home, Joseph was receptive to the Gospel message and was baptized a worthy member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Anxious to share his new-found joy, he wrote to his widowed mother to tell her of his good fortune. She was shocked and grieved over the news. Her first thought was that Joseph had lost his mind, and she immediately set about to do something to rectify his condition. Joseph's brother, George, in the meantime, had decided to take his share of the family fortune and see the world also. When he reached South Africa, he became interested in the beauty and grace of the feathers of the ostrich. At that particular time ostrich plumes were "highfashioned." The selling of them was extremely lucrative, so George purchased an ostrich farm and settled down to his new and fascinating venture. Business was good, and he prospered financially. Eventually, however, he received a letter from his heartbroken mother telling of his brother Joseph's sad fate. She plead with George to bring him home to London where he could be properly hospitalized. George sold his farm and set sail for the United States. Upon his arrival in Salt Lake City, he found Joseph happy and in the best of 600: health. (At the present time he is serving as recorder of the Manti Temple.) The younger Carpenter rejoiced to find his brother perfectly normal and inquired as to the reason of his mother's anxiety. Joseph and his friends explained the Gospel to George, who readily accepted the message and applied for baptism. Imagine Mrs. Carpenter's concern when she learned that her youngest son, so dear to her heart, had likewise joined this unpopular group! George made friends quickly, and was a general favorite among the young people. While living at the home of Parley P. Pratt, he became acquainted with Brother Pratt's granddaughter, Louise Ridges. She was a beautiful and accomplished gitl, Young Carpenter, in due time, fell in love with Louise and made her his bride. Louise Ridges Carpenter also has an interesting background. Besides being the granddaughter of Parley P. Pratt, whose gifts and talents are familiar to Latter-day Saints, she was also the daughter of Joseph P. Ridges, formerly of England and Australia, who built the original Tabernacle organ. She could tell man interesting tales of the building of that great organ and laughingly claimed a hand in its completion. Her mother, Agatha Pratt Ridges, made the glue that was used to fit the organ pipes together. She followed a recipe furnished by her husband, the main ingredients of which were horse and cow hoofs. The glue had to simmer and stew for quite a long period on the back of the Ridges' stove, and the smell was extremely offensive; but because they couldn't make the glue without the odor, the Ridges family accepted the ordeal and kept the pot constantly hot. The glue had to be carried to the Tabernacle hot or it wouldn't stick properly. It was the duty of little Louise to make many trips to the Tabernacle to deliver the hot glue to her father. Every time she took him his lunch pail, a bucket of glue accompanied it. George and Louise were a happy young couple. 'The young Mrs. Carpenter made a charming home for them. She was artistic, intelligent, resourceful, and energeticall qualities that make for ideal home management. Soon after the birth of their first child, a daughter Florence, George Carpenter was called on a mission to England. After making plans for the care of his lovely wife and daughter during his absence, he left for his homeland. With gratitude in his heart that his call was to England, he eagerly looked forward to receiving a warm welcome at his mother's home. He was overjoyed at the thought of teaching the Gospel in person to his family and friends. Naturally, his first call was at his mother's home. The door was closed against him. His mother later consented to meet him in a secluded section of a public park. She arrived in her elegant carriage with the shades drawn so that no one would recognize her. She admitted George to the carriage and ordered it driven along unfrequented lanes. She told him that he had humiliated and disgraced his family by joining the Mormon Church, and plead with him to renounce his membership. She begged him to desert his wife and baby, give up proselyting, and to SHE lS OURS stay in England among his kin. But George was true to his convictions. Despite the tug of family ties and temptations, he finished his mission, was honorably released, and returned to Zion. George was a gifted writer. He was city editor of the Deseret News for a number of years, and wrote for several magazines and periodicals under the nom de plume of "Jack Plane." As the motion picture industry developed, Mr. Carpenter became interested in the film exchange business which later led him into the management of the Paramount Theater in Salt Lake City, which position he held until shortly before his death. One may wonder what the above recital has to do with the story of Dorothy C. Thorpe. It merely acquaints one with the kind of ancestry from which she comes. The cultured, refined, educated, talented blood of the Carpenters and the Ridges, plus the hardy, intelligent, gifted qualities of the pioneer Pratt family, have produced a genius like Dorothy. She has been aware of her talents and has never "hidden them under a bushel." DOROTHY is the second child in a family of five children. When very young her parents noted that she was artistic and creative. She loved music, rhythm, color, and graceful lines. She liked to sew for her dolls, and she displayed unusual skill for a child. When only twelve years old, she designed and made a complete wardrobe for her doll which took eight first prizes in the Utah State Fair. Every year from then on she entered lovely bits of 601 DECORATIVE PIECE BY MRS. THORPE her handiwork in the Fair. Without exception each entry won a blue ribbon. Along with her creative ability and flare for design, she studied piano under the master teacher John J. McClellan. She loved melody, thythm, harmony, piano technique. She was an outstanding pupil and became an excellent concert pianist. Part of her musical education was under Professor Syler of Los Angeles. Along with the artistic hobbies that she followed, she found plenty of time to attend to her Church duties. She gave generously of her musical talent in accompaniment and piano solos. At the old L. D. S. High School, Dorothy Carpenter was an outstanding student scholastically as well as in her art classes. When Dorothy became too old to sew for dolls she transferred her interest in sewing for them to sewing 602 COMPLETE TABLE ENSEMBLE DESIGNED BY DOROTHY THORPE for her little sister Afton, who is now the wife of Bishop Frank Armstrong of Cottonwood Ward. Afton was like a beautiful dream child. She had naturally curly golden-blonde hair, big blue eyes, and fair smooth skin. Since nature had been so kind to her, Dorothy made it her pleasure to see that her clothing matched her beauty. Without being extravagant, she made exquisite lingerie for Afton. She scalloped the necks and ruffles of her little slips, and added touches of lace or ribbon in just the right places. The dresses, whether for play or best, were meticulously made and clever in design. She enjoyed visits to her sister Florence's home in Los Angeles, where she met and later married George A. Thorpe, a widower with a small son, Kelly. She won the love and affection of the little boy as well as his father. When her own son, Dick, was born, she expressed gratitude that he had such a fine big brother. Life moved on smoothly for the Thorpes. Mr. Thorpe had a splendid stock and bond business, with an income sufficient to make living interesting and progressive. It probably would have remained so had not the depression years undermined George's business. The family budget had to be trimmed many times until George's anxiety fostered a desire. In Dorothy to see if she could help. Naturally, she turned to her art and craft hobbies. She wrapped drinking glasses with bright colored raffia, shellacked the wrappings and achieved attractive beverage glasses. 'These she timidly took to a buyer in one of the Los Angeles department stores to see if she could interest him in selling such articles in his store. The buyer recognized a good saleable article and gave her an order. The glasses were popular, and the demand increased so rapidly that she had to get help from other members of her family living near by. This one idea led to others. She numbered glasses, monogrammed them, banded them with sterling silver. Each new creation met with immediate success until the business spread from the house into the garage, and finally to a factory. She added variety to her stock. Individual special orders began pouring in asking for complete dinner or luncheon sets. Ofttimes the table linen on hand didn't seem appropriate for the setting of the dishes, so she called into use her knowledge of needlework and made dinner and luncheon cloths and napkins to harmonize with the dishes. Orders became so numerous that SHE IS OURS she soon had to enlarge her factory personnel beyond the members of her immediate family. Since then she has gathered into her business Old and New World artisans whose loyalty to her can only be explained by really knowing Mrs. Thorpe. She is modest and unassuming and is willing to share her success with every member of her company. She is appreciative of their efforts and ability. Many of these persons she has trained herself, and she gets a personal pleasure from their achievements. ON E of the outstanding characteristics of Mrs. Thorpe is her spirituality. She has expressed on many occasions that she has had help and inspiration from her Heavenly Father, and feels His nearness in helping to solve problems that naturally appear in any modern business. She writes, "There have been so many proofs of God's care and nearness in our work. How else were all these wonderful peopleour co-workers put in contact with us? There is our talented Mexican boy sand carver; Charlotte, the charming little French girl, whom I had never seen until she approached me one day in a large Los Angeles department store. Her magic fingers execute miracles of beauty in needlework. She and her family make all of our table linens, lamp shades, draperies, bedspreads, and occasional items. 'Then there is Mr. Ardron, a genius with plastics who knew absolutely nothing about the material until he worked out the first few pieces for us. He has now made such a study of plastics that I feel he leads the profession in his type of work. Also, there is the German ceramic artist who paints designs on glass and china with such 603 LAMP BASE AND SHADE DESIGNED BY DOROTHY THORPE perfection. 'There are lovely girls in the retail shop, from Bernice, the little colored stock girl, to Ann, the gracious manager, who every day is making new-friends for all of us due to her fineness and sincerity. The factory and office workers give 100 per cent efficiency and loyalty. So much credit goes to my beloved stepson, Kelly, who is now in Africa serving his country. For the past few years he has been traveling from one end of the country to the other as the factory representative, as did also my young brother Guy. Why, about a year ago before there were many shortages and lack of workers, did Miss Milba Lloyd, the capable English sculptress, come into my office and make such a fair proposition that it was possible to employ her? I am sure it was again the guiding hand of our Father in Heaven." Mrs. Thorpe constantly expresses appreciation for her husband who has caught the spirit of her work and encourages her and delights in her success. He carries all the business and financial responsibilities, leaving Dorothy free to revel in her creative efforts. His kindness, consideration, and understanding enable them to work closely together. Dorothy is lovely in appearance. She is tall with dark hair and eyes and is fastidious in dress. There is a friendliness about her that puts even strangers at ease. She is quick to recognize ability in others and is willing to lend a helping hand. Some few years ago she had a friend who designed and manufactured children's clothes. This friend was anxious to get her merchandise on the Los Angeles market. She wrote to Mrs. Thorpe to ask her if, without any embarrassment or inconvenience, she could introduce her to the buyer in the children's department of the most exclusive department store in Los Angeles where Mrs. Thorpe's fine handwork was retailed. A letter came back via air mail saying, "Call me as soon as you arrive in Los Angeles, and I will be happy to make the appointment for you and help in any way I can." In the same letter she expressed joy in knowing of the friend's plans. She told how thrilling it was to her to encourage someone beginning in the creative field. "Because," she continued, "my work hasn't been all smooth sailing and without the help of friends and the Great Creator Himself, I wouldn't have attained such success. Then, too, I feel that anyone who can create in a small way, has something akin to that Great Creator." Just before the present world war Mrs. Thorpe went on a business trip to Europe. She hoped to gain inspiration and new ideas from Old World treasures. She also hoped to establish a European business whereby she could have beautiful, finished articles made by Old World craftsmen according to her designs, shipped to her Los Angeles office, bearing the label "Made in (name of country) exclusively for Dorothy C. Thorpe." Being internationally known, her trip was made easy and interesting by European dealers and producers, as well as by connoisseurs of her art. Unfortunately, the war intervened and her venture had to be postponed until some future date. Not discouraged by the turn of affairs, she returned home sparkling with new ideas that could be realized in her own country. Mrs. Thorpe works out special orders for such well-known people as Ginger Rogers, Laraine Day, William Powell, Andy, of Amos and Andy fame, Clark Gable, the Duchess of Windsor, Leopold Stokowski, and many others. She is listed in Who's Who in American Art. She enjoys the friendship and esteem of fellow artisans. One of her greatest personal joys has been in the achievement of her two brothers. Both have been motion picture set designers. Guy left the business to act as an able factory representative for his sister. Claude has remained at R. K. O. where he is first assistant set decorator. Dorothy's love and interest in her sister Afton is a loving example of affection. She is proud of Afton's beautiful home in Cottonwood. Afton is also blessed with artistic talents.

Throughout her home are evidences of her fine needlework in linens, curtains, draperies, hooked rugs, etc. Also the color combinations of her home are restful and appropriate. When Mrs. Thorpe was asked for pictures to accompany this article, she wrote, "In my opinion the Latter-day Saint Relief Society is one of the world's outstanding organizations, and we will be very proud indeed to have your Magazine publish an article on our work." This brief biography about one so worthy of recognition has been a pleasure to prepare. Dorothy Thorpe has risen high in her field, and we are proud that she is ours.
