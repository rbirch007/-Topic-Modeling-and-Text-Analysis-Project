Madame Chiang Kai-shek Ramona W. Cannon
MADAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK, America's recent guest who won the nation's heart, will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the great women of all time. So many qualities are merged into resultant greatness that analysis is difficult, yet in Madame Chiang's case perhaps one of the most important elements is her power of blending and harmonizing. She has taken the best of the wonderful Oriental culture of antiquity and the best of the modern Western culture and blended them into a workable philosophy of life. She has used the wisdom of the old proverbs as motivation for quick action in the life of today. She has harmonized elements that seem incongruous into a smooth, sane pattern of living. For example, although the world regards her as a leading feminist, yet the Chinese people think of her and her two sisters as "pearls among women" because they are "husband-helpers," and "how could praise go higher?" Again, Madame Chiang has a deep faith in God, yet she believes that truest inspiration comes by exerting also her own mind to its fullest capabilities, and letting the All-wise work through and upon her own best intelligence. A brief sketch of the background of the Soongs is necessary to understand the work of Mayling, wife of China's Generalissimo. Destiny must have had a hand in the birth of the children. According to the delightful book, The Soong Sisters, by Emily Hahn, destiny made a twofold contribution. First, both parents were Christians; also, both parents were extraordinarily progressive, forward-looking, and fearless. If either one had been of the conservative type and had held the other back, the Soong sisters whom we know would not have emerged, and China would be a different country today. Mrs. Soong was a descendant of the illustrious Wen Ting-kung, who, eighteen generations ago, became one of the first Chinese Christians. He established the tradition, which was maintained throughout succeeding generations, that children should be treated alike, regardless of sex. (In Wen's time girl babies were not infrequently cast into the rivers.) Mrs. Soong herself received an excellent education. She bore six children, and had a talent for administration in the home and in business. She helped her husband, who was working day and night to further the Revolution under Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and she gave to the poor, and was a patron of schools and churches. Through her good management, the family lived in happiness and comfort, even though she was a stern disciplinarian. Mr. Soong, the father, was sent by his parents to Boston at the age of nine, to help his uncle, a shopkeeper, in a Chinese store. For three years the little boy stood behind a counter, went to night school, and longed for a first-class education. Then he stowed away on a cutter bound for the South. The captain, Charles Jones, befriended and con-

verted him to Christianity. The boy was christened Charles Jones Soong. After five years of preparatory and college work, he returned to Shanghai as a missionary teacher. Gradually, however, he drifted into industry, and married.
THE three sons, T. V., T. L., and T. A. Soong, are among China's most outstanding men today. The three daughters are named Eling (Loving Years), Chingling (Happy Years), and Mayling (Beautiful Years). Some prefer the translation "youth" to "years." At home, the little girls learned to do fine needlework, and to cook Chinese and American fashion. They learned English at Miss Richardson's Methodist school. The school was very advanced for five-year-old Mayling, and she would wake up at nights in fits of trembling. Standing straight on the floor, she would repeat her lessons. Wisely, she was taken home, where she worked with a tutor until she left for America at the age of nine. The three sisters went abroad before their brothers did. Eling was the first to go, and Shanghai received a fresh shock at the behavior of Charlie Soong's family. The idea of a father's spending on a girl all that money that ought to go into her dowry! And then the girl would come home with dangerous, newfangled ideas. Two good reasons why no man would ever want to marry her. The sisters, however, were very happy in the Wesleyan College for Women, in Macon, Georgia. They acquired charming voices and accents, and made many good friends among American students. Their parents sent them bolts of exquisite Chinese silks, which were the envy of the school. Mayling, too young for regular work, was permitted to live on the campus and have special work. She was pert and had a quick wit, and a quick temper. In 1913, Mayling enrolled in Wellesley College, where she majored in English literature, minored in philosophy, and studied science and music. She was chosen a "Durant Scholar," the highest academic distinction the college awarded. When Mayling returned to Shanghai, she had a struggle to adjust herself. With a tutor, she studied the intricacies of Chinese language and literature. She broke precedents as Eling had done, who, after marrying the wealthy Dr. Kung, actually appeared in her husband's Christian school for men and taught the classes herself, when the American teacher failed to arrive. Mayling did social work with the Y. W. C. A., and became a member of the National Film Censorship Committee, and of the Child Labor Commission. She was shocked at the labor conditions in factories. Chingling married Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who was a frequent visitor in the home of Charlie Soong. She went through the trials and dangers of the Revolution with him. One of his chief supporters was Chiang Kai-shek, who, divorced, fell in love with Mayling. He waited ten years for her and, in the meantime, studied Christianity, principally through Mrs. Soong. Two years after his marriage he was baptized. Mayling went with the Generalissimo to live in Nanking, with its squalor and emptiness. Other officers' wives re-

mained in Shanghai, but Mayling went to work with her husband. She started schools for children of the Revolution, and saw that they were taught to use their hands and their bodies, and to reason why things should be done. They learned to use their initiative instead of depending on regimentation. Madame Chiang found that the officers waiting in Nanking for orders were restive. They had nothing to do. So she gathered help and organized the Officers' Moral Endeavor Association, which cultivated art, music, drama, and sociability. The Association supplied posters for propaganda, scenery for plays, and decorations for public buildings. The Generalissimo was struggling for the unification of China under a constitutional government. He had separated from Sun Yat-sen and his communistic regime. Chiang wanted social changes, but of a milder form. Although the three sisters were married to men representing three opposing schools of thoughtDr. Sun, the communistic, Dr. Kung, the capitalistic, and the Generalissimo, the liberalfamily loyalty was so strong that their friendship remained firm. All were working, too, in their own ways, for the betterment of China. Wherever her husband went on his campaigns, Mayling accompanied him, living in icy cold shacks with no comforts, but always carrying curtains and flower bowls, and personally scrubbing floors and tables. She was fighting a revolution against dirt and sloth, and the idea that upper-class Chinese women "lose face" if they use a dustcloth or a broom.

Another project of Madame Chiang's was to promote, by speeches and otherwise, her husband's New Life Movement, based upon propriety, justice, integrity, and conscientiousness. Spiritual reform is its aim. One must discriminate clearly between what is his own and what is not his own, and must not take what does not belong to him. Degrading the personality by stealing, matters much; dying of hunger is not important. The movement aims at modesty and economy in dress, cleanliness, moderation, and the improvement of table manners. Accompanying her husband on tours through China's Northwest and West, Mayling addressed the leading women everywhere, begging that they sense social responsibility and cooperate in fighting the menaces of dirt, poverty, disease, and particularly opium. As leaders, she appointed the wives of leading officials. She told the school girls that the uneducated did not know how to organize; that when they met, they chattered about everything except the subject in hand and that the educated had a great responsibility to learn to teach and to organize. When her husband was kidnapped by his opponents, Madame Chiang, against advice, flew to him, and was admitted to his cell. He was troubled, humiliated, and suffering from injuries. She read the Psalms to him until he fell into a much needed slumber.
No sooner had Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek attained success in uniting China, than the Japanese began their undeclared war. Madame Chiang's task now became

herculean. All three Soong sisters worked unitedly and individually to save China, giving both of their talents and private means. Mayling helped Eling (Madame Kung) with the establishment and direction of mobile industrial cooperatives, using light machinery for quick evacuation. Eling hoped the cooperative system might be the answer to the struggle between capital and labor. The sisters also gave themselves to the raising of funds and the swift organizing of hospitals and war orphanages for the many, many thousands of wounded and bereft. Madame Chiang established a training school for select young women. Conditions were very sanitarydishes were passed through three rinse waters. The girls were to teach in other training schools whose students would teach the peasant women better methods of farming, prevention of disease, and also the three "R's." Madame Chiang herself talked to the girls daily; her intensity fired one of the most sheltered groups of young women in the world with the zeal to change themselves into what Madame wished them to become. Mayling Chiang was Secretary General of the Aeronautic Commission. She started her aviators from the field, watched the fighting from the hills, and welcomed those who came back. Overcrowded, however, with duties, she eventually gave this up. Madame Chiang's mind is sharp and clean-cutting as a razor. Her scholarship is amazing. Her large, accurate vocabulary is enough to send most American women scurrying to the dictionary; yet, when she addresses children, her style is simple and graphic. Years ago she told America that Japan would bring war to her doorstep. Before the Canadian Parliament, she traced minutely the growth of Anglo-Saxon institutions, and contrasted parliamentary government with axis tyranny. In her Wellesley speech of 1942 she followed the growth of feminism throughout the world, and showed that women "have had a share in the ever-ascending pyramid of civilization." Again she stressed the obligation of the educated and able to minister to humanity. High thinking, translated into deeds which bring about human progress, is what differentiates men from beasts, she commented, pointing out also that the group accomplishes far more than the individual. Humility, also, she laudedthe insistent desire to learn from all sources. Herein she divulged secrets of her own successputting her vast knowledge to practical useskillfully organizing groups, carefully teaching them, and always learning more herself. Madame Chiang has given away another secretthe source of her power to inspire. It lies in her confession of faith. At home her mother has prayed for her children"not a five-minute prayer to bless her child and grant her request. It meant 'waiting upon God until she felt His leading." After her mother's death, Mayling had to pray herself through things. She needed a source of strength greater than her own. "When I talk with God, He lifts me up where I can see clearly." God is always there, accessible, but one must strive for the presence of God
