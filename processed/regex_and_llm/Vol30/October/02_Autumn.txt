AUTUMN Edna S. Dustin
The frost is busy retracing the earth With his brilliant colored spray. He has dressed all the trees by the bend in the road In Armenian colors gay.
The trees form in line like a long caravan, The burning wild grass shifts the scenes, And the colored leaves as they gracefully sway Are dancing gypsies, with tambourines.
