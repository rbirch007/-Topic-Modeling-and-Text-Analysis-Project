Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon
IN Latin American countries many women of old aristocratic families are emerging from the seclusion of home and church to become pioneers in the advanced social changes sweeping the nations. Also, the large middle class developing from increased industry is helping to build a new civilization with unforeseen opportunities for the masses. Education has become compulsory in most of the countries. Some years ago, women above the very poor classes felt that housework was degrading. Today, Puerto Rico has an excellent modern school of domestic science. The Nicaraguans have erected a statue to Mrs. Josefa de Aguirre, a beloved educator of girls and an author. The vacation colonies and nursery schools of Peru were instituted by the wife of a former president.
MRS. BURTON W. MUSSER of Salt Lake City, a United States delegate to two Pan-American conferences, says that the favorite accomplishment of a woman mayor in Chile is a housing project for workers, and a community restaurant where undernourished children are fed daily, and where workers obtain a noon-time meal at cost. She notes that the outstanding welfare projects of Argentina are under the administration of a woman, and that in Uruguay a woman physician stands at the head of all the child-welfare program, which includes education as well as health and other phases of child-welfare work. The wife of President Lopez of Columbia worked successfully for ideal institutional care for 1800 orphans and underprivileged children.
THE women of the little Dominican Republic voted in the presidential election of 1942; and in Cuba, Brazil, El Salvador, and Uruguay complete woman suffrage is enjoyed.
IN the fields of medicine, law, art, sculpture, and literature women are proving very successful. The Chilean poet, Gabriela Mistral, who writes on many subjects other than "love remembered or desired" has won international recognition. Dr. Bertha Lutz of Brazil is an authentic scientist as well as an internationally known feminist. Many thousands of our good neighbor women are engaged in various types of Red Cross and war work. With all these new activities, the women of Latin America still retain their graciousness and charm.
UNION of the Women of the Americas now exists. One aim of the organization is to detect and eradicate enemy influence in the various countries. The Union's emblem represents the American continent with no dividing lines. The inscription reads: "All America united for victory."
