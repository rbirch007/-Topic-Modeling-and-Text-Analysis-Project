The Landing of Columbus on San Salvador" by Vanderlyn, is used as the frontispiece of this Magazine. The New World will celebrate, on October 12, the 451 anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus. The following quotation from the Book of Mormon tells of a man who "went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land":
And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land.
The Prophet Joseph Smith once compared himself to Columbus when he said: "I break the ground; I lead the way like Columbus...."

"THE TEMPLE WALL" T. J. Howells, M. D.
Surrounding the Temple grounds in Salt Lake City and a very important part of the landscape is a tall massive structure known as the "Temple Wall." The building of the wall, begun as a make-work project in the fall of 1852, was completed five years later. The architect of the wall was Truman O. Angell. The structure gives an appearance of strength, solidity, and utility, all of which is characteristic of early pioneer building. Not only does the wall enclose various edifices dear to the hearts of Latter-day Saints, including the Salt Lake Temple, the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, but it encloses the block from which the streets in Salt Lake City radiate and the principal ones receive their names. The wall is artistic and forms a beautiful background for flowers which bloom in rich profusion within the grounds of Temple Square.
