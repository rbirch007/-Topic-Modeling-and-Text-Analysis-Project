The Gracious Years Kathleen B. Nelson
RHEA CALVERT'S home was charming. Each detail of her spacious living room had been chosen with a careful discernment. Rhea, herself, was charming too in her wayher hair smartly styled and the pale linen dress she wore exactly suitable for that particular hour at home. Rhea had given all of her mature life to acquiring a background of cultured ease. Her husband had made money and she had made use of it. Now widowed for several years, she gave all of her time to her particular social set. Not until recently had she entertained even a vague doubt that hers was not an important contribution to the world's well-being. And now this doubt was driving her to an almost frenzied justification of her way of life.
Today she had two callers, but they were not enjoying themselves. In spite of the comfortable cool room and the dainty food on the coffee table, they sat on the edge of their chairs as though poised for a chance to break away. Rhea's monologue like a fast-revolving door kept them fixed. Her voice had caught in a fretful groove and was spinning on in a long recital of grievances suffered from the butcher, the baker, and even the candlestick maker. Then there was the recurrent refrain, "Nobody knows the trouble I have."
Maude, Rhea's sister, was frankly impatient, and Laura, her mind on her own work of locating missing soldiers for their families, was frankly inattentive. To have so many grievances and nobody really eager to listen to them was trial enough. It made Rhea more than ever vociferous. "And after all my trouble of getting help and food and cars, half of the crowd say that they can't go. Just like that. They can't go! What about me! You'd think they'd have a little consideration"
Maude broke in here, "Now Rhea, this is no year for big house parties."
"But it's just our crowd. I've had them for so many years. I just can't give it up."
"Face the facts. There isn't any crowd. Four or five useless card-playing women."
"Being my sister does not give you the right to insult my friends." Rhea spoke from a lofty height, but Maude brushed it off with an affectionate pat.
"I haven't a thing against any of them Re, but I hate to leave you here moping and I've got to get back to work. Shall we go, Laura?"
"Yes. I must." The two women hurried away but Rhea's wail, "But you haven't told me what to do," followed them to the door.
"Crochet a bedspread." Maude suggested glibly, but Laura's advice though given hurriedly had more thought and warmth behind it. "Get a job, Rhea. Good ones are going begging."
"Me a job?" Rhea asked herself. Did Laura mean it or was she just being superior? How could she work? Why she

was over forty-five. These were her gracious years. Sometimes little things get stuck in the brain. So that phrase, "the gracious years," had stuck in Rhea's. It was a speaker referring to a woman's middle age, and he had called those in-between years "the gracious years." A beautiful moment in time that could be held indefinitely so long as health remained. Rhea had loved the idea so much that it had become her goalthose long, extended gracious years. Her own conception pictured herself in a series of dramatic hostess gowns, always the center of a crowd of enchanted friends. Ah lovely dream! Imagine if she should start to work what would become of her ideal of beautiful middle age. It was too pitiful.
"No one understands me. No one appreciates me," Rhea thought rebelliously. It was some minutes before, overcome with self-pity, she decided to call the doctor to verify her own opinion that she was not strong enough to work. The doctor would build up her self-esteem, and a little talk with him would be a moment's escape from a situation that she did not like to face. Really she was not well! Thinking about it made her certain of an illness. She did not sleep very much after an evening's excitement. Besides what of those moments of sheer revelation when things around her took on strange new meanings? She must speak to the doctor about that. It might be psychopathic. Being a rich widow approaching fifty gave one some privileges with a doctor's time. Besides Clint was an old friend of her late husband. She knew he'd be stern at the mere idea of her working. Well she'd call him anyway, and that would end the job business. If she believed in anything she believed in obeying her doctor's orders. She dialed the number and almost on the instant a crisply efficient voice answered, "Dr. Clinton's office."
"May I speak to Dr. Clinton?"
"Sorry. The doctor is busy."
"But I must speak to him. This is Mrs. Calvert. I'm an old friend. I'm not just one of his patients. I Yes, I'll hold the line."
She had to wait a long time before a voice snapped at her, "Yes?"
"Oh, Clint," she began in a leisurely conversational tone, "How are you? This is Rhea. Yes, Rhea. I had a little time and I thought I'd call you. Yes, yes, of course it's a professional call. You know last week when I came in to be checked and you didn't find anything wrong? Well, since then I remember I didn't tell you everything. You know I'm always gettingWhat's that? Come in next week and see you? But I have something to ask you now. Yes, yes. Wait a minute, Clint. It's important. Do you think it would hurt me to work? Yes, to work. Why should it? Well, I don't know, only I thought perhaps at my age.... You say you're ten years older than I am and now you're having to work harder than you ever did? Well really, what has that to do with me.?"
"Nothing, Rhea, only everybody else is working, and I can't see why you should be in a class by yourself. Besides, those crowds you wait on at your summer place every yearIf that isn't work, what is it? I mean, if you can stand that you can stand anything."

THE GRACIOUS YEARS
Rhea's voice thinned to a pathetic waver, "Well, what kind of work do you think?"
"I am a doctor Rhea, not a vocational guidance man. Good-by."
This was certainly her day! There, another friend had brushed her off with annoyance. But why? Was it because her way of life had no place in this busy world at war? Rhea was not a moron. "Everybody else can't be wrong. Turn the light on yourself," a voice inside her insisted. So reluctantly she forced herself to a reckoning. She felt terribly let down, but she was not in tears. In fact, looking at herself as at a stranger, she was half inclined to smile. She had always concentrated on getting what she wanted out of life. Her husband had been a great one to pull her away from her too avid pursuit of things. A favorite jingle of his came to her mind now:
Stop doing whatever you do do, And do whatever you don't. Whatever you don't do Might agree with you, Since whatever you do do, don't.
"That must mean a regular job for me." In spite of herself Rhea was smiling. Through force of habit she looked at the clock and turned on the radio for the news. The voice that came to her was a direct appeal, "There is a crucial shortage of adult help in the canning industry. Food will win the peace. If you have any time to spare, apply at your local U. S. Employment Office at once. Don't wait. The need is urgent."
Was that Rhea's cue to plunge, to dive in before she had time to get frightened? She fingered the tele-
617
phone directory uncertainly. What on earth could she do at a canning factory? Peel tomatoes? No, no. She'd get fallen arches, and a lame back, and have no fingernails, and she didn't have to work unless she wanted to, and she didn't want to or did she? Morning would be time enough to decide. Anyway there was the business of calling off the party at her summer placemore telephone calls. Rhea didn't go out that night. Instead she went to bed and couldn't sleep. The gnat of indecision can cause a lot of uncomfortable buzzing in the brain. But by morning Rhea had reached a decision. She hinted to Maude later that a dream about her mother had clinched the matter.
AT the Employment Office she was told that the canning factory needed an adult supervisor for girls to see that nothing slovenly was allowed, a woman who would be able to keep the standards high without antagonizing the girls. Would she like to try it? Rhea answered that she had come around to offer her services as a tomato peeler, but she would work any place they could use her, but that she had had no experience. Rhea was extremely modest today.
"Perhaps your experience with handling people will come in just right," the plant superintendent told her genially. "If not, we can still use you to handle tomatoes."
SSIX weeks later, Laura and Maude were lunching with Rhea. It was after work for all three of them. They sat on the terrace on the cool side of the house drinking fruit juice from tall glasses and eating thin sandwiches. The food was good but simple. The women were tired but jolly. Rhea had been regaling them with a recital of her first week at the factory. It had been awful at the time, but looking back in the light of her present success with the girls, it seemed merely amusing. Her listeners rocked with laughter. There was no boredom here, nor fidgeting to get away.
"I never thought you'd do it, Rhea," Laura wiped a tear away. "Though I knew you could if you once made up your mind."
"You didn't let any grass grow under your feet," Maude said. Then suddenly, "What did you dream about Mother that night anyway?"
Rhea's face suddenly changed from jocularity to a serenity that was soothing to see. "It was beautiful," she said softly. "Almost too beautiful to talk about. I had been tossing all night, and then as dawn approached I fell into a sleep peaceful as a desert twilight. It was twilight, all splendid with golden clouds and bright with the muted brightness that lingers after the sun has gone. And Mother and I were walking together in a country lane. Mother was wearing one of those huge gingham aprons, and it seemed to be full as usual with stuff from the garden. I plucked at it playfully. 'What's this you're carrying?' 'Beans,' she said, turning her face full upon me. But the smile she gave me. You remember it, Maude. How she'd look at us with such an understanding kindness after we'd been naughty, and from seriousness how her face would bloom with love. That's really all there was to the dream. Just Mother and her apron full of beans and her smile, but it was enough to turn my mind back to a real happening.
"It was the summer before my last year at college. Some of my sorority sisters were visiting with us. After supper I discovered Mother was out in the garden picking vegetables. She looked like a peasant woman, a black figure with her apron poked out in front with its earthly burden. I went out to help her, also to protest that my girl friends would think it was queer that she should be doing this menial labor. 'But why must you do it, Mother? If anyone wants these beans let them come and get them, if not let them go.' 'I can't let things go to waste,' Mother had replied. 'If the earth is bountiful we must see that its yield is harvested. I call it keeping faith with the soil, Rhea. I could not sleep if I knew things were wasting in the garden.' So when she said 'Beans' and smiled, I knew what she meant."
"'Keeping faith with the soil'what an idea. So that's why you went to the cannery," Laura mused. "I didn't know you were raised on a farm, Rhea?"
"Yes. Mother died the following year and Father sold the place so that summer was my last one there."
"What will you do when the canning season is over?"
"Guess?" but she could not give them time to guess for her own eagerness, "I'm going to be a Nurses' Aid. I've already signed up."
"But Rhea! That's real work, you know."
"Do you remember that little lec-

THE GRACIOUS YEARS
ture you used to give us about the gracious years?" Maude asked. "Where do they come in?"
"Yes, I remember very well, for after all I did a lot of striving toward those gracious years."
"And what do you think of them now?"
"I think the gracious years must
619
be those years that a woman is allowed to render service beyond her own immediate circle; and I hope the Lord will allow me quite a few of them."
"You've learned a lot in six weeks, Rhea."
"Perhapsbut it was Mother's smile that put me on the right track."
An Appeal to Mothers
(Continued from page 597) These rooms should be clean and sanitary and always equipped with clean towels, soap, and toilet paper.' Mirrors should also be provided, and the rooms should be in keeping with the rest of the building. Drapes at the windows add a touch of refinement. Mothers should see that rest rooms are properly kept up. Heating and Ventilation Mothers, the health of your families should be safeguarded by proper heating and ventilation. Lack of ventilation contributes to the spread of disease. Is the ventilation in the chapel as good as it is in your home? Fire Hazards Is your chapel a fire trap? Are fire extinguishers installed? Are they examined from year to year, so that your children's lives are safe in an emergency? The other day while visiting a chapel, fire extinguishers were found which appeared "'all ready for use." However, the tanks were emptythe liquid had never been added! Mothers, insist that your children's lives be safeguarded while in church. Look for the Label of Approval Beginning October 1, we are going to label our chapels with an award. On the merits of the upkeep of each building, it will be labeled with Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors. Now, you good mothers of the Relief Society determine, to a great extent, what is accomplished throughout the Church. May we ask that you. Demand for your fami- - lies and yourselves a fit place in which to worship. Will you demand that dark corners be cleaned out? We should be thankful for the sacrifices that are being made throughout the Church to provide better buildings and better upkeep. We are decidedly improving, but we are not through yet. For years the General Authorities of the Church have been urging us to have clean, attractive buildings. We solicit the aid of mothers in this enterprise. If you will demand better conditions, half the battle will be won. Mothers of the Church: As with the Church, so with the people. We appeal to you to bring pressure to bear in a wholesome way. Your good bishop will listen to you. Tomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd CuaptTer VII Synopsis: Following Indian Mike's raid on El Toro, Janet's desert home, which in a measure was responsible for the death of her baby, Janet draws more and more within herself. Crowded with new fears, she does not realize that she and her husband, Paul Morgan, are growing further and further apart. Dr. Potsworth, friend and mentor, intervenes. Janet, overhearing his talk with Paul and Paul's bitter answers, wakes to the realization of her selfish absorption. Paul's determination to bring Indian Mike to trial, at any cost, adds to Janet's fears, driving out, for the time at least, the old ones that have obsessed her since the day she married Paul and came to live in San Juan. There is a renewal of their old love and companionship; Paul promises to give up the fight against Mike, and Janet is happy again. 'They decide that she shall leave soon for Washington and spend the winter in her old home. Paul is to join her when -the fall work is done. But the respite is brief. Janet learns that Juanee, her Indian woman, the mother of twins, is to have another child, and all her old grief returns. Juanee tells Janet to pray to the God of her people, and she, too, will have a child.  66 NO place, anywhere, is equal to Washington in the Spring!..." Paul Morgan tamped the earth solidly around a small cottonwood tree he was planting. Every youngster had to have a swing tree. He hoped this one wasn't being planted too late in the year. He dropped to his knees and smoothed the earth lovingly, Janet's last letter repeating itself in his mind. "I wish you could see the cherry blossoms, Paul," she'd written. "Better still, I wish you could smell them and feel them against your face as Page 620 I'm doing now, and sit here beside me on this bench and look out across the Potomac. The water is scarcely ruffled, yet petals are blowing. Sand is probably pelting your face, in San Juan...." Paul straightened up and looked out over the desert, shading his eyes from the sun. Before it was an hour hotter there'd be sand all right. "You say things are looking well. I can just see themred, where green should be, copper, where there should be blue, and no water anywhere!" Paul regarded the little tree doubtfully. What did it matter if trees grew or not? Things were precious only by association; only by being shared with someone you loved. What did it matter where houses stood or whether the earth were red or green or rivers placid or not? An unyielding cliff became a refuge when a home was built against it! A penthouse empty if... "And the Potomac, Paul!" (Janet's letter intruded again.) "How different it is from the San Juan. No cliffs frown from dizzy heights along its limpid edges. Boats drift on its sun-jeweled surface. People dream along its banksSunday-morning people, people from offices and homes, hundreds of them, out to see the cherry blossoms fall! And in all this beauty Iam lonely. I guess my cherry blossoms must be shared with one I love or they bloom for me in vain... 4" TOMORROW'S CUP Paul tamped the roots of the little tree carefully. "Cherry blossoms must be shared with one you love. " he repeated softly, and as he arose a song left his lips; the little tree stood straight and firmly packed into the sand at the corner of the patio between El Toro and its warm red cliffs. Paul pushed his hat back from his forehead and let the morning wind cool his face, then he turned and went in. He took Janet's letter from the arm of his chair where it had lain within easy reach during the five days since its arrival. He spread the pages out carefully on his knee as he sat down to rest. After a while he picked them up and began to read them again, though he knew the lines by heart.. "What a bon filly person I am, Paul. When I'm there, I want to be here; and when I'm here, I want to be there. For three years now we've been seesawing back and forth between the east and the west, no nearer contentment than we were before. Three months each winter with you here, three months each summer with me there. And neither of us... Paul, when the baby comes, I'm sure everything will be different. I wish you had taken me back with you. I've been sitting here for hours thinking things over. How is Juanee? Did she bake potatoes in the ashes for me when she knew about the baby? I dreamed last night that old Mike came here and stole everything I had, that the baby was born and he took it too. I woke up, limp from fear. All the old hatreds rushed in with strangling force. This beauty, this hum of human endeavor is life, Paul. Yet only half of me is here to enjoy it.. 621 "We have only a little while to wait, now. Doctor Eldred says I'm 'bonny.' He's a Scotchy old dear as near like Doctor Potsworth as I could find. I've been thinking of Doctor Groneman all day. He and Doc should be working together in a big hospitalyet what would San Juan do without Doc...? Here's the cabman; I had no idea my three hours were up. I'll post this on my way home. "IT love you.... "Janet." Paul sighed deeply. He folded the contents of the letter away in his thoughts, as carefully as one presses a flower between the pages of a loved book. "If I should spend my winters here... Never go to Washington again... Janet would sometime forget El 'Toro. A person has to be happy. Life can't forever deny that," he thought, knowing he could never give Janet up, and that somehow he must find a way to win. He went to the water barrel, dipped a bucket in, and carried it brimming to the little tree he had planted. As he splashed it recklessly over the loose soil, a car rattled into the front yard. Doc Potsworth. He'd know the sound of that wheezy old tub anywhere. But today it was an unwelcome sound. He wanted no company. "Can't you come to meet a person?" Potsworth searched around in his pockets, knowing perfectly well that Paul knew he had the weekly mail. "Not very anxious, seems to me! Got a telegram here someplace...!" "Telegram?" Three strides brought Paul from the corner of the house to the car. 622 "Sure. Any law against that?" Potsworth thrust a yellow envelope into Paul's outstretched hand. Paul took one look at the sheet he had all but torn in two in his eagerness, gulped, and sank to the running board of the old car. Potsworth waited impatiently, but when Paul continued to gulp, unable to utter a sound, he clutched the telegram. 'Keep a privileged old friend waiting all day will you!" He read the telegram, and his own jaw dropped. "Jumpin' Jehoshaphat!" he cried, "Janet has twins!" "Twins?" Paul  questioned. "Two?" "Two!" Potsworth exclaimed. Paul repeated the word weakly: "Two." "Yes, Paul, two! You're a family man now. One boy. One girl." "Two," Paul said again, as incredulous as a child at Christmas, his face blank from astonishment. "You no savvy, Paul?" Potsworth explained patiently, shaking with inward laughter. "One begay! One mechacha!" Then he added soberly: "What I wouldn't have given to have brought those babies into the world." "But what of Janet?" Paul demanded, scarcely hearing him. "She'll be more afraid of San Juan than ever." "This ll do wonders for her, Paul. She'll have an interest now as consuming as her fear of the country. She'll come through. Just give her time." "Time! She's had little else. For years you've been telling me what to do about it. I suppose you think she'll just love coming back with a couple of babies to worry about!" "I suppose youre right. But just the same, she'll be back. No woman can resist the desire to show off a new baby. And twins... Well!" "Ill have to go to her and help her bring them home. That's a terrible responsibilitytwins!"' "I'm glad you sense it. Janet will come back if you go for her, but she'll bring back the same fears, the same prejudices. She's got to want to be here on her own." "But Doc...." "I know. I know. You want to see those kids. Sure, but you've got to let Janet bring them to you." "But it might be months!" "I'll give her exactly one and a half. And don't you go writing to her every day either." "And when I do, talk about something besides cows?" "Exactly." Paul's eyes twinkled. "If it works Pll give you a heifer calfa dozen heifer calves!" Paul began to pace the floor in his excitement. "I'll probably wake up and find myself asleep in my saddle, dreaming." "That's good. Wake up and find yourself asleep!" "Well, you know what I mean. Honestly, Doc," Paul said seriously, "T've about given up hope of winning Janet over. She's so set against this. Country that she won't give it a chance." "Let the country take care of itself, man. Quit trying to make Janet like it. Just you get ready to enjoy those kids. The country complex will take care of itself.". "I wonder." "And remember, you're just a bystander now. I'll be the important male around herenext to young Paul." TOMORROW'S CUP "Shouldn't you have included Paulette?" "Say, that's not bad! Paul and Paulette! Not bad at all!" "Doc, where's your imagination? The boy's been named Jerry for years." "Then the names won't match for I insist upon Paulette for the girl.": "And we're both reckoning without Janet. She'll probably choose Cactus and Cacti!" Paul spoke sarcastically, Janet's dislike of the country rankling as it had never done before. "Cactus and Cacti!' Doctor Potsworth chuckled, refusing to take Paul seriously. '"'Let's wire that to Janet." ~ Paul looked at him, trying to suppress his mood. "Why not?" he laughed. "She might even see the joke herself...." panel, lying in her hospital bed, surrounded by flowers and gifts, read the telegram with delight. "How perfectly adorable," she laughed. "Cactus and Cacti!" She lay back on her pillows, hands behind her head, her eyes dreamy. Paul was happy now. The little grave on the hill would never seem lonely again. Brothers and sisters make a family. What would Juanee think? Janet smiled, remembering the Indian woman's appraisal of twins: "You give me one dollar or two dollars, I take two dollars!" Janet reread her telegram from Paul with increasing delight. She'd long ago decided on Paulette for her daughter's name, and Paul would have nothing but Jerry for his son. Any children could be named that, but only born-to-the-range twins 623 could be Cactus and Cactieven in fun. "Born to the range!" Suddenly the hospital faded; the flame of setting sun through the windows became a glowing bed of coals in the center of a cave high up on Blue Mesa. Hotel Collins. Very, very far from nurses and doctors; far from the ordered loveliness that surrounded her here. She was not lying in a high white bed, but on a bed of fragrant cedar boughs in the cave; not laughing, but saying fiercely into the dark: "Ill fight you, Paul, you and your country! I'll fght you till the day I die! Ill not bring a child up a million miles from nowhere!" Then as suddenly the cave faded and she was back in the hospital, for a nurse had brought her babies to be fed. Her momentary rebellion was drowned in happiness. These were Paul's babies. They belonged back there with their father. She was suddenly inexpressibly lonely for Paul.... DAILY, Paul carried water to nourish the little cottonwood tree he had planted near the patio. "Kids need a swing tree," he told every one who would listen. All the cowboys had brought giftslariats of miniature size, saddles, bridles, mounted silver spurs with extravagant burnt designs. But the thing that touched him most of all was a gift from Indian Joehis own twins' first moccasins. Other Indians came with their whole families to offer a 'shake,' solemnly proffering their hands, leaving rich presents for the paleface twins. There were so many gifts he'd have to build a new wing at El Toro 624 to accommodate them all. "If only Janet would hurry and come," he thought dejectedly. But from the tone of her last letter the swing tree would be full grown before that happened. He sat on the back step of the patio and read the letter again. "Dear Paul, "Why don't you hurry the spring work along and come? Our babies are nearly a month old, and you haven't seen them. I'd come home if I could, but Doctor Eldred says the babies must be at least six months old before they can face the wilds. Anyway, I'd be scared to travel with them, even if you were here to help me. So you see you'll just have to come to us. I love you very much, dear. Please understand. I'd come home this minute if I could!" There was much more; but news of Washington didn't interest Paul. One word only stood out like a star "home." Janet had said "home." She could have said... Well, just "back" if she had wanted to. But she'd said "home!" A wheezy pfpht pfpht and an extra cloud of dust in the wind, told Paul he had company. It was Potsworth again. Just the person he wanted to see. "I'm going to D. C., Doc," he shouted, racing around the corner of the patio. "And you can like it or go jump in the lake!" - "And where would I get a lake, young man?" "Well, the river then!" "Practically dry. Same as your humor." "Tm not trying to be funny. Doc, I've got to see Janet and those babies. There's no reason why I shouldn't go. And besides I've run out of excuses." "Suppose I dump one in your lap?" "You couldn't invent one big enough." "No?" "Try it and see."  "You like Doctor Groneman, don't you, Paul?" "Yes. Yes, of course. But what's that got to do with..." "He's coming here, Paul." "Here? What for? And if he is, what of it? He doesn't need a nursemaid, does he?" "That's just what he does need. He's blind." "Bli... Doc, say that again." "Groneman is blind." "That's... That's not possible. Why would the Lord let a thing like that happen?" "Don't we blame too much onto the Lord? It was T. B., Paultuberculosis of the eyes; a sudden rupture, and the light went out." There was stark incredulity in Paul's eyes. "But he was a doctor! He worked with doctors constantly!" he cried. "And none of them knew. They didn't even suspect. Sometimes the blood vessels break one at a time, over long intervals, and the blindness is gradual. Rarely does it come as this did." "How awful! What'll he do now? I can't picture him a useless, helpless invalid." "He's not an invalid. And men of Groneman's caliber are never useless. He'll find other things to do to help the world." "But what can he do here if he can't see." "He can restand feed his soul. TOMORROW'S CUP It's inner vision he needs now. That's why he's coming here. Remember he said this was the top of the world?" Paul nodded. Could be perfect, even to the blind." "Will you still go gallivantin' off to Washington?" "No, of course not. Been for him and_ you, wouldn't be here today, Doc." "There you go again, you blame God for natural consequences and leave Him out when He plays the big part." "Most of the time I feel that He is pretty near, here on the desert." Paul picked up a wire and began fastening it to the little tree. "But at times He seems pretty remote." "Here, Ill give you a hand with that tree,' Doctor Potsworth said, breaking the tension in. His own shrewd, kindly way. "Groneman knows about the twins, Paul." If it hadn't Janet "Yes, El Toro "When will he come?" "By the end of the week." "Tll be ready. Joe and the foreman can take over. I'll stick around here." "To the north a little, Paul." Potsworth straightened the tree's small trunk. ""A tree has to be braced against the wind." They worked in silence, making a boot for the trunk from an old piece of garden hose, fastening it by a guywire to a peg in the ground, so it could not give against the strong north winds. When Paul spoke again, his voice was low and unsteady. I'm scared, Doc. What if I do and say the wrong things?" "You will, sometimes. Who wouldn't? But you'll manage. Good-by." "What will Janet think?" Paul said to himself, and went inside. (To be continued)  Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Continued from page 610) by daily communion with Him.
