THE following report, submitted by the Worland Branch Relief
Society, of which Sylvia Neilsen is president, tells of another centennial celebration:
"For our centennial party, Mrs. Wilber Wortham, Mrs. Ralph Crowton and Mrs. Louis Gibbons presented the playlet 'Is It Possible?' as the feature attraction on the program for the evening. The dinner table, which was set for sixty members and their husbands, as guests, was centered with a five-tier birthday cake decorated with 100 blue candles in gold rosebuds. When these candles were lighted, they were reflected in the large mirror upon which the cake stood. The greetings sent through recordings from President Grant and President Lyman were played for the enjoyment of the members. The Singing Mothers, a newly-organized unit, sang several beautiful songs."

BERTHA BERGSTROM, secretary of the North Hollywood Ward Relief Society, wrote concerning this ward's celebration:
"Approximately 140 were present to celebrate this anniversary. Each woman present was given a corsage made of a giant jonquil tied with royal blue ribbon. Members of the Priesthood present were given boutonnieres of bachelor's-buttons. The members of the bishopric presented the Society with a gorgeous basket of pink tulips and pink and white stocks. The program included several talks about Relief Society, the reading of minutes, and musical numbers, some of which were rendered by the Singing Mothers. The phonograph record bringing greetings from

President Grant and President Lyman was played and greatly enjoyed. A special presentation, a box of candy, was made to Helen Lofstrom, seventy-seven years old, who has been a member of Relief Society for fifty-five years. Although she is now inactive because of her age, she is one of the Society's most generous contributors when called upon by the visiting teachers. The accompanying picture shows our centennial birthday cake. Rose Broderson Whitaker, portraying Emma Smith, and Thelda Richardson, ward Relief Society president, prepare to cut the cake. The emblem and slogan of Relief Society appearing in the center of the cake were removed to be framed as a memento of the centennial."

Shelley Stake (Shelley, Idaho)
SARAH KIRKHAM, work-and-business leader of the Shelley Second Ward Relief Society, re-
ported that although Shelley Stake was very disappointed in not being able to complete its elaborate plans for the centennial, the wards made a special effort to make their programs successful. The program held March 17 in the Second Ward was splendid. It included the playing of the recorded greetings from President Grant and President Lyman, a pageant, "Long-Remembered Words," a talk, "One Hundred Years of Relief Society," by Sarah Kirkham, musical selections, a humorous reminiscence, and a retold story. The observance also included a luncheon at which a beautiful birthday cake was cut by Sarah Young and Mary E. Thomas, oldest members in this ward. To conclude the entertainment, members of both the Shelley First and Second Wards attended a dance held in the tabernacle. Lula Bowler is president of the Second Ward Relief Society.

RUTH I. WEIDNER, secretary of Stratford Ward Relief Society, sent us the following account of its ward centennial observance:
"As a memorial to the centennial of the Relief Society, the Stratford Ward of Highland Stake presented a pageant entitled Immortal Mothers, written and directed by Erma B. Steffensen. Thirty-five adults and twenty-three children participated. It depicted the glorious lives of the general presidents of Relief Society. Two women, beautifully dressed in white, read the pageant, which told of the devotion and
unceasing service of these great women. The opening paragraph was as follows:
Behold; and it shall come to pass that in the last Dispensation of the Fullness of Times, God shall touch the souls of the women and make them scribes to His holy word in this kingdom on earth.
"A short history of Relief Society followed, and a tableau showed the outstanding accomplishments of each president. In brief, the order and content of the tableaux were as follows:
FirstJoseph Smith. SecondJoseph and Emma Smith. ThirdEliza R. Snow. She crossed the plains, carrying the precious records of the first Relief Society. FourthZina D. H. Young. She teaches her own and four of Brigham Young's children to make soap, candles, and to card wool for material for their clothes. FifthBathsheba W. Smith. She is shown bowed in grief, saddened by the death of her mother and infant son at Winter Quarters and her son George, who was killed by the Indians. SixthEmmeline B. Wells, noted for her gift of writing, is shown unveiling the Sea Gull Monument on Temple Square. SeventhClarissa Williams is shown caring for sick and crippled children. EighthLouise Y. Robison, noted for her temple work, starts the Singing Mothers' organization and the campaign for 100,000 members in Relief Society. NinthAmy Brown Lyman, present general president, was represented in the tableau in person. She sat in the center of the stage, dressed in a beautiful black velvet dress. She was presented with a bouquet of red roses. A poem, "The Glory of God," was read during this tableau.
"For the finale, two R. O. T. C. Students in uniform wheeled a model of the campanile onto the stage as the seven presidents (other

than President Lyman) came and stood back of President Lyman and sang "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning." The closing paragraph of the pageant was:
Behold, and it came to pass, that so great was their diligence, so deep was their love, so broad their charity, that angels traced on gold records the names of each of these "The Immortal Mothers" in the mansions on high, and yea, in the hearts of these "The Immortal Mothers" in thy kingdom on earth, God shall dwell forever, and forever.
"Music for the pageant was furnished by the Singing Mothers and a string ensemble. It included 'A Song of Triumph,' by Beatrice F. Stevens, 'In Thy Form' by Florence Jepperson Madsen, 'O My Father,' 'Our Mountain Home So Dear,' and 'Though Deepening Trials.'"

TREMELLING ssubmitted this account of the Hoytsville Ward centennial program: "On the evening of March 17, 1942, we presented an original pageant in two parts, entitled 'From Out of the Past. The first part, 'In My Garlen of Memories,' portrayed the history of the ward organization in dialogue form out of our 'Book of Memories.' "The second part depicted the first organization of Relief Society by the Prophet Joseph Smith. A lighted candle in a lovely sctting represented the blessings and _privileges women attain through Relief Society. As appropriate verses were read, candles were lighted consecutively by members representing the Relief Society general presidency, stake and ward officers, class leaders, visiting teachers, and. Singing Mothers, after which a candle-lighting song was sung. A large cake which was later cut and served, was brought on the stage. 'A Song of Triumph,' and a closing song and prayer concluded the program." Nellie R. Crittenden is president of this ward Relief Society. Crossing The River (Continued from page 178) velop, they now began to establish the comfortable pattern of life which they had left in Utah. These pioneers were coming to realize that their ideals had not changed because of privations, and that even when they were living in shanties and dirtroofed houses, the finer things of life were treasured and cultivated. Flowers were planted which bloomed. 'Throughout all the tragic troubles over water, the tea kettles in Arizona bubbled as blithely as ever they did in Utah. The friends who were bound into a oneness that day of the "crossing," were ever the real friends. Always believing, finally they knew that Arizona was also Zion. An Arizona Temple had been promised, and was built. Human ingenuity and close spiritual ties built a bridge across the Colorado and a new and easier road to beloved Utah. Today one feels no terror in looking down that almost perpendicular canyon to the ribbon-like river far below. Its roar is faint, like an echo from the past. The Arizona of the pioneers is to its children and its children's children the "land of heart's desire." Happily, lustily they sing her state song "O Arizona, Sun-Kissed Land!" Prayer for Relief Society "We would hold up before thee, O Lord, the Relief Societies, with all their members; and all those who preside in their midst according to their callings and appointments, general or local. Bless the Teachers in their labors of mercy and charity, who, as ministering angels, visit the homes of the sick and the needy, bearing succor, consolation and comfort to the unfortunate and sorrowful." From Dedicatory Prayer by Pres. Wilford Woodruff at Dedication of Salt Lake Temple Work -and- (Business New-fashioned Thrift Lesson 8 Preservation of Victory Garden Products (For optional use on Tuesday, May 11, 1943) HE thought of harvest and preservation of food is usually linked with autumnthe time when all the luscious, varicolored fruits and vegetables, brimful of vitamins and minerals, make such a definite appeal to the appetite. However, harvest time is not any One season in this country; our food crops are gathered the year round. But in spite of the continuous production, most small fruits and quick-ripening vegetables, such as strawberries, raspberries, peas, and asparagus are short lived and are seasonally found on the market. Because of this, and in order to have such foods in the daily diet, it is important to preserve them in such a way as to retain their natural flavor, form, and food value. Although many Victory Gardens were grown last year, there are indications that many more, on a much larger scale, will be grown during the coming season. In order that time, energy, and manpower will not be lost, every bit of the food produced should be utilized. 'That which is not used immediately, when fresh, should be preserved by storing, canning, drying, or freezing. Storing Some kinds of crops are better suited to storage than others. 'This should be kept in mind at the time of planting; but whatever kind is grown, its proper stage of maturity for successful storage must be considered. Underripe products shrivel and do not keep well, while overripe ones are usually inferior in quality. Vegetables and root crops when stored do not all require the same temperature nor humidity, and the storage periods differ. Beets, carrots, turnips, and similar vegetables keep best when stored at 32-36 F. With relative humidity of 85-95 per cent, and will keep four to five months. Squash and pumpkins require 40 F. With relative humidity of 50-70 per cent. Potatoes should be stored in a dark place with a relative humidity of 85-90 per cent, and keep best at 35-40 F. Higher temperatures cause them to sprout soon, and sometimes cause a decay in the center known as "black heart.' Apples like a cool, moist atmosphere and will keep crisp and firm many months if properly stored. In preparing fruits and vegetables for storage, those with any kind of bruise, crack, or injury shoud be separated from the more perfect ones; defective ones should be used first and only firm ones stored permanently. There are several types of storage, and the kind best suited to your circumstances and needs should be used. Parsnips, carrots, and horseradish can be left in the ground all winter with a covering of straw, and dug or pulled as needed. Next to this type, the mound is the simplest form of storage. A layer of straw is Page 222 222 put on the area of ground needed, then the vegetables are piled on it in mound shape and covered with a layer of straw and then a layer of soil. The thickness of the covering will depend upon the severity of the weather in a given locality. A storage pit is made by digging a hole one to one and one-half feet deep and three to four feet wide. The pit is lined with straw, and the vegetables are piled into it in pyramid shape and covered with straw and soil. Freezing weather requires a thick layer of soil. Indoor cellars, if cool and ventilated, are good, but the modern, heated home with a cement basement is not so good for the storage of raw fruits and vegetables. Outdoor cellars are built on a more elaborate scale, and are used when it is planned to store large amounts of food products. Canning Canning is a type of food preservation used more extensively by house- wives than any other type. All kinds of fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, and fish can be preserved in this way. The methods which may be used are known as: open kettle, pressure cooker, water bath, steamer, and oven. To be perfectly safe, however, in canning non-acid vegetables and meats of all kinds, a pressure cooker should be used. In using a pressure cooker, instructions for its proper use and care should be studied carefully to prevent accidents and waste of food. A pressure cooker is as safe as any other piece of equipment and is easy to handle if a few precautions are taken. With the open kettle method, fruits are cooked in syrup until just tender, packed in sterile glass jars and sealed quickly and completely. Care must be taken with this method to prevent bacteria-laden air from getting into the jars when filled. 'The water bath method is used for fruits and tomatoes. With this method a kettle or wash boiler is used which has a tightly fitting lid and which is deep enough to permit covering the jars with two inches of water. A wooden or wire rack is fitted into the bottom of the kettle to keep the jars from breaking. The water is kept boiling during the entire process, otherwise, water from the boiler may replace some juice from the jars. The cooking period is counted from the time the water begins to boil vigorously. The steamer method is used for the same kind of products as the water bath. 'There must be a good circulation of steam to insure efficient sterilization of the products to be processed. A steamer may be made for the purpose, or the same equipment as that used for the water bath method may be used. Directions for operating the type of steamer used should be carefully followed. Oven method is recommended for berries and small fruits only, and should be used only when heat can be controlled. Peaches, pears, and other large fruits do not get sufficient sterilization with this method; a brownish discoloration often develops which does not always show up until the jars are opened. Drying Vegetables and fruits may be dried to remove sufficient moisture to prevent spoiling. Drying can be done at home in a dehydrator. Because fruit turns dark when cut or peeled, LESSON DEPARTMENT better results are obtained if this change can be brought about before the drying is done. Sulphuring or the use of a salt solution will help to accomplish this. The latter is easier when the drying is done at home, but it does not result in as good a finished product. In using this method the fruit is peeled, and then immersed in the solution (6 level tbs. Salt to 1 gal. Water). Fruit may also be dried without peeling. Non-acid vegetables and those which cannot be preserved by storing can be dried when a pressure cooker is not available. Freezing Like drying, freezing as a method of food preservation, especially for meats, was used in early days when no other method was available. But only within the last ten or twelve years has this method developed so that all the food values are retained and the products are like perfectly fresh ones. Quick freezing is not cold storage. In quick freezing the temperature. Is lowered so fast that the ice crystals do not enlarge and cut the delicate cell walls. When the products are defrosted, the original flavor and juices are still there. Not all foods, however, yield to this process in the same way, but as time goes on more foods are being successfully preserved by this method. So far, this is not a practical home process, but many housewives have access to community lockers and are learning to prepare their own products for freezing, or they pay a small 223 amount to have them prepared by a plant. Locker plants are mostly operated as a community project or by ice companies and meat dealers who rent space to their customers. Whichever process of preservation is used, the same care in the selection and preparation of the foods is necessary as though the foods were to be used immediately. Firm, wellmatured products should be carefully and quickly handled and thoroughly cleaned. All utensils, jars, caps, rubbers, and other containers must be perfectly sterilized. 'The time of the processing should be carefully calculated so the product will not be underdone or overdone. The careful storing of canned and dried foods is important. A cool, dark, dry atmosphere is best for food in glass containers. It is advisable to give foods dried in the sun a final heating in the oven to kill any microorganisms that might be present. Foods dried in a dehydrator will be free of any of these, but should be stored as soon as they are cool, in airtight cans, jars, or small paper bags. If dehydrated foods are put in cartons which hold only an amount sufficient for use at one time, then large amounts will not be disturbed nor exposed to the air unnecessarily. Note: Space will not permit detailed instructions on all the methods and procedures of preservation, but help and instructions may be obtained from the extension personnel of the various agricultural colleges. Every housewife should pre. Serve all the food that she can use.  There's Always A Way (Continued from page 207) He stood there, beseeching his father with his wide, blue eyes, and Mr. Allen and Janet could hardly bear it when two tears welled up and spilled down the cheeks they loved so dearly. "Daddy! Can't Ihave Spot? He's _ all alone, and he doesn't want me to leave him!" "Spot?" Mr. Allen pretended not to understand. Stevie nodded. "He knew me as soon as I came into the room," he explained, "And I knew him. He wants to be my dog, and I want him. The man said nobody else wants him. Please, Daddy?" Mr. Allen climbed down from the car. "Let's see about this," he said, and Janet hurried to follow them into the office again. "Why, of course Stevie can have the puppy if he wants him," the man smiled. "I think it would be fine. He's the kind of puppy that needs a boy like Stevie, and I'm sure Stevie is the kind of boy that needs a puppy like Spot." When the door to Spot's cage was opened, there was no doubt about this. Spot gave one leap and was in Stevie's arms, and he cuddled there, licking Stevie's face, and wiggling with joy all the way home. As soon as the car was stopped, Stevie leaped out and went running to the house, Spot scrambling about in his arms. "Mommy! Mommy!" Stevie was yelling at the top of his voice, gay and noisy as he used to be, "Come here. Come see Spot! Mommy!" Janet looked at her father and he looked at her. "Sometimes you wonder just what to do about things," she said, "but if you think hard enough, there's always a way." Her father bent and kissed her. "Do you know what, Sweetheart?" he said softly, "If they lined up all the little girls in the world, and all that ever will be in the world, and marched them past me, I know which one I'd pick. She's got freckles on her nose and her hair is the color of ripe sunshine" Janet was so happy she could almost cry. Stevie was happy again, her daddy was happy again, and now she and Mommy could settle down to the serious business of getting things ready for the new baby. SLEEPING PUPPY Courtney E.
