report forms with which Magazine subscription report forms must be compared, the publication of the Magazine honor roll will be delayed until May.
Relief Society officers and Magazine representatives are to be commended upon their efforts during the past year in the interest of the Magazine. The present circulation is the largest in the history of the periodical. This is particularly gratifying at a time when the Magazine is so

greatly needed by Latter-day Saint women. The General Board appreciates the many demands now made upon the time and ability of women and acknowledges with gratitude the loyal service of those who have secured the present large number of Magazine subscriptions.
Relief Society women will await with interest the publication of the honor roll, and those whose names appear on this roll may feel justly proud.
Relief Society Broadcast, March 14, 1943

Over radio station KSL is being given over to the use of the Relief Society in recognition of its 101st birthday which falls on March 17, 1943.

1943 Red Cross War Fund Campaign
THE Relief Society General Board calls to the attention of Relief Society women the 1943 Red Cross War Fund Campaign which is now underway, and recommends that announcement of this campaign be made in Relief Society meetings and that Relief Society members, as individuals, be urged to contribute liberally to this worthy cause. Funds for the humanitarian work of the Red Cross are more urgently needed this year than ever before, and the campaign merits the support of every individual who is earning. Solicitations for funds began March 1, 1943.
The policy of the General Board with respect to Relief Society participation in Red Cross work remains the same as stated in Blue Bulletin No. 24, as follows:
"The policy of the General Board, approved by the First Presidency, with respect to Red Cross calls for funds is to give publicity to them and to encourage members of the Relief Society to respond to such calls, as individuals. This means that Relief Society would not be used as an agency for the actual collection of funds.
"Contributions to the Red Cross should not be made by Relief Society organizations as such, from the funds of the organization. It is not expected that one relief organization should contribute to another from the funds collected for its own particular work."
The letter sent to ward bishoprics by the First Presidency, recognizing the lofty ideals and compassionate services of the American Red Cross, and endorsing the 1943 Red Cross War Fund Campaign is reproduced herewith:
February 15, 1943
TO THE BISHOPRICS OF THE CHURCH:
The mission of the Red Cross is to serve humanity; it fosters kindliness of spirit; it radiates Christian brotherhood. Wherever there is a wounded soldier, wherever there is pain or suffering on the field of battle or at the home front there may be found the tender mercies of the ameliorating services of this beneficent organization. It is one banner under which all humankind may enlist in a common cause of mercy and compassion.
Millions of men in armed forces are marching, sailing, and flying to kill and to conquer. Millions of men and women under the international banner of the Red Cross are marching to administer relief, to give succor, and to save.
To make effective and successful this humanitarian work, funds are indispensablethis year more than ever before. The campaign for "The 1943 Red Cross War Fund" is already under way. This is not the annual roll call, nor a drive for membership, but it is an appeal to every person earning a dollar to contribute to a great and worthy cause.
The Church, recognizing the services of the American National Red Cross as conforming to the lofty ideals and divine principles proclaimed by the Savior of mankind, now urges all its members to contribute funds more liberally than ever before to succor the wounded, to aid the sick, and to comfort the distressed.
Red Cross Sunday is February 28, 1943. Solicitations will begin March 1, 1943. Now is the time for every man, woman, and child to heed the Nation's clarion call to service.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed) Heber J. Grant J. Reuben Clark, Jr. David O. McKay

Graduate Nurses Urged to Return Inventory Cards
THE General Board is pleased to cooperate with the National Nursing Council for War Service by requesting stake and mission Relief Society presidents in the United States to announce through their local Societies the inventory of the nursing forces of the country which is now underway. This inventory is being conducted by means of a schedule to be filled in by all registered nurses, irrespective of age, including those actively employed and those who are married or retired. It is believed that there may be many registered nurses not now employed in nursing work who might be available in a national emergency. The states and the nation must know the strength of its nurse power in case of local or national emergency.
Each state in the nation has its own registration bureau, and every graduate nurse should contact the bureau in her state and obtain a schedule to be filled in and returned to the bureau.
