work-and-business leader of the Shelley Second Ward Relief Society, re-
ported that although Shelley Stake was very disappointed in not being able to complete its elaborate plans for the centennial, the wards made a special effort to make their programs successful. The program held March 17 in the Second Ward was splendid. It included the playing of the recorded greetings from President Grant and President Lyman, a pageant, "Long-Remembered Words," a talk, "One Hundred Years of Relief Society," by Sarah Kirkham, musical selections, a humorous reminiscence, and a retold story. The observance also included a luncheon at which a beautiful birthday cake was cut by Sarah Young and Mary E. Thomas, oldest members in this ward. To conclude the entertainment, members of both the Shelley First and Second Wards attended a dance held in the tabernacle. Lula Bowler is president of the Second Ward Relief Society.

RUTH I. WEIDNER, secretary of Stratford Ward Relief Society, sent us the following account of its ward centennial observance:
"As a memorial to the centennial of the Relief Society, the Stratford Ward of Highland Stake presented a pageant entitled Immortal Mothers, written and directed by Erma B. Steffensen. Thirty-five adults and twenty-three children participated. It depicted the glorious lives of the general presidents of Relief Society. Two women, beautifully dressed in white, read the pageant, which told of the devotion and
unceasing service of these great women. The opening paragraph was as follows:
Behold; and it shall come to pass that in the last Dispensation of the Fullness of Times, God shall touch the souls of the women and make them scribes to His holy word in this kingdom on earth.
"A short history of Relief Society followed, and a tableau showed the outstanding accomplishments of each president. In brief, the order and content of the tableaux were as follows:
FirstJoseph Smith. SecondJoseph and Emma Smith. ThirdEliza R. Snow. She crossed the plains, carrying the precious records of the first Relief Society. FourthZina D. H. Young.

than President Lyman) came and stood back of President Lyman and sang "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning." The closing paragraph of the pageant was:
Behold, and it came to pass, that so great was their diligence, so deep was their love, so broad their charity, that angels traced on gold records the names of each of these "The Immortal Mothers" in the mansions on high, and yea, in the hearts of these "The Immortal Mothers" in thy kingdom on earth, God shall dwell forever, and forever.
"Music for the pageant was furnished by the Singing Mothers and a string ensemble. It included 'A Song of
