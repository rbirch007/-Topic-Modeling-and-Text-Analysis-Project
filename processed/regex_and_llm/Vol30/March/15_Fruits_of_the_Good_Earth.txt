Fruits of The Good Earth
Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, The Deseret News
AMONG the sweetest of my stored up childhood memories are those times when we children were allowed to intrude into my grandmother's sanctum sanctorum, her own private refuge and pride, her neat and well-tended kitchen garden where she spent so many long and happy hours. I still recall with a thrill, the delight of entering through that stout and forbidding gate which could close with such finality to keep out flocks of marauding hens and their numerous families, occasionally wandering and curious cows, and yes, squads of assorted sized, eager youngsters of the neighborhood. How exciting to be turned loose among such delectable goodness, what marvels of neatness and fresh smells abounded on all sides to invite healthy young appetites! Even the humble turnips were tender and sweet as we pulled them from the rich soil and ate them on the spot! Incredulously delicious were the tiny ripe strawberries we culled, and how enticing were the long, dangling, jeweled pennants of fruit which hung so invitingly on the rows of currant bushes, both the ruby-red and the translucent white varieties. While as for a certain precious grapevineone of the few growing in the entire high mountain communityhow we loved to reach up its ancient stems which coiled to the top of the wall to pluck the juicy clusters, eventually emerging with mouths gory with purple stain. Truly we reveled in the sweetness of those carefully tended fruits and vegetables as we crammed them into hungry small mouths.
Both young and old were privileged to enjoy the full flavor of such home-grown fruits in those days, for almost every home had its rows of berry bushes. Then came the improved methods of transportation and market gardens to supply the family needs, and the growing of these small fruits gradually became less and less usual until now, we seldom see berry patches in any but the commercial gardens. The sad ending to the story is that in choosing the easier way of acquiring our home fruits, we have renounced their greatest charm, their full and natural flavor. No market can bring these delicate fruits to our doors retaining the natural, delicious aroma intact, even in this age of miracles. Most berries are picked for the market before they are entirely ripe in order that they may "stand up" under the journey from grower to consumer; or if they are left on the bushes until they are ripe, they become a wilted and faded mass ere they have arrived at their destination. There are actually many of our own generation who have never tasted the true delights of these flavorsome but perishable fruits because they have eaten only those sold in the markets. It is only when we eat these tender fruits soon after they are picked, with all their luscious goodness dew-

fresh, that we know all their true sweetness. Then indeed are they "food for the gods," real nectar and ambrosia.
BUT with the coming of war with its many demands upon the facilities of our own country, our Government is urging, yes even is demanding, that home owners again work the soil and make every bit of ground produce food. We are urged to include berries and other small fruits in our Victory Gardens to provide our own families with these necessities, and thus leave our market crops for our vast armies as well as our less fortunate Allies. Last year, many home gardeners found how profitable such an undertaking was, even in the small city backyard. Soon, we may again be enjoying all the joys of growing our own berries, and thus become acquainted with the newest types, some of which are vastly superior to the old varieties grown in grandmother's day.
In the case of strawberries, which are perhaps the easiest of all berries for the small city gardener to manage, one may now have not only early, mid-season, and late varieties, but high quality everbearing strains which will begin to produce soon after the June berries are over, and continue to provide berries of fine flavor and texture until late October. Such new varieties as "New Mammoth" are to be recommended for their fine quality. By planting these everbearers as soon as the ground is workable, and by removing all runners as they appear as well as the first crop of blossoms, these everbearers will bear a full crop the same year that they are
planted, whereas the ordinary strawberry does not produce a good crop until the second year after planting. Some growers advocate that the everbearers should be planted afresh every year, and the first crop of blossoms removed to store up strength for a full later crop, thus producing the finest berries in one short season.
A new variety of raspberry is also making history and giving home gardeners the benefit of a most luscious, seedless, and delicious of raspberries, far finer than any of the old common everbearing kinds. Imagine having these delightful fruits from mid-July on almost until snow flies! This is actually true of the new "Colossus." The first crop is produced on the canes which grew last year, and a later developing cane grows up and gives a long season during the fall months. The size, flavor, and color of this fine new variety of fruit are exceptional. Almost any garden can find room for at least a few raspberry bushes, for they will do well in a little shade. While the bushes should have some sun, they will also welcome coolness and protection from hot drying conditions. Provide rich, well fertilized soil and plenty of moisture if you would grow berries of which you can boast to your neighbor. Two or three plants for each member of your family will supply you with berries enough for your table use. Do not plant too many bushes but give those you do plant good care and attention.
Currants and gooseberries are also excellent subjects for any backyard garden, for these, too, thrive well in some partially shady spot. Rich soil, plenty of moisture, and attention to pruning when the bushes have been

PIONEER GARDEN
Apricot, plum, and pear trees; raspberry, gooseberry, and currant bushes; and grapevine at extreme right are all found in this early day backyard.
Growing a few years, will give good returns.
FOR the home gardener who has a little more room in which to grow fruit, we have those richly flavored berries that are almost classed as aristocrats, the zestful loganberry, the luscious and nectar filled boysenberry and the jolly plump blackberry. These fruits are fit subjects for some poet's rhyme when fully ripened and eaten dew-fresh from the bush. The tart and flavorless specimens often sold are but poor and tasteless shadows of these berries when picked in their primesweet and fragrant with the sun. These berries should be trained on some support, and a pleasant little garden could surely be made by combining all of these fine subjects to make a small berry garden. Utility could combine with beauty, for the blackberries, dewberries, and others could be trained on any fence or trellis, while annual flowers could easily be planted between the bushes grown in rows, and thus they could receive moisture with no extra effort.
Warning should be given that only enough bushes for the family needs be planted. The picking of fruit becomes a task if large plantings are grown, and thus the fruit garden becomes a problem in upkeep. A few well-cared for plants will give far greater and better returns than a larger planting which is indifferently cultivated. Do not put out bushes enough to become burdensome.
Join the ranks of the city gardeners and bring to your table all the delicious fruits of the good and bounteous earth!
