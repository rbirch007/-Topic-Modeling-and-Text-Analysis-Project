The Gold Watch
Mary Ek Knowles Third Prize, Relief Society Short Story Contest
WHEN old Tom Edwards, night watchman for Bryson and Laird's department store, rang the station near the fur vault the first time, Ben Phillips was setting the time lock.
"How are things going, Tom?" Ben called.
"Can't complain, Ben." Tom's voice lacked its usual friendliness. He couldn't explain why, but instinctively he mistrusted the manager of the Ready-To-Wear Department. The man was just too good to be true with his perfectly tailored clothes, his sleek dark hair, his easy smile, and his smooth flattering voice.
"How is your wife since the weather got cooler?"
That question stopped Tom who was walking past as Ben locked the fur vault. His blue eyes clouded. "Not so good," he said slowly. "The least chilly breeze is enough to cripple her with rheumatism for days. Last winter she had to use a cane. I'm afraid she'll be worse this year."
Worry gnawed at Tom's mind. Poor Annie! And with all her suffering, no whining, just a patient smile that fair tore your heart out.
"Why don't you take her to Florida, Tom?" Ben Phillips pulled several brightly colored travel folders from his pocket and handed them to the watchman. "Look through these. Warm southern climate and sunshine are what she needs."
Tom reached for the folders. "Why, thanks, Ben," he said looking

at the younger man with kinder eyes. Perhaps his instinct had been wrong. After all, he had nothing against Phillips. Mr. Bryson and Mr. Laird trusted him. Ben had been with the store only one year, yet it was he who locked the vault and carried a key to the store on his key ring.
Tom took the travel folders and sighed. "Florida is the place for Annie, all right, Ben. But I haven't the means. There's been my son, David's, schooling, and Annie's doctor bills. No, Florida is out of my reach, Ben."
Ben frowned and twirled his key ring. "You've been here twenty-five years. Seems to me, Tom, a prosperous store like this should do something special for you. Tell you what. I'm going to suggest to Mr. Laird that you be given a winter's vacation in Florida with all expenses paid for you and your wife."
Tom's senses reeled. A vacation in Florida with all expenses paid! Then the night watchman came down out of the clouds. The store owed him no such grand present! All these years it had given him steady work and a short vacation every year, with a turkey at Thanksgiving and a small bonus at Christmas.
"Thanks, Ben," he said, putting the folders in his back pocket, "But the firm owes me nothing!"
With a start he realized that he had halted on his rounds and there were some fifteen stations yet to ring in. He took a large gold watch from his
THE GOLD WATCH
vest pocket and looked at it. "I must be going. I'm a little late on my first round."
"That's an interesting watch," Ben remarked.
Late or not, Tom had to tell the story. "It was given to one of my folks by King George III way back in 1732." Tom Edwards displayed the black Roman numerals and slender gold hands of the timepiece that had ticked off so many hours of his sixty-eight years of life. He turned the watch over and pointed to the engraving. "That's the Edwards coat of arms."
"An oak tree and a sword. Honor et Veritas," Ben read.
"Honor and Truth!" Old Tom interpreted proudly. "When my father handed me this he said, 'Son, what I'm passing on to you is more than just a gold watch. It is a name untouched by shame or dishonor!' And tomorrow," the watchman told the department manager, "my son, David, gets this watch as a present when he graduates from medical school."
Tom Edwards was a short man, lean of body and face, yet as he stood there, his straightness, something in the way he held his well-shaped head with its mane of white hair, gave him height and dignity.
"Quite an heirloom!" Ben said, "but doesn't the loud ticking disturb you?"
Tom chuckled as he replaced the watch in his vest pocket. "So used to it, I never hear it! Thanks again for the folders." Turning quickly, Tom stumbled over a large suitcase, then righted himself and continued on his rounds. Later that night he studied the 167 MARY EK KNOWLES travel folders while he was eating his lunch. He sat on the wooden bench at the foot of the stairs in the basement of the store and slowly turned the rainbow-colored pages. Florida! His wistful eyes read every line of description, missed no detail of the vivid pictures. White beaches and green water... Palm trees against a blue sky... And sunshine, always sunshine! Annie could sit on the beach all day and feel the sunshine soak into her body. Reluctantly old Tom closed the folder and set it next to his lunch box. What was the good of wishing for the moon. He had better forget Florida. He looked at his watch, lam. Time to start his round of the store again. He creaked to his feet, hooked his gun belt tighter, 168 picked up his flashlight and started climbing the stairs. But the watchman could not forget Florida. The land of palm trees and sunshine continued to woo him. He finally gave up the brief struggle and lapsed into dreaming. He tried to picture the look on Annie's face if he should walk in and say, "Pack your duds, girl, We're going to Florida for the winter!"" The brown eyes that suffering could not dim, would twinkle. "Tom," she'd say, "how you do run on! Florida, land sake!" He would pick her up, then she was such a frail little thing "I ain't foolin', Annie. We are a'goin'," he'd say. "Look at these folders." The watchman came to the top of the third flight of stairs. A sheepish grin overspread his face, and he pulled at his ear. He was a great one, mooning like a love-sick calf over Florida and his Annie until he clean passed the first and second floors. By golly, that was the first time in all the years he'd been night watchman that he hadn't registered at the stations on the main and second floors first! He was about to turn and walk down the stairs when a glow coming from the third floor fur vault attracted his attention. Tom's hand went to his gun and he tip-toed noiselessly toward the light. The partly open vault door revealed Ben Phillips. For a moment Tom stood and watched him, puzzled. Ben took a brown fur coat from a large suitcase, the very suitcase Tom had stumbled over, and placed it on a hanger in the vault along with dozens of other fur coats. Then he took a black fur coat from the suitcase and did the same thing. Next, he removed a shiny brown fur coat and a glistening black fur coat from their hangers in the vault, folded them carefully and placed them in the suitcase. Tom's hold on his gun tightened as he realized what Ben was doing. Swapping cheap furs for expensive ones! Tom pushed the vault door wide. "Don't move, Phillips!" The startled man straightened with a jerk, his eyes round with complete surprise. His face was a grayish white. 'Then his scared eyes appraised the watchman's shabby clothes... His gray hair. The color returned to Ben's cheeks. "Hello, Tom," he said shakily. "Just thought I'd better check over "I saw what you did, Ben!" Ben avoided the stony look in the old man's eyes. He took a billfold from his coat. He extracted four bills and held them out. "Forget you ever saw me in here." Tom's figure stiffened and the muscles at the sides of his jaw twitched with fury. "Don't be a sap, Edwards!" Ben croaked. "This is your chance to square things with the store. 'wentyfive years you've worked for Bryson and Laird. You don't live in a mansion on the hill as they do; your wife doesn't wear fur coats and diamonds; your son didn't have his education handed to him on a silver platter! "I had everything _ perfectly planned. Listen"' Ben's cracked voice hurried on. Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead as he explained his scheme for the perfect crime: the gaining of the complete confidence of the store's owners; THE GOLD WATCH checking on the night watchman's movements; and chatting earlier in the evening so that later, when the theft was discovered, Tom would testify that he had seen Ben locking the vault. But Ben had set the time clock for 1 a.m. And after switching the furs, he had planned to re-set it for the usual 8:30 in the morning so nobody would supect him. The travel folders! 'Tom no longer heard Ben's smooth voice. Even they had been given to make Tom more friendly toward the man he distrusted. Yes, it would have been the perfect crime if those same Florida folders hadn't made him walk as in a dream up to the third floor first, as he'd never done before. "I can give you enough money to keep you for life!" Ben pleaded. "You could take Annie to Florida, Tom! Florida" Ben Phillips hurried to paint on the watchman's mind a picture of Annie walking along the boardwalk with him, or sitting in a rocking chair crocheting, while the kind sun beat down on her thin body. A life in cozy auto courts with red-tiled roofs; checker tournaments and horse-pitching contests; and old cronies to swap yarns with. Tom's Adam's apple went up and 169 down in his thin neck. Florida would save Annie. No more cold winters for her! "No one will ever find out," Ben argued desperately, "Why not take the money?" Why not? Then in the tense silence Tom heard the loud ticking of the gold watch over his heart. Honor and Truth! Honor and Truth! Honor and Truth! Louder and louder. Tom broke out into a cold sweat. Perhaps no one would ever find out about the theft. But he himself would know. "What profiteth a " Lose his good name. Man... Why pride in a good name was the - flesh and blood of a man, the strength of his bones. It was the set of his head, the firm confident tread of his feet. It was long nights of untroubled sleep and looking at his fellowman in the eye without flinching. And he had almost thrown that away! With one swift movement Tom slammed the vault door. The lock clicked. Then he ran to the office to telephone the police. Tomorrow Thomas Edwards would give his son, David, a gold watch, and with it a priceless heritage. CONTENTMENT Fern Ostler Old rambling farmhouse 'mid great trees, Scent of violets, a gentle breeze, Fields of grain, newly plowed earth Contentment there of priceless worth. On That First Morning Vesta P. Crawford "And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun."St. Mark 16:2. Where Jesus had been laid, there came, on a morning long ago, a great brightness. The glory of this light was seen by the three Marys and by others of them who loved the Lord. In the long centuries since that day the promise of life eternal has glowed with rainbow splendor against the darkness of the world. 'This promise has become the recurrent message of springtime, the everlasting strength of hope and courage. Through all the span of time since that first resurrection, millions of people have turned to the Holy Bible to renew the brightness of Easter morning. "He is not here: for he is risen"  so came the testament of the angel nearly two thousand years ago. So comes the message down the ages for people in every land to see the beacon light. For those who may have forgotten that the stone was rolled away, there is a hallowed surety in the simple words of the gospel narratives. John and Mark, Luke and Matthewthey tell the Easter story, each in his own way, each after the interpretation of -his own heart, as the life of the Savior had inspired him. F ROM the darkness of the tomb CLEARLY etched with vivid detail is the story told by John. He explains his purpose in words that have long been remembered: "... That ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that Page 170 believing ye might have life through his name." John speaks of a garden that was near Calvary, and in that garden there was a new sepulchre. In this tomb the followers of Jesus laid His body. Even before it was light on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came into the garden and approached the tomb. The stone had been rolled away. "Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him." The disciples hurried to the tomb and found it empty. "For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home." "But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping." 'Then she looked into the tomb and saw two angels sitting where Jesus had lain. The angels said unto Mary Magdalene "Woman, why weepest thou?" And she told them that they had taken away her Lord and she did not know where they had laid Him. Suddenly she saw Jesus standing near her, but at first she did not recognize Him. He spoke her name "Mary!" And she knew that the Savior had risen from the dead. Light glowed upon the dark stones and the springtime of hope came into the ON THAT FIRST MORNING garden. "Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord...." In this, our time, when the very foundations of the earth are shaken, and the faith of many of us is tested by tragedy, is it not a quiet and precious thing to take a few moments from the rush of time to contemplate the testament of John? Now is a time for remembering that which has been written for our comfort and our surety. MARK tells the story of Christ's ministry in a series of word pictures etched with faith and understanding, etched with a splendor that has instructed the generations who have believed in the message of Easter. Mark has limned with graphic description an eternal picture of the resurrection. It is Mark who so beautifully portrays the coming of Joseph of Arimathaea, "an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God"how Joseph came to Calvary and took the body of Jesus and prepared it for burial. In a tomb hewn out of a rock Joseph laid his friend with love and care. Mark describes the coming of the Marys and the splendor of the angel's message... "Be not affrighted:... He is risen; he is not here:" - The appearance of Jesus to eleven of his disciples is presented in Mark's strong, direct words, and the command of Jesus is written... "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." And Jesus told his followers that they should "speak with new tongues." It is, as Mark implies, the duty and the pleasure of those who believe the gospel 171 to spread the message of Easter to the far places of the world. Each gospel narrator tells with great emphasis that part of the story which most appeals to him, which seems the most inspiring, the most enduring. UKE, called "the physician," was the companion of Paul on his second missionary journey, and it is he who stresses in his gospel the message of good news to all nations. "It seemed good to me also," Luke said, "having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee... That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed." Every word of Luke's narrative is imbued with strength and meaning, as if he were writing upon granite, words to last throughout the coming ages, words to comfort the nations down along the path of history. Luke says that when the women saw the angels in shining garments standing against the dark rocks of the sepulchre, they were afraid and bowed their faces. In the solemnity of the garden with bleak Calvary rising up beyond the place, the angels spoke a message of eternal life: "Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee."
It is Luke who gives the most vivid picture of the wonderful walk by evening unto a town called Emmaus. This is the event hallowed by many artists who have been inspired by this story of comfort at eventide. Hoffman, the great painter of the life of Christ, and many lesser artists
172
as well, portray this happening with spiritual insight, divining the inner glory of the farewell words of Jesus. The story of that walk along a path that led from Jerusalem to Emmaus is well remembered by all who have read the scriptural text. Two of the disciples walked by evening to this village, "And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them."
This significant event of the first Easter has been expressed in poetry:
At eventide when flowers closed And all the world was still, Two of them who loved the Lord Walked slowly up the hill; Beyond them in the valley They heard the Marys weep The path unto Emmaus town Was stony clad and steep; Then soundless was the silver night, No leaf stirred on its stem, Yet suddenly they heard a voice And Jesus walked with them.
The three travelers reached the village, but Jesus "made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent."
From these words has come the great Christian hymn, "Abide With Me."
Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!
THE words of Matthew glow with lasting simplicity. He alone of all the gospel writers tells how the stone was rolled away, how light came from darkness, the details of that first Easter. "... As it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow."
Such is the story of Easter as the disciples who lived in that far day have testified. In these precious words there is no faltering, no doubt, and no embellishment. In these words there is only simplicity, truth, and the promise of eternal life. No troubled years are long enough to dim the splendor of the message. Steadfast as spring, the promise returns and abides with us.
