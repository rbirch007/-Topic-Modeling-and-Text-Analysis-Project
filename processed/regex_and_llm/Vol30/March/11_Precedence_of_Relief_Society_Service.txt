Precedence of Relief Society Service
WHEN the Prophet Joseph Smith with prophetic vision organized the Relief Society, he marked out objectives for it so broad and so encompassing that the capabilities and talents of all Latter-day Saint women may find full expression in a devotion to carrying out the purposes for which the Society was founded.
As it was a unique organization in the realm of women and their activities in that year of 1842, so today, 101 years later, at a time when women's organizations are the rule rather than the exception, it is still a unique organization and towers pre-eminent above them all; for it is the only woman's organization in the world established by a prophet of the Lord.
The Prophet directed it along the path that it has continued to travel ever since; primarily a path of service to humanity, service that has ever been actuated by a spirit of love for the Gospel.
Membership in this organization carries with it a grave responsibility. Lip service and good will alone will not suffice. It is the woman's auxiliary of the Church, and as such, it is the proper channel through which women members of the Church serve. Its greatest strength lies in the fact that direction and guidance have ever been given it by the Priesthood of God. The general presidency of the Relief Society, who with the other members of the General Board plan the work of Relief Society, is directed by the presidency of the

Church; the Relief Society stake presidencies, who with their Boards carry on the work in the stakes, are directed by the stake presidencies; the ward Relief Society officers, who are responsible for carrying on the work in the wards, are directed by the bishoprics; and all these Relief Society officers are chosen by the Priesthood, and are responsible to them. Those sisters so chosen may rightly feel that they have been called to their positions of responsibility by inspiration, and that their offerings have been accepted of the Lord, just as the Prophet Joseph affirmed to that original small group of women desirous of banding together to further the work on the temple, that the Lord had accepted their offering and that He had something better for them than a written constitution. As we all know the Relief Society was the organization that the Lord had for His faithful daughters.
When we recall the early beginnings of the Society, the instructions, and promises made to its members which continue in force today, it is evident that the allegiance of each sister in the Church should be wholeheartedly behind the Relief Society. With the present outlook on affairs in the world and the picture that has been given us by our leaders of the sorrows and afflictions which lie in the future, it is a time when the women of the Church should devote all possible energies to building up the Relief Society and helping to carry on its work. The program of the

organization is constantly expanding not only to provide for the increased needs of the organization itself and the Church Welfare Program, but also to aid the humanitarian efforts of the Red Cross, to sew in the interest of the war effort, to help supply certain services for hospitals, and other services called for in wartime. Further obligations may face us any day.
The blessings which the Lord pours out on His daughters serving in this Church auxiliary are inexpressible. Through attendance at meetings each woman is strengthened and comforted by the beautiful spirit that is present. Expressions of gratitude and appreciation are spoken which serve as strong cords to bind the members of Relief Society into a close circle of sisterly love and devotion. Burdens are lightened through the performance of duties for others. Even aside from the intellectual benefits, and they are numerous, which Relief Society members

receive, active membership in the Society is vital for the spiritual blessings which are experienced from participation in the organization, for the Lord looks with favor upon His daughters who love and serve Him, and who unselfishly work for the joy of others.
Let us as sisters in Zion dedicate ourselves anew to the work we have been called upon to perform. May we prove ourselves as worthy as our dear sisters of long ago, who eagerly seized the opportunity presented to them by the Prophet Joseph Smith and who earned the promised reward: "You are now placed in a situation in which you can act according to those sympathies which God has planted in your bosoms. If you live up to these principles how great and glorious will be your reward in the celestial kingdom! If you live up to your privileges, the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates."
