Crossing The River Into Arizona
Pearl Udall Nelson
"A FEW more days and I shall be home again." This cheering thought has stimulated many a man and helped him to carry on when he felt exhausted, or his difficulties seemed insurmountable. The early Mormon people were deprived for years of the daily strength that the thrill and comfort of home normally provides. Every time they were compelled to move to a new location, the idea of a safe home became more of an ambition, a goal in their lives, the symbol of all they hoped for.
The desperate journey across the plains to establish themselves in the mountains might easily have failed, had not the bitter years of persecution in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinoisyears during which the Saints were seeking freedom of worshipfocused the attention of the people upon the true value of a home, and the simple things of life. Finally when they migrated to Utah, "willingly, because they had to," the homes they established became the theme of their songs, and the treasures of their hearts.
Ten, twenty, thirty years passed. The happiness and prosperity that pursue those who persistently follow a simple pattern of a full life devoid of useless meandering, had come to many Mormon communities. Then came the call for certain of these families, or their sons and daughters, to leave the well-earned fruits of their faith and labor, and cross the Great River to form new settlements in Arizona.
Arizona was a land far away, very far from "Zion." It was a weird and

strange land, described in terms that retained much of the imagery of Indian speech or terms flavored by the remembrance of the hectic marches, the endurance, and sacrifices of the members of the Mormon Battalion. It was a land of vast deserts, plateaux upon which Indians danced with rattlesnakes in their mouths, rattlesnakes that when liberated, served as messengers to their gods. It was a land of contradictions and conflicting elements: majestic mountains, bottomless canyons, miles of flat country; stifling heat, bitter cold; prickly pears and cacti, superb lilies of the desert; virgin forests, treeless expanses; no water, destructive floods. And it was not home!
Those who were called to make this journey had no prophet of their faith to lead them. Their friends and loved ones did not plan to follow them. Few, if any, expected to better their lot. Utah was Zion, Utah was home, and they but crusaders on a life-time mission to expand the borders of their homes in the mountains. Another generation perhaps, or new converts to the faith, might some day need this land and the opportunity which would be created through their years of pioneering; but the Utah streams and fields, the orchards and the flocks of sheep, the cattle, the temples, built and being built, the schools and churches, their friends and memories, belonged to them, were part of them. Now they were asked to leave all this, and start over again.

Latter-day Saints in Utah had found a completeness in a life pattern of working, going to school, going on a mission, falling in love, marrying, building a home, and having children. It was a good pattern, complete, stable, satisfying, American! Only a very devout faith in a leadership that had seen them through many difficulties and that had succeeded despite the dire predictions of the so-called "great minds" of the nation, made obedience to this call to Arizona tolerable.
Arizona lay "across the river," across the deepest abyss in all America. But the foreboding depth of that great canyon was no deeper than the psychological gulf that separated "a life in Zion" from "going forth to conquer the land of desolation."
THE crossing of the river was the first great hazard for these pioneers. It was a warning of other dangers yet to come. It was not unlike a special kind of baptism that bound those who made this journey into an understanding oneness. They became part of the legends of those indefatigable missionaries and scouts who for several years had been sent out in advance by the church authorities. These pioneers thus brought reality to the hopes and sacrifices of as courageous a group of men as

ever walked. They wrote the final chapter in one book, the saga of the Mormon scouts, and the first chapter in a new volume, the story of the Arizona pioneers.
The road from Kanab lead across a barren expanse into the depths of the Kaibab forest, and then the road lead down, down, and down. Trees were left behind, jutting sandstone cliffs loomed higher and higher and came closer and closer. Eerie shadows added to the suggestion of descending into a Stygian pit. For the women it was an experience that made them hold tightly to the "call" and the priesthood of the men who led the way.
The crossing of the muddy river was made on a ferryboat. Below them the roar of the Colorado (Spanish for red), turning white in the turmoil of dropping down between towering cliffs, reverberated back upon their ears. Emotions could not remain petty in such a setting. Women who made the crossing seemed set apart, marked with a calm faith and tender strength, and strangely free from trivialities and snobbishness. It was a time of self-renunciation that brought a new sense of trust. They had said goodby to kindred and home, with its comforts, schools, and doctors. There was no turning back. They had crossed a great river. They had now only their faith, their husbands, and their God.
Safely over the river, other hazards loomed. The road to the plateau to the east and south was treacherous. A rock set loose tumbled noisily down toward the white waters far below. If a wheel should break, a team become frightened? To glance aside, ahead, or backward was
to suffer a chill of fear or discouragement. This road seemed to be the path of Christian in Pilgrim's Progress become reality. Horses and men took one step forward, hoping for the best. Had they known it, this was to become the symbol of their life in Arizona.
When the summit was reached, as far as the eye could see there stretched out a land as barren as ever faced a traveler. Far to the south, more like a mirage than a fact, there seemed to be hills that might hold some promise. In the evening, when the camp fires were built, one could see, miles across the canyon, the camp fires of the friends who had accompanied them to the river, and were now climbing back toward House Rock and Kanab. And so, for two or three nights the camp fires of those returning to Zion and those who were leaving it seemed to signal a note of affection and love, straight across a canyon that defied a crossing.
THE Arizona pioneers, from north to south, gave all their strength and zest to the endless work they had undertaken. They settled along Silver Creek, in bad weather some three or four weeks' journey by team to the south and east, founding Snowflake; some built homes along the Little Colorado River from Round Valley and St. Johns down to St. Joseph and Sunset, now known as the abandoned colony; while others continued along the Gila River and made Thatcher the leading Mormon town, or went into the fertile valley of the Salt River where Mesa became Mormon headquarters. (Many of the settlers in Mesa came

from Bear River, north of Salt Lake City.)
In varying degrees all the colonies experienced real troubles: Indian uprisings, most serious in the Gila Valley; extreme anti-Mormon persecutions in St. Johns; and excessive heat in the Salt River and Gila Valleys. All sections were subject to alternating droughts and floods. Most of the colonies had dams washed away. St. Joseph built eight before the ninth one withstood the tricky variables of soil, heat, and flood. Woodruff had an even worse record. St. Johns' dam troubles were tragic for lives were lost, and the savings and efforts of years carried away by the swirling waters.
But usually there was enough food, although one winter (1879-80) many people lived mostly on barley-meal ground in small hand mills. Another year, in the early eighties, President John Taylor had a carload of flour sent to the St. Johns colony. In addition to a scarcity of irrigation water in St. Johns, it was also a problem to obtain water for use in the houses or to drink. At first the wells were good, but the well water later turned brackish, and so drinking water had to be hauled in from wells a few miles away at a cost of five cents a bucket. Washings were done in ditch water after it had been allowed to settle in forty-gallon barrels that stood by the garden ditch. Baths

were taken in well water and rain water was caught and saved, or snow was melted for special washing and shampooing, so mothers kept their families well and clean with a variety of waters!
In the St. Johns country our colonization was definitely resented by Mexican leaders and "cattle barons" who were there when our people came. A strong anti-Mormon feeling was fanned into a bright flame by a few men. The town newspaper and other records reveal that Mormon leaders were refused the ballot, and it was repeatedly advocated that they be driven out or killed. The women were slandered and vilified in terms calculated to start a war.
I recall clearly the "lot-jumping episode" in St. Johns. I stood on a chair between mother and Aunt Ida and watched our men tearing down a fence that other men were trying to build. I saw a big team hauling a little shanty toward Brother Babbit's lot which the "strangers" planned to "jump." A man tried to shoot the team. Twice the gun clicked but it did not fire. A little later it was learned that the firing of that gun was to have been the signal for a group of men who had been specially armed for the occasion, to start a war of extermination of the Mormon men. I remember well how mother and Aunt Ida knelt in prayer, each in turn supplicating God that this trouble and hate might pass away without death or destruction coming into our homes.
There came a time when Mormon leaders living in plural marriage were indicted by the courts. By great sacrifice funds were raised for their defense.
At a quarterly conference in St. Johns, Apostle Brigham Young called on the brethren in the northern towns to fast and attend a prayer meeting to pray for their enemies. Each of the six leaders of the "St. Johns' Ring" were remembered before the Lord and were placed in His hands. Some of the brethren were convicted by the courts and taken from their families to be sent to jail. A few fled to Mexico. In two or three years those who had been imprisoned were home again and within that time a strange fate had overtaken the six leaders of the persecution. Five of the six men met death suddenly and violently under circumstances that convinced many of their close friends that unusual accidents and "bolts from the blue," which could never have been fabricated by man, had a strange and uncanny way of doing away with anti-Mormons. The sixth member of the "Ring" had become a true friend of the Mormon people and remained so to the end of his long and honored life.
BY the nineties a new generation began to play its part. Young couples began to build new homes, and rear families to whom Arizona was the only home. Zion had increased her borders. The communities in Arizona boasted schools, churches, stores, and assets that marked them as a permanent part of the ever-widening regions being made habitable by Mormon endurance and hard work. To the new pattern of courage and sacrifice, faith and trust which they had been forced to de-
