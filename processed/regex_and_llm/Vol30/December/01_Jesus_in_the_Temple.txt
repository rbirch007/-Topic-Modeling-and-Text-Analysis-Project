"Wist Ye Not That I Must Be About My Father's Business?" President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.
And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man (Luke 2:40-52).
ITHE JOURNEY FROM NAZARETH TO JERUSALEM
It was a spring day at the end of March (near the middle of the seventh Hebrew month, Nisan), the fields were yellowing with the ripening crops, the hills and valleys were covered with wild flowers, all nature rejoiced, as Joseph and Mary and Jesus, their kinsfolk and neighbors, left Nazareth with its white rocks and cliffs, splotched with green, and started down through the foothills to the valley floor of the plain of Jezreel, one thousand feet below. They were going to Jerusalem to observe the Passover, as had been their wont over the years, in obedience to the Rabbinical law, commending (and in certain instances requiring) the observance of the feast in Jerusalem by the Levitically clean males of Israel. The women were not legally bound to attend. The feast was a jubilee of great rejoicing for it marked the anniversary of Israel's delivery from a grievous bondage to the Egyptians, and also her birth as a nation.
This journey has particular significance because it is the first appearance of Jesus in the sacred record, following His return with Mary and Joseph, to Nazareth from Egypt. After this appearance, there is another silence of eighteen years about Jesus, when being about thirty years old, He appears on the banks of the Jordan to be baptized of John. While history is silent about those first twelve years, we may reasonably know what His life was like. Joseph was a carpenter, and Jesus was undoubtedly learning the trade, for years after, when friends and neighbors for the second time rejected Him from Nazareth, they asked: "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary...?" But "From the first days of its existence, a religious atmosphere surrounded the child of Jewish parents."? This would come first from the mother, but the father was under a sacred obligation to teach his son. At the age of five or six the child was sent to school, where he began a regular course, the Bible being the exclusive textbook until the boy was ten years of age. This Bible study began with Leviticus, then passed to the other parts of the Pentateuch, thence to the Prophets, and thence to the Hagiographa,that portion of the Bible not in the law and the prophets. From ages ten to fifteen, the child studied the Mishnah, or traditional law. When he reached the academies of the Rabbis he studied the Gemara or Talmud, but a boy might not enter these till he was fifteen. We have no means of knowing whether or not Jesus attended one of these schools, but the astonishment of the doctors in the Temple over His learning would indicate He had received from somewhere, most unusual and profound wisdom and knowledge. But at twelve years, a boy became a "son of the law,"? subject to the fasts and under obligation to attend the feasts. So as these pilgrims wended downward over the foothills in the afternoon (in Palestine the first day of the journey was always a short one), they were a joyous group, chanting as they went the "Psalms of Ascent" (Psalms 120-134), to the accompaniment of a flute.?
As we think of them moving slowly down into the valley with their donkeys laden with necessary supplies, picking their way among the boulders that strewed the path, we cannot escape wondering what were the thoughts of Jesus. That He was exceeding wise, the experience in the Temple shows. But was this wisdom earthborn from His studies, or did He have also a spiritual memory that brought to Him a recollection of all that had before happened, and a vision to show what was thereafter to happen along this road to Jerusalem, a road richer in incidents of God's dealings with his children, than any other road on the face of the earth?
As to memory of the past, we do know that during His later Judean ministry, while speaking to the Jews in the treasury to the Temple, He declared: "I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.... I speak that which I have seen with my Father."? And out on the Mount of Olives, after they had left the Passover Chamber, on the night before the crucifixion, Jesus said to His apostles: "For all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you."? Thus in His later ministry, His mind was filled with knowledge gained in His pre-existence.
We do not know the details of their journey to Jerusalem, but they may well have stopped the first night at Nain, where later He raised the son of the widow;? or if the start were early enough they might have gone on to Jezreel, once the second capital of the northern kingdom. One wonders if, as He came to Nain, He saw a vision of His future miracle of kindness there. And here we may recall that in pre-vision He said to Peter in the Passover Chamber, answering Peter's protestations of faithfulness: "I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me."?
When He came to the neighborhood of Jezreel, did He see in vision the disastrous defeat of Josiah on the plain of Esdraelon by Pharaoh Necho, at Megiddo, a defeat so terrible and worked so deeply into the Hebrew heart, that John speaks of the great last battle as Armageddon"the hill of Megiddo?" Or did He see the earlier conflict in the time of the Judges, when Barak, Deborah the prophetess guiding, defeated Sisera, leading the forces of Jabin, on that same plain of Esdraelon, and did He see again the deed of Jael afterwards? And did there also come before Him the iniquities and tragic fate of Ahab and Jezebel, and the Lord's vengeance worked through Elijah against the priests of Baal, and the flight of Elijah to Carmel, the passing of the Lord before Elijah in the "still small voice"? For Jesus was the Lord who spoke to and commanded His ancient prophets.
But wherever the first night was spent, the start the next morning was early. They now moved on Roman roads, as they passed on southwards towards the city of Samaria. Crossing the headwaters of the River Kishon (which waters and drains the plains of Esdraelon), they would begin the ascent of the pass over the Carmelite range, the hill slopes probably covered with the yellow flowers of the broom. Villages dotted the high points along the way. They found rich orchards and vineyards on the summit and as they looked around them they could catch, here and there, glimpses of the Mediterranean (off to the west) and looking back to the north, they could see the snowy summit of Mount Hermon. Over to the left as they climbed up the pass, they had seen the rugged volcanic mountains of Gilboa, at the foot of which was fought the great battle between Saul and the Philistines, and where Saul killed himself. To the northeastward was Endor, the place where the witch lived whom Saul consulted, the Lord having failed to direct him, "neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets."?
As they went forward over the undulating pass, they crossed a part of the plain of Dothan,? where Joseph was sold to the Ishmaelites.? Finally, passing the summit, they descended by easy grades to the city of Samaria, located on an isolated hill 300 feet above the surrounding country.? Samaria was the next capital of the northern tribes after Shechem. It had been frequently destroyed but now as Jesus came to it, it was a great city, rebuilt by Herod the Great, with magnificent palaces, temples, and a stadium. The plain surrounding the city was exceedingly fertile, covered with orchards of figs and olives. Its beauty and its future provoked Isaiah to speak of its "glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer."? But here in the years long gone, before this visit, there had been planted a grove of Astarte (Venus), and Jezebel had erected a great temple to that same heathen goddess.? Elisha had lived at the foot of the hill on which the city rested;? and to this house came Naaman, the Syrian leper, to be healed. Elisha dwelt here when he disclosed to Ahab the plans of the Syrian generals. Here, when Benhadad the Syrian besieged it, was the scene of the great famine, so sore it was that women ate their own sons.
What must have been the feelings of the young Jesus as He looked at this present magnificence and then recalled the past, and (it seems it must be) visioned the future!
As the pilgrims went forward they were joined by others also going to the Passover in Jerusalem. On through the day, as newcomers flowed into the group, they renewed, time and again, the chant of the "Psalms of the Ascent." They lived over again in thought and story how here the Lord had blessed them and delivered them from Egyptian bondage. But of all the throng, no one but He Himself knew that that Lord traveled with them, for we must believe there was with Him a spiritual recollection, a divine knowledge, of the past.
Whether they stopped at Samaria or went on two hours further to Shechem, we do not know. But they were traveling over historic ground that reached in incident clear back to Abraham. They may, because of the prejudice against the Samaritans, have so planned their journey as to pass through Samaria in one day. But we cannot tell.
As they came into the midst of Shechem itself, they came to the very spot where the waters divided, those flowing to the west into the Great Sea, those to the east into the Jordan. The city lies where the two mountains, Ebal and Gerizim, falling away one from the other, leave a beautiful, fertile valleythe very cradle of Israel. To this valley, running out west and east from the city, came Abraham and Lot, forsaking at the Lord's command their own country under a promise that this land should be theirs.? Here lived Jacob and his family; Jacob whose name was here changed to Israel.? Here Joshua gathered the people and had them repeat the curses and blessings declared by Moses in the wildernessReuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali to stand upon Mount Ebal for the curses, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin to stand on Mount Gerizim for the blessings, the Levites repeating the curses and the people shouting amen.? Here was consummated the rebellion which divided Israel, after which Jeroboam built Shechem, and brought about the return of idolatry to Israel.? Here in the immediate area was Joseph's tomb;? at the eastern foot of the valley is the traditional site of the oak of Abraham, beneath which he built an altar," "the first sanctuary to Jehovah in the Promised Land,"" and later Joshua built there 721 an altar "under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the Lord."" Near to the site of this sanctuary is Jacob's well. On the top of Mount Ebal, Joshua placed the stones on which he had written the Law." The Samaritans believed the stones were atop Mount Gerizim." On the top of this mountain the Samaritans held their Passover feast," and the woman of Samaria, years later, said to Jesus at Jacob's well near the foot of Gerizim: "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain"; to which Jesus replied: "Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."" The Samaritans claimed that to this mountain Abraham came to offer Isaac as a sacrifice.* As Jesus looked at all these, probably for the first time with His mortal eyes, there must have crowded in upon His consciousness the scenes of the actual events. The divinity that was in Him must have reached back into the past even as, when later in His ministry, after the first Passover, He traveled northward through Samaria and stopped at the well to get a drink from the Samaritan woman drawing water from the well, He reached into the past of this sinful woman. As He taught her, and she understood not, He said: ''Go, call thy husband, and come hither." "T have no husband," said she. "Thou hast well said, I have no husband," He replied. "For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband." If the 25/ Geikie, p. 489. 26/Gen. 12. 27/ Gen. 32:28; 33:18. 28/ Joshua 8:32; Deut. 27. 29/1 Kings 12; id 12:25. 476. 33/ Joshua 24:26. 30/ Joshua 24:32. 34/ Deut. 27:4 ff. 35/ Geikie, p. 483. 31/ Gen. 12:6 ff A.

And did He vision, as at twelve He now first beheld the well mortally, the future meeting with the woman and His sermon on the living water?" But whether the pilgrims stopped at Samaria or at Shechem, or whether before they reached there or after, yet as they went on towards Jerusalem along the Roman road, they passed constantly the places where other great happenings in Israel's history took place. About halfway, going southward, between Shechem and Bethel lies Shiloh. It was here that Joshua came with the Tabernacle and Ark after he left Gilgal, and it was here that he cast lots for the division of the Promised Land among the tribes." It was from Shiloh that the Benjamites (following the terrible punishment inflicted upon them by Israel for the abuse of the concubine of the Levite), stole the dancing virgins for wives. Here lived Eli and here was trained Samuel; and to Shiloh came the Philistines, and defeated the sons of Eli and carried off the Ark." As the group moved southward from Shiloh towards Bethel, there would likely come to them, increasingly as they neared Jerusalem (for under the Rabbinical law every male Jew over twelve years living within fifteen miles of Jerusalem was obliged to attend the Passover)," other pilgrims to the Temple and the great feast. And ever as they marched forward over the Roman highway, they would be chanting the sacred Psalms. On the right, to the westward, shortly after the group left Shiloh, lay the old Ephraimite Gilgal, whence went Elijah and Elisha on their way to the Jordan before Elijah was taken into Heaven." From a hill at the side of a wild pass a little farther south, they could look back and still see Mount Hermon with its cap of snow." As they went down the other side of the pass, they traveled through great orchards of fig trees and olives. This was the rich tertitory of Ephraim." And then came Bethel, a great sanctuary. Abraham came to Bethel from Shechem, and again after his return from Egypt. On his first visit he built an altar, to which he returned after Egypt. It was here that Israel assembled when they determined to war on Benjamin for the violation of the concubine of the Levite." It was here also that, after the rebellion of the Ten Tribes, Jeroboam set up one of the two golden calves he made for them to worship, the other calf went to Dan." One can but wonder how shallow must have been Israel's conversion to the true God, to be so easily turned back to Egyptian idolatry. Jehu left the calf though he rooted out Baal," but Josiah broke down the altar and "stamped it small to powder."" To the west and slightly to the south of Bethel, was Ai, and still 40/ John 4:7 ff. 41/ Joshua 18 ff. 42/ Judges 19, 21. 43/1 Sam. 4:10 ff. 44/ Geikie, p. 183. 45/II Kings 2. 46/ Geikie, p. 468. 47/ Geikie, p. 467. 48/ Gen. 12:7; 13:4. 49/ Judges 20:17. 50/1 Kings 12:28 ff. 51/II Kings 10:24 ff. 52/II Kings 23:15. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS further south, Ramah and Gibeon. Between these two latter Joshua fought the great battle against the Amorites, when, the day waning, without time to finish his victory that great warrior cried out, "In the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.... So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.' The growing group was now near Michmash, too, close to where Jonathan with only his armorbearer put to rout the Philistines, for Jonathan had said: "It may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.'" Still nearer to Jerusalem was Gibeah, the site of the shameful deed of Benjamin, and the home and headquarters of Saul while he was king." The pilgrims were now in the environs of Jerusalem. If they reached there just before the Passover, they found the roads choked with the tens of thousands who were coming to the City of David to attend the feast, bringing with them their burnt and peace offerings, for none might appear empty. In Jesus' time as many as 256,000 lambs were slain for the Passover. The population of the city at Passover time varied from 2,500,000 to 3,000,000. Many who came camped outside the city; others found quarters within the city walls with friends or relatives who hospitably took them in, the guests leaving, as they took their departure, 53/ Joshua 10:6 ff. 723 "the skins of the Passover lambs and the vessels they had used in their sacred services"; still others went to neighboring towns, Bethpage and Bethany being mentioned in the Talmud as especially hospitable. The shouts of greeting that passed between old friends again meeting; the chanting of the sacred psalms by the coming worshipers keyed to a high pitch by their long journey of anticipation, their presence in the city of the fathers, the nearness of the Passover, and the gratitude for their ancient deliverance; the lowing of the cattle brought for burnt offerings; the bleating of the sacrificial lambs; the cooing of the doves for peace offeringsall must have mingled into a babel of sound never to be forgotten, and heard from afar it must have been like the roar of a distant waterfall. We must believe that Joseph and Mary, and the youth Jesus, of the royal lineage of David, had awaiting them somewhere a joyous welcome from friends honored in the chance to give them food and shelter. One cannot escape the question whether they went on to Bethany, eastward of Jerusalem, for their lodgings, to the home where in the years to come Jesus spent so many happy hours in an abode that loved and honored Him. Did the youth Jesus know the youth Lazarus, and the maidens, Mary and Martha? Or did they go to Bethlehem, where twelve years before the Messiah was born in a manger?

Places Jesus Loved Elder Thomas Cottam Romney President of the Central States Mission PALESTINE, or as it is frequently called, the Holy Land, is the most charming bit of territory in the entire world to the followers of Christ. There are countries more picturesque if by that term is meant mountain peaks whose castellated formations pierce the azure to dizzy heights with peaceful lakes nestling at their feet; go to Switzerland for such. If, however, you long for gently rolling hills and peaceful countryside and shady lanes, visit England and feast upon her beauty and dream of romance. But if you want to feel the thrill which comes from standing on holy ground, consecrated and sanctified by the life and sacred blood of the Master, make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. As you approach the Jordan River from the east, you will be breathless with emotion, not of the hilarious type, but the deep, reverential emotion such as one would experience if he were approaching the sacred precincts of a holy temple. A feeling akin to that felt by Moses as he came upon the burning bush out of which he heard the voice of Jehovah commanding: "... Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground;" or even that which almost overcame Israel as they came near the sacred Mount of Sinai amid the thunderings of that holy mountain. Follow the Jordan to where it enters the Sea of Galilee from the north and you will witness, as you behold that expanse of water, one of the most enchanting pictures Page 724 of all of the multifarious designs etched by Mother Nature to please the artistic taste of man. No place in Palestine was more loved by Jesus than the Sea of Galilee. It was here around the borders of this inland sea that His time was chiefly spent in preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. It was from the fishing boats so abundant on the bosom of the lake in those days that the Master invited Peter and Andrew his brother and James and John, the sons of Zebedee, to leave their nets and come and follow Him "and I will make you fishers of men." 'To the publican Levi or Matthew, who sat at the receipt of customs in the city of Capernaum he said: "Follow me. And he arose and followed him." It was here that Jesus wrought His first miracle, if we -accept the testimony of the synoptic writers. In the synagogue at Capernaum on the Sabbath Day a man with an unclean spirit cried out: "... What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth...? And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him." And the evil spirit obeyed. The landscape of Galilee has remained unchanged throughout the centuries since the Savior looked upon it, save for the thriving cities nestled around its shores. All have disappeared but one and that is Tiberius, a gentile city whose origin antedated the birth of Christ by a quarter of a century. Capernaum, Bethsaida, Chorazin and the other PLACES JESUS LOVED Courtesy Publishers Photo Service LOOKING ACROSS THE SEA OF GALILEE FROM TIBERIUS seven or eight cities have passed away and only a few ruins remain to bear witness that they once stood there by the sea. These ruins forcibly remind us of the prophetic nature of the Son of God when he declared: "And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which were done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day." "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works, which were done - in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes." Speaking of the thriving conditions around the shores of Galilee and its environs in the days of Christ, Dr. Fosdick says: 725 Here in the Master's time ran trunk roads, with busy traffic passing to and fro and tax gatherers sitting at the customhouses to collect the tolls. Here were cities which he could compare with Tyre, Sidon and Nineveh and from which, as public attention centered in him, a great multitude followed him and they thronged him.... Here on the shores were fleets of fishing boats, and on the shores, miles of nets to be dried and mended. Everywhere about the lake the Master moved in the midst of populous, opulent, cosmopolitan life where a man might gain the whole world and lose his soul and where at times the exacting throng so wearied him that he had to go apart and rest awhile. Contrast the present desolate appearance with such a picture of prosperity; but, aside from the dearth of population, the scene remains unchanged. As Mrs. Romney and I approached the sea from the north, we observed that the great profusion of flowers brought forth by the late 726 winter rains had disappeared and the grasses had turned to a deep brown under the persistent heat of the Palestinian sun. Yet there were colors in the landscape of a never-ending variety, from the deep green shades of the trees and brush to the purple colorings on the flank of the precipitous hills that rise sheer from the eastern shore of the Sea of Gallilee. Below, in front of us, we saw the placid waters of Galilee. Scarcely a tipple was to be seen on its bosom, so much in contrast to the picture portrayed by the synoptic writers in which we behold the Master stilling the tempest to save the lives of certain of His disciples exposed to the turbulence of the waves. Here in this body of water is typified the lesson of contrast. The water so calm and peaceful at one moment, in the course of a brief period may be a fury of waves capable of dashing into pieces the fisherman's sturdiest boat. Such was the testimony of a Palestinian who understood the fitful nature of this inland sea. While fish caught from the lake were being prepared for the midday meal, we were seeking respite from the oppressive heat by imbibing ice-cold soda pop and by fanning ourselves beneath the shade of trees adjacent to the edge of the lake. Not a breath of. Air seemed to reach us from the heights abovethe sea was a dead calm and not a leaf or blade of grass stirred, so still was the atmosphere about us. And yet, there was a fascination about this place, nearly seven hundred feet below the level of the sea. Perhaps it came from a knowledge that the Master had consecrated its shores with His divine presence and bathed His tired feet in its cooling waters. But robbed of its sacred historic connotations, it still would have a deep and abiding fascination for the tourist. The blueness of the water, the precipitous character of the limestone hills rising from the water's brink, the scattered thorn bushes all around the shore, and the blue sky overhead combined to produce a picture in nature which once seen, can never be forgotten. THE journey to Nazareth, twenty-five miles to the southwest, took us through the village of Cana where Jesus turned the water into wine at the marriage feast. Had we taken time, the very jars in which the water stood would have been pointed out to us, and maybe a sip of the wine would have been tendered us were we gullible enough to purchase it. Nazareth, the boyhood home of Jesus, is beautifully situated in a little valley and in the southern folds of the Galilean hills. From one of the highest points of the village can be seen the blue waters of the Mediterranean through a V-shaped valley off to the west. Upon this scene, no doubt, the Master as a youth was wont to gaze times without number. And down below was the plain of Esdraelon stretching from Mount Carmel on the west, to the Jordan on the east. Over this plain for thousands of years had been heard the tramp of footsteps of millions of fighting men from many parts of the world as they marched forth to battle. The clank of the sabre, and the whir of the chariot had been mingled with the groans and the shrieks of the dying as the soil drank the blood PLACES JESUS LOVED 727 Courtesy of President Joseph Jacobs. THE WAILING WALL AT JERUSALEM of myriads slain from Egypt and Assyria, from Babylonia and Syria, from the land of the Hittites and from Philistia and Moab. Caravans laden with goods from many parts of the world likewise used this plain as a thoroughfare of travel. Six miles from Nazareth, en route to Jerusalem, we passed on our left Nain, where Jesus raised to life the widow's son. A little farther on we beheld beautiful Mount Tabor with its symmetrical proportions rounded off like a hemisphere and covered with groves of oak and terebinths. Tradition points strongly to this Mount as being the scene of the transfiguration of Christ "... And his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light." Near the ancient city of Shechem we passed by the tomb of Joseph who was sold into Egypt and nearby was the traditional "deep well" from which Jesus was given water by the Samaritan woman. As we approached the city of Jerusalem from the north, we beheld a city sprawled over a desert area uninviting save to those who see beauty in an arid region. But to me, familiar with desert areas, there is a fascination and an allurement not to be met with elsewhere. The only natural source of water is an intermittent spring in the valley of Kidron insufficient to supply the city's needs. Cisterns have therefore been excavated from time immemorial for rain storage, and water has been led to the city by conduits from external sources, some of them far distant. Before entering the city, we could not refrain from visiting the Mount of Olives, a brief span to the east of Jerusalem. Over this Mount Jesus rode on His triumphant march into Jerusalem, and wept over the city as it came into view. Daily He must have passed over it during the time He lodged at the home of Mary and Martha before His trial and crucifixion. On its slope was probably the fig tree that He cursed and, at its foot and up its western slope was the Garden of Gethsemane where Christ was betrayed. It was likely on this Mount also that He gave His great eschatological discourse on the destruction of the Temple and the besiegement of Jerusalem in which He depicted the horrors which should overtake the Jewish people. And it was from here that He made His ascension into heaven.
The altitude of the spot on which we stood was 2637 feet above the level of the sea and 200 feet higher than the Temple mount. Toward the east and southeast we looked down into the very bowels of the earth, it seemed, and saw the Jordan River with its banks lined with trees and shrubs. We had a clear vision of the river to the point where it empties its water into the Dead Sea and, still farther on, we beheld that great inland body of salt water whose surface is 1300 feet below the Mediterranean. It was in the desert region to the west of the Dead Sea that Christ is believed to have spent His forty days in fasting, when tempted of the Devil.
Jerusalem has a population of more than 100,000. A portion of the city is new and splendid in all of its appointments while the old portion is much the same as it was when the Master trod its streets. The full-length, sombre gowns of the womenfolk as well as their headgear are reminiscent of the days of long ago when the Man of Galilee moved about the streets of this sacred metropolis. The camels and asses that thread the streets bearing burdens of merchandise and human freight could well be the progeny of remote ancestry that bore the burdens of Melchizedek, king and great high priest of Jerusalem, and his subjects at the time of the visit of Father Abraham on his way southward following the rescue of his kidnapped nephew Lot.
On the traditional spot where the temples of Solomon and Herod stood is the Dome of the Rock, one of the most impressive mosques of the Near East. Immediately under the Dome is a huge rock from which the mosque gets its name. On this rock is the imprint of what appears to be a human foot, the reputed footprint made by Mohammed at the time of his ascension into heaven. Near the Dome of the Rock is the Jewish Wailing Wall and to this spot come thousands of Jews yearly to pour out their souls in anguish in contemplation of the many disasters that have beset their race and with a prayer on their lips that the long period of exile from this promised land will soon end.
Bethlehem, where Jesus was born, is about six miles to the south of Jerusalem. It is beautifully situated on a ridge running east and west and commanding a splendid view of the surrounding country. The hills were somewhat more rugged than I had expected to see them and yet there was a peaceful beauty and quaintness about the whole landscape that was entrancing. The most interesting place in Bethlehem is the Church of the Nativity built by order of Constantine 330 A. D. at the suggestion of his mother, Helena. Within the Church is a star bearing the inscription, "Here Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary." About this spot hang costly lamps of gold and silver belonging to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Armenian Churches. While we rejected in our minds the historicity of this spot as being the birthplace of the divine Christ, it served to remind us that in this neighborhood came into the world the Only Begotten of the Father whose mortal birth we will soon be celebrating.
