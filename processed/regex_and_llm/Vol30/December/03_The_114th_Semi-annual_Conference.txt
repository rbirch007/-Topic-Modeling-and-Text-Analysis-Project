The 114th Semi-annual Conference Elder Richard L. Evans Member of the First Council of Seventy
A comparative estimate of a general conference would in many respects be meaningless, because conference is a combination of many elements, and because perhaps its greatest values are intangible. And when, each time a conference closes, one hears the frequent remark, "It was the best conference yet," it isn't just a thoughtless superlative. To those who so speak, it may be the best conferenceat least the best one they can remember. A particularly good meal of which we have just received a satisfying fullness is likely to be more acutely appreciated than a good meal of which we have partaken some time ago. And many felt that way about this conference.
Beyond the intangibles, however, there are some statistical bases of comparison. The attendance at this conference was, for example, somewhat smaller than attendance in the immediate past. This was to be expected. Many priesthood officers of the Church are in the armed forces of the country. Many others are pressingly engaged in defense industries and activities. Farmers are pressed for help more acutely than in past years. Transportation, both private and public, is circumscribed by more difficulties than many of us can remember its ever having been. All this combined to reduce attendancenotwithstanding which the main body of the Tabernacle was comfortably and impressively filled.
This was the fourth semi-annual conference of the Church at which attendance has been restricted since the United States entered the warrestricted in consideration of the overtaxed burdens of the people and restricted in cooperation with the general program of economy in travel and man power.
The sessions began on Friday afternoon, October 1st, with general sessions, six in all, continuing Saturday morning, afternoon, and evening, and Sunday morning and afternoon. All of the general sessions, except the Saturday evening session, were broadcast through the facilities of Radio Station KSL. The regular nationwide Sunday morning KSL-C. B. S. Broadcast from the Tabernacle occupied the first thirty minutes of the Sunday morning session. Two special meetings were held concurrently Friday eveningone for bishoprics in the Assembly Hall and one for Welfare chairmen in the Young Memorial Building.
President Heber J. Grant was in attendance much of the time, and had intended to speak, but, on the late advice of his physician, did not do so. President David O. McKay conducted all of the general sessions, and also read President Grant's message, which was one of blessing and reminderreminder that we are the architects of our own lives, and that no power anywhere can prevent any Latter-day Saint from being saved, except himself. The closing paragraphs of President Grant's talk follow:
As it was during our meetings last April in our annual conference, so today we have thousands of our young men in the armed forces of the warring nations. Constantly I pray that the Lord will bless each and every one, and that he will help each of them to live in accordance with the principles of the gospel, so that he may have a claim to the blessings of the Lord to the full extent that accords with his wisdom. I pray that, so far as it accords with the providences of the Lord, each of them may be preserved from accident, sickness, and death, to return in due course to his loved ones. I pray God to help them to stand up under the terrible strain which they must meet. I appeal to the Lord to bring the war to an end at the earliest possible date. Consequently my heart goes out in the deepest sympathy for the comforting influence of the Lord to be given to the fathers and mothers of the sons who are in the war at the present time. May the comforting influence of the Spirit of the Lord be given to them in carrying their burdens, and to bring solace to their yearning hearts. I am praying with all my heart and soul for the end of this war as soon as the Lord can see fit to have it stop, and am earnestly praying for the influence of the Spirit of the Lord to be with all who have loved ones in the war. I pray that the spirit of peace and of increased faith may pervade all the homes of the Latter-day Saints, and with all the power and authority I have to bless, I invoke God's blessing upon the Church as a whole and upon the honest in heart everywhere.
President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. reviewed some of the remarkable accomplishments of the Church Welfare program, gave an account of Church finances and their stewardship, spoke of the illimitable possibilities of this people if they would work in oneness of purpose; and differentiated between communism and the United Order. Some of the sentences from his talk follow:
Thus far in 1943 our tithes have increased over 1942 by more than fifty percent.
The United Order and communism are not synonymous.... Those who go about telling us otherwise either do not know or have failed to understand or are wilfully misrepresenting.
There has come into the Church an ever-increasing spirituality because of the giving which has been incident to the carrying on of the Welfare work.
The Lord told his disciples.... That they must be one, and that he expected his people to be one.
I am sure we have demonstrated in this Welfare program, and in the more or less auxiliary home canning, in what has heretofore been more or less of an experiment, what we can do, we of the Church, if we set our minds and our hearts on carrying out the admonition of our prophet in becoming self-sustaining.
We believe that if we included the canning done by Church families in the missions, the total number of cans of fruits and vegetables which we shall have in these three ways brought into storage for the next year, will approximate, if not exceed, 50,000,000 cans. This represents over 1,000,000,000 points.
President David O. McKay, in a stirring address of the Saturday morning session, spoke on "The Home Front." Social evils, selfishly restricted families, divorce, and the early training of children were among the subjects on which counsel and statistical fact were given. Said he:
Teach the young people that marriage is not merely a man-made institution, but that it is ordained of God....
It is the duty of everyone to strive to make it possible that no soldier now dreaming of a happy homecoming may return only to find a broken home or its ideals shattered by the sinful indulgences of a member of the family.
Life is too short and love too great to sacrifice one hour through pettiness.
The foundation of a happy home is laid during pre-marital days.
Seeking the pleasures of conjugality without willingness to assume the responsibilities of rearing a family is one of the onslaughts that now batter at the structure of the American home.
This was the first conference to present President George Albert Smith in his new capacity as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. President Smith's address cited the historical disasters that had come to generations and centuries of nations and peoples who have refused to repent, and the blessings and forgiveness that have come to those who have turned to the Lord. His sermon carried with it the spirit of these passages in the 23rd chapter of Matthew:
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Occasions have not been frequent in the Church when two new members of the Quorum of the Twelve have been presented at the same conference. This was one such occasion. Elder Spencer W. Kimball and Elder Ezra T. Benson were sustained by the upraised hands of the priesthood of Israel and responded to their calls with humility and in the spirit of dedication.
From Brother Kimball came this word:... I know that this is the Church and kingdom of God. It has been a part of me. Whenever it has prospered I have gloried in it. When it was criticized, it has hurt me, for it seemed a part of my very being. Every fibre in my body bears witness that this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness.
And from Brother Benson: It has been my glorious privilege to be blessed with wonderful opportunities in my life. But my happiest days have been those spent with the priesthood and the membership of this Church. *... More than anything else, besides my desire to maintain my testimony, I desire the love and confidence of the priesthood of this church, and I pray the Lord to give me strength that I may merit that love and confidence.
Those who listened by radio, and those who sat in the presence of these two new members of the Quorum of the Twelve, felt and knew that there are many good and wise and able men throughout the Church, and that the Lord had called two such to a high trust.
All the general authorities of the Church were present and presented messages. The space allotted here will not permit the recital even of the theme-sentence of eachbut there was a oneness of feeling about the entire proceedings; the addresses were uniformly thoughtful and satisfying and the conference was free from any jarring note or discordant thought. Fortunately, the entire (Continued on page 744)
