Teach Tithing In the Home. Presiding Bishop LeGrand Richards N the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood there is considerable attention given to the teaching of the law of tithing. Young men are taught that one-tenth of their increase belongs to the Lord. They are taught that this divine command from our Heavenly Father applies, with equal force, to each member of the Church, whether young or old. They are taught that income, not age, determines the obligation. Too frequently our youth grow up under the impression that the payment of tithing may, or even should be, deferred until maturity. Inquiry and observation reveal that in a great many cases Our young people become acquainted with the law of tithing for the first time in the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood or in the classes of the various auxiliary organizations of the Church. In such instances this means that they have never been taught tithing by their parents in the home. If they become acquainted with this law of the Lord, they must receive this information and training outside the parental home. This is not as the Lord would have it. The obligation for teaching young people rests first upon father and mother in the home. The quorums of the Priesthood and the auxiliary organizations of the Church serve as supplements and aids to the home, but in no way relieve parents of their responsibility to teach their children to obey the commandments of the Lord. Failure to teach our sons and daughters to pay an honest tithe brings them under the Lord's stinging indictment "'... Ye have robbed me." Innocently they inquire, "Wherein have we robbed thee?" The reply, "In tithes and offerings" will prompt their plea of innocence but their guilt is none the less real. And all of this they suffer largely because parents failed them during the tender and impressionable years of youth. It is a safe conclusion that parents generally fail to teach their children the law of tithing because they themselves have not been obedient thereto. A father or a mother who pays an honest tithe is always proud to have sons and daughters know that this obligation has been discharged, and to have them do likewise. But the parent who pays little or no attention to this commandment frequently seeks to justify his disobedience by attempting to discredit the validity of this law of the Lord. He may even go so far as to discourage his children's obedience in order that he may experience the sinful comfort of companionship in disobedience. From various sections of the Church there are numerous examples coming to light which attest the effectiveness of the teachings of the Aaronic Priesthood quorums and other Church organizations relative to the law of tithing. Young men and young women whose parents have never paid tithing are faithful in returning one-tenth to the Lord. Still other parents have become converted to the payment of tithing when their sons and daughters have Page 307 308 set the example in th taithful dis- 'charge 'of 'this 'obligation. This is commendable but it does not justify the shift of this responsibility from the parental home to the Church organizations. It may some day be embarrassing for children to be obliged to give to the Church, instead of their parents, the credit for teaching them the law of tithing. It will be still more embarrassing when our Heavenly Father inquires of parents as to why they neglected this parental duty. Many children today, some young and some now grown to maturity, are being denied the great blessings attendant upon the payment of tithing because their parents did not teach them while in the home to obey this law. It is in this way that the Lord visits "... The iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation...." Surely, no parent can feel happy about his neglect when it means that his children are not entitled to the blessings they otherwise would have received had they been taught to pay an honest tithe. The ideal situation is for our young people to be properly taught and trained in the home to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, and then receive the supplementary teachings in the Priesthood quorums | and the auxiliary organizations of the Church. The home and the Church working unitedly together will accomplish a marvelous work and perform a. Noble mission in the training of the youth of Zion. One instance of this cooperation between the home and the Church reveals that sixty-six young men residing in two wards in the same stake, came up through the quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood where the law of tithing received its proper emphasis, and during their first year as ordained elders paid an average tithe of $77.12 each. These young men had faithfully paid their tithing during the years they served as deacons, teachers, and priests, with the result that when they were ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood the teachings of the home and the Church together had become an integral part of their lives. This is as the Lord would have it. This is the way we may bind Him to His promised blessings which He anxiously waits to pour out upon the faithful everywhere. May is here! The air is fresh and sunny; And the miser-bees are busy Hoarding golden honey. Thomas Bailey Aldrich.
