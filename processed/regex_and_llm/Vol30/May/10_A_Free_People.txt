A FREE PEOPLE Rose Adeana Openshaw Oh may that span and scope be reached Where captives cease to be! Oh may we conquer weakness and Indeed be people free! VYlotesd 10 THE FIELD Ussiting Seaching HE month of May concludes the 1942-43 Relief Society educational season. During the four summer months, June through September, no regular classwork is conducted, but the monthly work-andbusiness meeting and monthly visits by the visiting teachers should be continued as usual. As was indicated at the Relief Society general conference in October 1940, and included in Blue Bulletin No. 26, June 24, 1942, arrangements may be made for each visiting teacher to have one month free during the summer, if desired, by using substitute teachers or by having teachers go singly one or two months, as necessary. During the summer, visiting teachers may visit without discussing a uniform topic, or may take into the homes any special messages provided by the stake or ward. Where the stake or ward has no special message to present, visiting teachers desiring subjects suitable for discussion in the home are referred to TheSuch articles as the following might appropriately be used: "The Promise of the Gospel in Helping Us To Meet Present-Day Crises," President David O. McKay, March 1942, page 162; "Family Prayer," Ray R. McKay, April 1942, page 254; "Preserving Our Homes In Wartime," Mark K. Allen, July 1942, page 453; "Mental Health Through Recreation," Mark K. Allen, November 1942, page 770; "Brotherhood," Elder Harold B. Lee, February 1943, page 84; "Radio Address," President Amy Brown Lyman, April 1943, page 236. Visits of visiting teachers should be friendly and short, and timed as opportunely for the women in the home as possible. Ifa woman is very busy, it is recommended that visiting teachers merely inquire as to the well-being of the family, extend an invitation to Relief Society meetings or other functions to be held during the month, deliver very briefly any necessary message, and then leave, stating that they will spend more time on their next visit when she may not be so busy. Visiting teachers are cautioned about repeating startling statements that cannot be verified, or discussing sensational subjects based on rumor. All topics discussed in the home should be based on authentic information, and should be helpful and encouraging. This not only makes the visit more profitable, but makes the visiting teachers more welcome in the home. The recommendations of the General Board regarding visiting teaching requiring automotive transportation, issued early in 1942 and effective during the period while there is limitation of automotive travel, are repeated here: 1. That visiting teaching be continued as usual where districts are within walking distance; 2. That where districts are scattered such districts be sub-divided, wherever practicable to do so, so that a smaller number of families may be visited by perhaps only one visiting teacher who lives in the neighborPage 327 328 hood and is within walking distance of the families in such smaller districts; 3. That where distances make it impracticable for visits to be made, the unvisited members take their contributions to the regular Relief Society meetings; 4. That those stakes which print leaflets for visiting teachers to distribute in the homes might send such leaflets by mail to unvisited families, or that such families might be called by telephone where this service is available, but that such communications should: not be counted as actual visits. Directions for keeping track of communications which are made in lieu of regular visits are given in the instructions in the back of the new visiting teachers' report books, under the heading '""Communications in Lieu of Visits." One of the important duties of visiting teachers is to acquaint Latterday Saint women with the Relief Society program and to encourage participation in Relief Society activities. This is particularly important this year in areas where defense and war work have caused an influx of workers into the community, many of whom are Latter-day Saints and need to be brought actively into the work of the Society. Recent surveys have been made under the direction of ward bishops to identify new families living in their respective wards. 'The General Board recommends that Relief Society officers cooperate fully with their bishops in identifying and welcoming the Salvage VERY woman is anxious to do all in her power to help win the war and bring about peace. One effective way in which women may contribute to the war effort is to salvage materials that are so critically neededhousehold fats, tin cans and newcomers and in enlisting them as active members. Relief Society presidents are urged to procure from their bishops the names of new Latter-day Saint families to be added to the regular visiting-teacher list. When visiting these new families, special effort should be made to acquaint them with various Relief Society and other ward activities and to make them feel welcome. It is also suggested that visiting teachers notify the ward president, who in turn would notify the bishop, of any new Latter-day Saint families coming to their attention when making their regular visits. 'The opportunity Relief Society has for contacting the wives in the new households in every ward constitutes one of the most important points of beginning in the entire Church program in the interest of new families moving into various communities because of defense work.; Relief Society visiting teachers hold an important position in the Relief Society organization. The effectiveness of their work is dependent upon their understanding of their duties and responsibilities, and the spirit and diligence with which they meet these responsibilities. 'The General Board sincerely appreciates the splendid efforts of Relief Society visiting teachers.

Depots have been arranged at stores for collection of fats, hosiery, and phonograph records. Local sal-
