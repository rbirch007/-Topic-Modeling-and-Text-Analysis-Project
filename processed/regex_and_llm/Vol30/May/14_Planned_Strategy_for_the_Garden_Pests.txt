Planned Strategy for the Garden Pests Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, The Deseret News FTER the spring planting has all been done and the garden has begun to put out fresh new growth, then trouble usually creeps in like the proverbial villain in the play, to try the heart and spirit of the home gardener. All during the hopeful spring planning and planting season the garden pests have lain in wait until some choice favorite plant would be spreading its beautiful green leaves, perhaps even showing a few promising buds. Only then do the exasperating insects attack like some vile thief in the night, and they often do great damage before the unsuspecting gardenmaker discovers their presence. Every home gardener must anticipate this annual invasion, for seldom do gardens escape being attacked by one or another of the common garden pests. 'There is no use. To wring one's hands and lament the matter, we must meet such a common emergency with a fighting spirit. We must be prepared with a planned program of defense by having modern spray equipment ready and waiting to drive the invaders out as soon as they appear. We must arm ourselves with the wherewithall for making a fighting stand, for preparedness and perseverance are two-thirds of the battle in fighting these troublemakers. Page 334 Most of these common garden pests come under one of three types: there are the chewing insects, the sucking kinds, and the fungous spores and other plant diseases. If you suddenly discover some plant is being eaten, either the foliage, buds, or tender stems, then you can be sure that you are entertaining one of the chewers (and these come in many fancy sizes, shapes, and forms). The cure for this type of pest is poison spread over the entire plant, foliage, buds, and stems, so that no matter where Mr. Bug next chooses to dine, he will find a dose sufficient to stop his career of crime. This can be applied by means of either a liquid spray or in powder form, spreading the powder with a dusting gun. Arsenate of lead is the chemical usually employed in most spray preparations for control of the chewers, although pyrethrum and Paris green are also used. The sucking insects present a different problem for they do not eat the foliage, but thrust a long proboscis or beak into the tender juicy new growth and suck out the very life blood of the plant, its sap, causing it to wither and often even die. The suckers are usually very small, the commonest being the plant aphis, stealthy creatures of great ingenuity who congregate on the underside of the leaves, the stems, and in the crevices. These mild-appearing but PLANNED STRATEGY FOR THE GARDEN PESTS murderous small insects increase at such an alarming rate that unless something is done to control them, they often completely ruin an entire year's crop. But the poison spray which is so effective against the chewing insects is useless in fighting this type. Instead of poisoning them, we must apply a product which will kill them by suffocating them with poison fumes. Nicotine is the usual cure, and it too is available in either liquid or powder form and under many different trade names. The fungous diseases require dusting with sulphur or copper to control bacteria or fungous growth such as mildew, the plant disease which so often attacks roses, and other plants, spreading its gray powdery mass over foliage and stems, causing disfigurement. Fortunately for the home gardener, there are now several preparations which contain all three of these different types of insecticides so that one can use one spray for the control of all garden pests. 'This is the most practical method for the amateur, and the one which gives best results. Reliable nurserymen can supply such all-purpose sprays that will do the trick if they are used early in the season, and even before the pests have made their appearance. It is the same old story of an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure. If a spraying or dusting program is carried out at regular intervals during the year, it is quite possible to keep any garden free from insect damage. But the gardener must apply the remedy thoroughly and early, followed by other applications, especially in the case of the sucking types. 335 The dusting gun is most popular with many gardeners because this is so easily used, and this should be equipped with a long extension rod so that the dust may be applied from the ground upward to reach the underside as well as the upper leaves. The dust spreads out in a cloud, reaching more surface than the liquid spray. Such a dusting gun can be purchased for the sum of one dollar. Here are a few rules to help the gardener to have a pest-free garden: 1. Keep the garden well raked and tidy; many pests live and hide underneath old trash, boards, or wood left lying about. 2. Purchase rust-proof and _ wilt-proof seeds of many annuals and vegetables as offered in catalogues. 3. Do not crowd the plantings, but allow plenty of air between plants. 4. Rotate the different crops each season; certain pests attack only certain crops, and by moving crops about the diseases. Or insects that live over in the soil will be avoided.. Do not water roses in late afternoon or night, this encourages mildew. 6. Keep out of the garden when plants are wet, for mildew and other fungi will cling to clothing and be spread when wet. 7. Cultivate the surface regularly, this destroys many pests. Wi HERE are a few other common "plant and garden pests which require other methods, the commonest being the grasshopper which has been so troublesome of recent years. This pest is best handled by spreading a poisoned bait, a new product called Bug-Geta being easily used to fight not only grasshoppers, but cutworms, sowbugsthe small flat creeper which rolls itself up into a round ball when disturbedsnails, slugs, and weevils. 336 The lover of gladioli should also be well prepared with a spray to use in the control of thrips, the insect which causes such havoc in this beautiful flower. One can do much to fight this pest by soaking the bulbs for eight to ten hours in a solution of one quart warm water to one teaspoonful of lysol, just before planting. But in addition, one must spray with a solution made by mixing one heaping tablespoon of Paris green, two pounds of brown sugar or any sweet syrup, and three gallons of water. 'This spray should be used as soon as the leaves are about six inches high, and followed by two other sprayings a week apart. This will md any planting of this pest which so often ruins whole crops of flowers. Does all this seem a melancholy and distasteful business to one who starts out. To make beauty, and to grow pleasant and delicious vegetables? We admit that it is not the most enjoyable of the many garden jobs, but our complex modern life has brought pests from countries far and wide into our gardens, and only by taking a sensible attitude and by equipping ourselves to cope with them can we hope to escape pest troubles. Let us cheerfully include these few simple tasks as a regular part of successful gardening, just as weeding and watering are a necessary part of its upkeep. We can promise that the gardener will be well repaid for such efforts, especially if she will begin the program of dusting or spraying early before the pests have established themselves. We can well apply that old axioman ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and the rewards are great.
