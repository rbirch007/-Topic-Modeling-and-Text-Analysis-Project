NOTES TO THE FIELD vage committees arrange for periodic collection of other items. A small payment is made for fats and phonograph records which are turned in. It is suggested that some local Relief Societies may wish to handle collection of old or broken phonograph records from their members or others in the community, as a means of adding funds to their treasury while at the same time making available for use the valuable shellac for which the records are salvaged. ~ Information as to the collection of these various items may be _ obtained 329 from your local salvage committee. The demand for these materials is becoming greater each day the war goes on, and to meet the demand the aid of every individual on the home front is solicited. The Relief Society desires its members throughout the United States to cooperate fully with their respective salvage committees by announcing in Relief Society meetings the collections which are conducted from time to time by their local salvage committees, and by individually supporting the various salvage collections as they are conducted. Summer Program of Primary Association HE Relief Society General Board commends the Primary Association upon the splendid program it is conducting for children, particularly during the summer months when children are not in school and have time on their hands, and when they are working in fields and orchards and need the relaxation that comes from directed play or other activities. 'The program for the current summer quarter features profitable activities of many types, each ward being allowed to select the acPamphlet Available, tivies best suited to its needs. Children as well as adults are affected by war conditions. During war periods it is particularly important that they be given opportunity to participate in interesting, profitable, well-directed activities such as the Primary Association provides. The General Board. Recommends that Relief Society women wholeheartedly support the Primary program, and that they use their influence to have children attend regularly. 'How FRO) Vin on the Home Front ' HE General Board has on hand, T through arrangements made by the National Council of Women, a quantity of pamphlets entitled "How to Win on the Home Front," issued in 1942 by the Public Affairs Committee, Incorporated. The pamphlet contains valuable information for the homemaker during wartime on such important subjects as: Scarcity, Higher Prices, Poorer Quality; The Rules of WarRationing, Quality and Standards, Credit Control, Taxes and War Bonds; Home Front StrategyA Plan of Action, Budgeting for Health, Stretching the 330 Food Dollar, Clothing and Miscellaneous Items, Housing Upkeep, and Going Places and Doing Things. Relief Societies desiring to do so may use this pamphlet as the basis for discussions in summer work-and-business meetings. The information contained in this pamphlet has been obtained largely from the publications of the Bureau of Home Economics of the Department of Agriculture, the Consumers' Guide, and Consumer Tips of the Consumers' Counsel of the Department of Agriculture, and official releases of the Office of Price Administration. Information on taxes and savings came from the United States Treasury. Due to the necessity of changes in rationing and the government price control program, some of the information on these subjects is not now current. Nevertheless, the pamphlet contains much valuable information. Although first made available at ten cents each, a limited supply of these pamphlets has been made available to Relief Society without charge. As long as the supply lasts, the General Board will meet requests for copies from Relief Society officers or members. Address requests to the General Board of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City, Utah. Potitions on Informative Labeling N Blue Bulletin No. 29, issued December 29, 1942, the General Board suggested that all Relief Societies in the United States cooperate with the National Council of Women in petitioning the Office of Price Administration to require that goods bear informative labels clearly stating what an article is, of what it is made, what service it will give, and how it should be cared for. Signed petitions were to be sent to the National Council. The Relief Society is highly commended for its efforts in this important matter in a letter recently received by the General Board from Charlotte Payne, Executive Secretary of the National Council. The following quotations are from Miss Payne's letter: You should have had a dozen letters in the past month because each mail has brought such enthusiastic response to the request for signatures on the petitions that we just beam at the very mention ofthe Relief Society! I think that a fair estimate of the number of signatures which we have had from your wards would be about 9,000 covering 33 states with almost 5,000 from Utah alone. We cannot tell you how proud and pleased we are with this evidence of your interest and cooperation. You know that we plan to present the petitions to Mr. Prentiss Brown. Meanwhile, our efforts along this line have already produced results. The recent stocking regulation is the first one in which informative labeling is a part of the requirement. Miss Payne further states that when a meeting is arranged with Mr. Brown, a Relief Society representative will accompany the group. "This," she states, "seems only fair since Relief Society has taken so active a part."
