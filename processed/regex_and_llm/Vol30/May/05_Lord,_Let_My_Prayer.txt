LORD, LET MY PRAYERS FOR OTHERS BE Irene R. Davis My soul, oppressed, sought Thee to tell My secret needs and woes. And still I groped and strove in dark; to find That I was lost, and hope was blind. In vain I prayed, my heart outpoured! I somehow failed to reach Thee, Lord. I prayed for wisdom. Now I see, My prayers were always prayers for me. My woes and needs and cares came first; No thought to slake my brother's thirst; Lord, let my prayers for others be; Perhaps someone will pray for me. PRESIDENT AND MRS. HEBER J. GRANT PRESIDENT AND MRS. HEBER J. GRANT OBSERVE. WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 'THIS, the latest picture taken together of President and Sister Grant, is a hitherto unpublished one. With its publication, the General Board, on behalf of the entire membership of the Relief Society, congratulates this distinguished and revered couple upon arriving, on May twenty-sixth, at the fifty-ninth milestone of their married life. This photograph, taken in the out-of-doors in which they both delight, reflects an alert expression on both of their faces, showing that at the age of eighty-six they still enjoy life to the fullest. It is our heartfelt desire that they may continue throughout their lives to enjoy health and happiness. Page 306
