KEYS Clarence Edwin Flynn It is a shame upon us That there should be a day When we must seek protection By locking things away. If but the race were honest, One could leave any store By day or night, with never A lock upon the door. He could lie down to slumber Unhindered till the dawn, Knowing no hand would harm him, Or anything be gone. Perhaps we shall be neighbors Again in years to be, So honest that no coffer Or house will need a key.
