Inter-Continental Conference of the National Council of Women Priscilla L. Evans Member, Relief Society General Board Corresponding Secretary, National Council of Women Inter-Continental Conference of the National Council of Women of the United States and of the National Council of Women of Canada was held Mon- - day, Tuesday, and Wednesday, May 6, 7, and 8, 1946, at the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. President Belle S. Spafford and two members of the General Board of Relief Society, Edith S. Elliott and Priscilla L. Evans, were official delegates representing the Relief Society ' at the Conference. Eighteen members of the Relief Society residing in New York Stake,* and one member residing in Washington Stake' attended one or more sessions of the Conference, some as accredited delegates and others as interested observers. This is believed to be the largest representation of Relief Society at any session of a conference of the National Council. The National Council of Women is a voluntary association of self-governing women's organizations through which is made possible an interchange of ideas, experience, and factual information on a nationwide scale. The Council was founded at a meeting held in Washington, D. C., during the year 1888. The first president of the Council was Frances E. Willard; the first vice-president, Susan B. Anthony. Among the pioneers who helped to form the Council were May Wright Sewall and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. At this historic first meeting, the Relief Society was represented by Emily S. Richards. Three years later, in 1891, at the first triennial meeting of the Council, on the advice of President Wilford Woodtuff, Relief Society became a charter member of the National Council of Women of the United States, and still continues (1946) as a member, and, through membership in_ the National Council, enjoys official contact with the International Council of Women.

The National Council does not itself sponsor activities of a controversial nature, but it does supply data to its members regarding the activities of other members. No member can, in any case, be committed to any cause or project by Council action except by its own vote. Although the Council continued to function during World War II, no national conventions were held, and, upon termination of the war, it was decided to call an Inter-Continental Conference. Mrs. Edgar D. Hardy, President of the National Council of Women of Canada, and Mrs. Harold V. Milligan, President of the National Council of Women of the United States, shared the responsibilities of the Conference and alternated in presiding at the various sessions. The theme of the conference was "Women and The New World: The Practice of Peace." At the opening session, the invocation was pronounced by Mrs. Ella A. Boole, President, World Women's Christian Temperance Union. It was a kindly and gracious act to recognize Mrs. Boole in this way. She is very aged, indeed, nearing the century mark, but alert and still courageous. She has, all her life, worked for the cause of temperance and has valiantly and militantly fought against what she characteristically terms "the demon rum." In conversation with the writer, Mrs. Boole recalled her affection for the Mormon women who early represented the Relief Society in the Council, speaking particularly of Emmeline B. Wells and Emily S. Richards. Mrs. Boole has always recognized the Church and: its authorities as strong allies in her temperance work and expressed pleasure in meeting Sister Edith Smith Elliott, a daughter of President George Albert Smith, whom she said she valued as an outstand-. Ing advocate of the cause so dear to her heart. The prepared addresses on each program during the three-day conference were presented in the form of panels, followed by discussion from the floor. The panel groups made arresting and colorful pictures. At one of the sessions, the occupants of the places at the long table across the platform were women from many countries. Mrs. Hardy, who was presiding, "called the roll of the continents," and the following responded: North America Senator Cairine Wilson of Canada South America Senorita Minerva Bernardino. Asia Madame P. H. Chang Australia Miss Doreen Berry Europe Madame Jan Papanek Africa Miss Eugenia Holmes McArthur To picture just one: Responding when Africa was called, was Miss Eugenia Holmes of Liberia, a pretty, INTER-CONTINENTAL CONFERENCE slight figure, faultlessly dressed in a becoming frock of cream-colored linen, which accentuated her very dark skin and eyes. Her coal-black hair was dressed high. She wore no hat, but instead had pinned a dark red rose in her hair. In responding to the panel subject, "The Challenges To The Peace Of The World," she spoke, in a well modulated voice, a very correct English. Her preparation was thoughtful and intelligent. On a succeeding panel, Miss Tove Elias-Nielsen, journalist of Copenhagen, Denmark, read her short message in halting, measured phrases. She prefaced the reading with the remark, "I have never before tried to speak to an audience in English. I have stayed up all
