Westward March of America Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, February 18, 1947 OMEONE has said, "In the making of the West, America was made." There is much of basic truth in this statement. At the close of our war for freedom, one main way was open for Americans. 'That was the open spaces of the West. Free land was there opportunity for expansion, for development. In taking the challenge, the realm was populated and more than this, a distinctive American character was developed. Intrepid pathfinders led the way. These were followed by missionaries and home builders. It was a mighty march westward of youthful spirits. Men, rather naturally, are given first place in this bold adventure. Yet women hold high place in the constructive conquest of our western realm, even from the very first. Recall here the young red mother who piloted Lewis and Clark across half our continent. Like Pocahantas, whose friendliness and human understanding did so much to save the first struggling Virginians from disaster, the "Bird Woman" added the needed guidance and practical help that brought success to the exploring captains. Her story brightens that great adventure. A Shoshone girl, stolen by the Blackfeet, she had been taken down the twisting Missouri for nearly a thousand miles, and sold into slavery. Later on, she became the wife of a French trader. Just after her first babe, whom they named Baptiste, was born, Lewis and Clark came to winter in the land of the Mandans where she lived. Learning that this Shoshone girl for she was only sixteen knew the way across the "shining mountains," they hired her husband as guide. He knew nothing of the route farther West, but his intelligent young wife did. Edna Dean Proctor, whose poems vibrate with the spirit of America, created a lyric to the "Bird Woman" ?from which the following lines are taken: Sho-sho-ne Sa-ca-ga-we-a ? captive and wife was she On the grassy plains of Dakota in the land of the Minnetaree: But she heard the west wind calling, and longed to follow the sun Back to the shining mountains and the glens where her life begun. So, when the valiant Captains, fain for the Asian sea, , LESSON DEPARTMENT Stayed their marvelous journey in the land of the Minnetaree... Glad she turned from the grassy plains and led their way to the West, Her course as true as the swan's that flew north to its reedy nest. Ee ee Straight she was as a hillside fir, lithe as the willow-tree, And her foot as fleet as the antelope's when the hunter rides the lea; In broidered tunic and moccasins, with braided raven hair, And closely belted buffalo robe, with her baby nestling there. Zee %e & To Missouri's broad savannas dark with bison and deer, While the grizzly roamed the savage shore and cougar and wolf prowled near; To the cataract's leap, and the meadows with lily and rose abloom; The sunless trails of the forest, and the canyon's hush and gloom; There, by the valiant Captains whose glory will never dim, While the sun goes down to the Asian sea and the stars in ether swim, She will stand in bronze and richly brown as the hue of her girlish cheek, With broidered robe and braided hair and lips just curved to speak; And the mountain winds will murmur as they linger along the crest, "Sho-sho-ne Sa-ca-ga-we-a, who led the way to the West!" Latter-day Saints generally may not know how closely the story of our pioneering is linked with this fine Indian mother. When she did rejoin her own people near what is now Armstead, Montana, the happy reunion was saddened with the word that her father and mother and a sister had passed away during her years of captivity. "Where is my sister's baby boy?" she asked. An Indian lad was brought to her. Gathering him in her arms, she adopted him for her own. Basil, as he was called, grew through the years to become finally a sub-chieftain of 779 the Shoshones under Washakie; and, like his leader, he was an unfailing friend of the Mormon people. According to Dr. Grace Raymond Hebard, who wrote a scholarly biography of Sacajawea, Basil was probably one of sixty-five Indians who were baptized into the Latter-day Saint faith at Fort Lemhi in the 1850's. According to Dr. Hebard also, the "Bird Woman," tiring of her French husband's cruelty and neglect, finally left him and found her people in Wyoming, where she spent her last days, exercising, with Washakie and Basil, her influence for peace and uplift. Another Indian heroine who played a stirring role in the westward march of America, was the wife of Pierre Dorion, the French guide of the Astorians. With two little sons, she made the man-testing journey from St. Louis to the Pacific. On the way another child was born to her, but it lived only a week or so. Later, when her husband and other trappers fell victims on the Boise River to red enemies, this devoted mother, escaping the massacre, fled with her boys to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. There, slaying the one horse she had, using its hide to help shelter them against the winter storms, and its meat to keep them alive, she waited until spring opened the passes. Finally, she crossed the range and found succor for herself and her boys with a friendly tribe. It was there that Alexander Ross, a British fur trader, found the courageous Mrs. Dorion. To him we are indebted for this story of mother courage and devotion; for he recorded it as she told it humbly to him. It is also told by Washington Irving in his Astoria, a literary history of high quality. Lure of furs was an impelling force that helped to chart the West. - Intrepid men, of the spirit of Jim Bridger, Peter Skeen Ogden, Jedediah Strong Smith, led in mapping ? the vast region between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific. Their purpose was to garner a wealth of furs; and this they did. -Yet beyond this they performed signal service in charting the unknown realm for the oncoming pioneers. Names of these heroic "mountain men," as they were called, still cling to streams, lakes and ranges of the West. Religion played its vital part in the lives of some of these fur seekers of the West. This is especially true of Jedediah Strong Smith? sometimes called the Puritan Pathfinder. He went into the wilds, it is said, carrying his Bible in one hand, his rifle in the other. It was he who first led a band of white men from the Salt Lake Valley into Southern California; and later, with two companions, dared to cross the Great American Desert eastward from the Sierras to what is now Central Utah. Indians later told our pioneers how these three white men, with only one. Horse, staggered into their camp at the south end of the Salt Lake. Six other animals with which they had left California perished in the desert. One notable result came of their adventure: it gave proof that this "Inland Sea" was not, as Jim Bnidger, its white discoverer, had first thought, an arm of the ocean. Another venture by white men half a century before Bridger and Smith had penetrated it, was made by Fathers Escalante and Dominguez. Seeking, with the help of Indian guides, a way from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Monterey, California, they came as far as the site of Provo; then, baffled in their quest, they prayed, drew lots, and finally returned to their mission home in New Mexico. They had charted, however, in part, what was called by the Spaniards, the land of the Northern Mystery. Still another intriguing story connected with the opening of the West is that of the quest of the Indians for the white man's "Book of Heaven." Through Jedediah Strong Smith, or some other God-fearing mountain man, they had learned about the Bible and wanted more of its uplifting stories. About the same year that the first Mormon missionaries were on their way to preach the gospel to the Lamanites on our western frontier, four chieftains of the Nez Perce and Spokane tribes came down the Missouri to St. Louis. There they were welcomed by General Clark, then Indian agent for the vast Missouri Territory. Their request for the "Book of Heaven" was not, at first, satisfied. Though the white folk gave them food and lodging and kindly treatment, the Indians did not get the spiritual message for which they had made the long journey. Two of the chiefs the older ones passed away while they waited; and were laid to rest in the frontier town. The next spring, with heavy hearts, the other two turned homeward. On leaving, one of them is reported to have said, in effect: You have so loaded us with gifts that our moccasins are heavy. But the light we  LESSON DEPARTMENT desired to take back to our people has not been given to us. We must still sit in darkness, Their plea did not fall: on deaf cars. Some devoted Christians finally heard and heeded it. From one of these, Jason Lee, came action. With his nephew, Daniel Lee, and another minister of the Methodist faith, he went westward with the fur seekers, and finally arrived at the Columbia in Oregon. There, missions were established; and the work of leading the red men into the light was begun. It yielded little so far as conversion of the Indians was concerned; but out of it came another fruitage the encouragement of American settlement of Oregon. Another response, with something of romance, came, in 1836, when two youthful missionaries, with their brides, took a long honeymoon trip into the far Northwest. These were Dr. Marcus Whitman and Henry H. Spalding. To their wives, Narcissa Prentiss Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding, belongs the honor of being the first white women to cross our continent. At its crest, it is said, they dismounted from their horses, set up an American flag, and kneeling down with their husbands, dedicated the West to God and home. These were to become the first white mothers in regions that later became the states of Washington and Idaho. To one of them, Narcissa Whitman, came, in 1847, the crown of martyrdom. With her stalwart husband, she fell victim to Indian savagery this, after they had _ established and maintained, through eleven years, a home that was at once a school, a place of worship, and of culture, and a center of 781 industry. Further, the Whitman Mission, now in process of restoration as a national shrine, was a haven of refuge for pioneers who came there weary and sick and needy on their last lap of the journey to old Oregon.. In We Must March, a stirring novel by Honore Willsie Morrow, we have the story, here sketched, graphically portrayed. Some question a few of the facts woven into it as not quite true to history; but it certainly is true to the spirit and lives of two courageous, devoted Americans. In Whitman an Unfinished Story by Dr. Penrose, President Emeritus of Whitman College, we have an historical presentation of the tale of devotion and sacrifice. Through the 1820's and the 1830's, the great West was largely charted, and missionaries gained a foothold in its wilds. Yet would the vast domain ever be brought under the Stars and Stripes? Could its mountain valleys, its deserts, ever be settled? Statesmen of vision, such as Daniel Webster, were ready to throw even old Oregon, to which, by discovery and exploration, America had first right, away to other nations. Of what use was that far-flung frontier to our country, anyway? An unmistakable answer came, in 1843, when a handful of American settlers in Oregon, with spirit like that of their Pilgrim and Virginia forebears, established a free government there under our flag. That same year a second clear answer rang out when one thousand men, women, and children, under heroic leadership and guidance, rolled over the Blue Mountains in their covered 782 wagons to a new homeland in the far West. Our East was settled largely by means of the waterways; our West by the wagonways. Praise should go to the humble ox teams which, patiently drawing homes on wheels, took mothers into the valleys of the mountains. Without these homemakers, the West never could have been peaceably conquered. Transcendent among those who made this constructive conquest were the home-seeking Latter-day Saints. By the time this particular lesson is being studied and taught, all our people, indeed all the world, will be at the beginning of the Centennial commemoration of the epic making march of the pioneer vanguard into a mountain-guarded realm. A theme is here for song and oration, story and drama, that will echo down the ages. Already much literature of true merit has been created portraying the heart and spirit of our pioneers the redeemers of the desert. Of all that yet has come, nothing surpasses in sweet simplicity and Bible-like fervor the splendid hymn that cheered their westward march "Come, Come, Ye Saints." In this song is the quintessence of true religion. Its first stanza is a vibrant note of joy and cheer, its second, a sweet expression of hope and trust in God; its third, a joyous look ahead to a peaceful happy homeland; its last a high note of true courage even to meeting death happily and triumphantly winning in the end. Daniel Stevens, a Nebraska leader who fell into possession of the site of the "Liberty Pole Camp" on the Elkhom River, where President Young organized the pioneer vanguard, was deeply impressed with the story of our home-seeking saints, and often told it to friends. "How in the world could those people stand the hardships and dangers?" he was once asked by an earnest listener. "Well, they thought that God was marching right by their side," was his reply; "and I am not so sure but that they were right." Discussion and Activities 1.
