Upon re-entering the White House, Mrs. Truman asked if the delegates would care to be shown some of the rooms. This courtesy was accepted, and, accompanied by an attendant, the group enjoyed an interesting hour. Mrs. Truman will ever remain in the minds of those present as a woman of refinement and charm. Her warm, friendly graciousness made the occasion a delightful one, long to be remembered. Good should grow out of this White House visit because, through it, one who mingles with those in high positions of state met typical Relief Society women and heard their wonderful story. Out of this should grow understanding, and the fruits of understanding are good. WORDS Dorothy J.
