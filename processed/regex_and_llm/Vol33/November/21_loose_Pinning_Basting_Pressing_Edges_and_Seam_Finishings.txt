Pinning, Basting, Pressing, Edges and Seam Finishings Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman For Tuesday, February 11, 1947 Objective: To assemble the garment, pin, fit, and baste. Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapters 12 and 13. INNING and basting are valuable aids in sewing. When a seam is pinned for stitching, the pins should be placed close together and set in from the edge, so they can be removed as you stitch. Put the pins in at right angles to the seam, pushing them in lightly from the edges. This will make a straight line guide for your basting, and will also keep the pins from pricking your fingers. When you start to baste your garment, first look to see how your pattern controls the curved lines. This means that you first prepare and then carefully pin in the darts, tucks, or gathers, then baste them, and try on the garment before stitching. Bastings are simply temporary joinings. They hold the pieces of fabric together for a fitting and they hold the seams together while you stitch. Fitting Too much fitting may not only distort the design, but may also take away the smartness, resulting in an uncomfortable, pinched - looking garment. Very little fitting should be necessary if the following points are emphasized:: 1. Take your measurements correctly. 2. Purchase the pattern in the correct size and, if alteration is necessary, do it carefully. Prepare the fabric and lay out the pattern pieces according to the instructions.. Cut and mark the garment carefully. Pin, baste, and assemble the pieces with precision. Pressing Good pressing equipment and careful handling of your garment are important. Press as you sew, is the first rule to follow. Press each seam and detail of a garment as it is finished, and before joining it to another part. This will help to make the final pressing much easier, and the finished model will be more professional looking. Pressing seams, using a sleeve-board and a tailors' cushion. Pressing woolens, steaming or pressing velvet, or other pile fabrics, are all arts of importance in sewing. Pressing is not difficult. The difficulty lies in. The fact that the average person does not realize the importance of pressing. Finishing Edges and Seams Edges and seams finished properly are a great asset to any garment. Edges may be overcast, pinked, bound, turned under and sewed with a running stitch, by machine or by hand, close to the turned edge, etc. Seam finishings may be French, felled French, hem felled, lapped, tucked, catch stitched, fagoted, hemstitched, or finished in any one of a variety of other ways, according to the requirements of the material and the time available for the seamstress. Assignment for March: Bring the garment you are making and the trimmings to be used. Of literature America as Revealed in Its Literature Lesson 5
