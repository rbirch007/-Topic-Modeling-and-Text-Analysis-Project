night practicing this for you." These incidents will illustrate the color, and, in some cases, the moving drama of the occasion. NE of the dramatic moments of the conference was at the opening of the first luncheon session. Mrs. Milligan, President of the National Council of the United States, was presiding. It is the custom in the gatherings of the Council, whenever food is served, to ask a blessing upon the food. Mrs. Milligan requested Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune to ask such a blessing. Dr. Bethune is the founder-president of the National Council of Negro Women and has been an active participant in Council affairs for many years. She stepped upon the platform, with her great spiritual strength shining in her black eyes, and in a beautiful, low voice, said, quietly, "Will you please repeat the prayer after me." And her white sisters bowed their 731 heads and repeated, phrase by phrase: "God bless this food to our bodies; God bless our bodies to service; God bless our service to all mankind. Amen." 'There were few dry eyes as Dr. Bethune stepped down and resumed her seat. The keynote address was delivered by Dr. Lena Madesin Phillips. She spoke to the subject, "Peace In The New World." Dr. Phillips is a lawyer by profession, is a former president of the Council, and is, at present, one of the vice-presidents of the International Council. Only a few excerpts from Dr. Phillips' address can be given in this article, but they will serve to give you the tempo of the entire conference. Running through all the addresses was an urgent plea for action not only to recognize the need to work for peace, but, as was reiterated time and again, "to do something about it." Dr. Phillips said: War in my judgment has two great taproots one of them is the economic root which denies to people food and security and jobs... I have told many audiences in this country that human beings will not starve, even for the Constitution of the United States. If you think that the economic situation does not influence people in their form of government, then you do not know the misery which is over the earth today. The second taproot is that which denies humanity those human rights of which we often talk. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from being discriminated against because of color or race or religion or sex?these things they desire. We can never have abiding peace until we pay more attention to these things. Two things I would leave with you. One is that we are living in a strange in-between time, between two worlds, the old world and the new. We have not come into the new world yet... I am not sure 732 that we are going to come into it very quickly... Second, I beg of you to go from here with a crusading zeal to try to get action, action among people you know, action from yourself about problems in our own country, about our relationship to the rest of the world. There is not much time... I think within the period of the next five or ten years we will see either great disaster or we will see the world come to a new realization of what really is the trouble with us... I believe it is something in the human heart and soul... It is selfishness, it is an apathy it is of course ignorance, but it is also the fact that we are not quite willing to pay the full price of peace.... God will not do for us what we are unwilling to do for ourselves, and so if we must have things as they were, then we won't have peace. It is only as we come to recognize the Christian ethics that we will find the way to peace. You are not only your brother's keeper, you are your brother's brother." Dr. Renee Girod of Geneva, Switzerland, was the guest of honor. Dr. Girod is one of the vice-presidents of the International Council of Women and acted as president during the war years when the president, Baroness Boel of Brussels, Belgium, had, as she herself expressed it, "a forced silence imposed upon her." Dr. Girod came by clipper plane from Geneva, and arrived in New York a few days prior to the conference. She is an interesting and impressive person. She addressed the delegates several times during the sessions of the conference, and each time the audience felt lifted up and strengthened. Her first message was brief, and was as follows: Dear Sisters: I think I may call you "sisters" because I feel very much at home in your country although I have been here three days only. I have come, as you have been told, from a very far away and very small country from Switzerland. But Switzerland, is the oldest democracy in the world and therefore I call you "'sisters" because all women in all the countries are sisters. If we have not felt it until now, we must feel it now very strongly because there is a terrific job lying ahead that is awaiting us. I am not going to speak on my own behalf now. I am just going to speak on behalf of Baroness Boel. She has given me a message for you, but this message is written in French so I shall read it in French first, and in case you don't understand it, I will do my best to translate it. It is rather difficult to translate Baroness Boel's French because it is rather peculiar. It is very good French but the better a language is the more difficult it is to translate. (Dr. Girod read the message in French and then translated it): It is with a feeling of pride for the large international movement that I represent that I asked Dr. Girod who, during those five years of forced silence imposed upon me, has assumed the charge of the presidency of our organization, to bring you my cordial greetings. I sincerely regret that circumstances outside my will have prevented my being with you today, but this is my message to all those who are meeting in this important conference of the Western Hemisphere. Whether members or not of the International Council of Women, I say' more than ever that the world needs the collaboration of women for the organization of a world with better justice. Women can and must bring their collaboration. More than ever does the world need the help of large women's organizations, those who like ours have for dozens of years worked for the emancipation of women and for the awakening of women's collective conscience, those created for the fine and special aims, those who are recently bor or who will be created tomorrow to respond to new needs. It is INTER-CONTINENTAL CONFERENCE through these organizations that woman makes her civic, political and international education. As citizens of her nation, her place is marked today beside the men, her brothers, men being grouped like she is in different parties which they have themselves formed. She has to accomplish her task with the man beside her. As citizen of the world, she has not yet been able to give the measure of her possibilities, she has not yet realized the young forces that are in her. As mother, she creates life. More than men, she has the duty to defend this life which she has given and of which she is the guardian, to defend not through a verbal pacifism which has given us, alas, many deceptions ?to defend not in turning her back to the danger when it comes. The women of the whole world have proved in the course of these last years what they are able to do to defend the liberties and principles that for them, as for their men companions, are more valuable than life. Women must defend those principles by bringing a loyal contribution to those who strive to construct a new international order, by suppressing war in the settlement of conflicts. The notion that none can do justice but oneself must pass from the individual to the nation. Then no state shall have the night to resort to force to settle a dispute. That is what all the women of the world want today, whatever be the spot of the planet on which they live. They must hold out for this high and strong today, strong in courage and enthusiasm. The large world associations can help them. Let us go forward, sisters, for this new crusade for the respect of human rights in a free world where, with the help of God, more justice and more love shall reign.. The end to be attained is worth all the efforts that have been made. OPPORTUNITIES were given during the Conference to present the work of the Relief Society to the delegates. At the executive 733 session on the last day of the Conference, President Spafford presented an exhaustive and well-considered report of the activities of the association, stressing especially the accomplishments of the war years. It was generally conceded by the delegates that no member-organization reported a more comprehensive program and certainly none could match the achievements of the Relief Society in aid to our European members through the Welfare Program. The facts were well and accurately stated, and the Relief Society representatives felt a justifiable pride both in the content of the report*and in its presentation by President Spafford. Sister Evans was called from the floor to the platform by Mrs. Milligan, President of the Council, who was presiding at the Wednesday morning general session, and, after a very gracious introduction, was presented to the audience as "a Mormon woman" and requested by Mrs. Milligan to "tell them something about the Mormon women and their work." Sister Evans, though taken entirely by surprise, was glad of the opportunity to give the delegates a word picture of the Relief Society, its beginnings and its purposes, its present strength, and its far-flung unit organizations. She spoke of the influence upon the lives of the Mormon women of the opportunity for leadership inherent in Relief Society organizations, and traced this influence into community, state, and national activities educational, cultural, political, and Church. On Monday evening, the Board of Directors of the Council met in executive session at the Cosmopolitan Club. This was an opportunity 734 to meet in an intimate, social atmosphere all the presidents of the member-organizations and the officers of the Council. Supper was served and the Relief Society delegates were assigned places at the head table, along with Mrs. Ambrose N. Diehl, the incoming president; Mrs. Harold V. Milligan, the outgoing president; Mrs. William Barclay Parsons, Jr., chairman of the Conference; and Mrs. Luella S. Laudin, chairman of the Committee on Human Relations of the Council. - Here again, great interest was shown in the Relief Society, especially in the international scope of its work. On the final day of the Conference, officers were elected to serve for the next biennium. Mrs. Ambrose N. Diehl was elected president, succeeding Mrs. Harold V. Milligan. Mrs. Frank Evans (Priscilla L. Evans) was re-elected corresponding secretary, and was appointed to membership on the executive committee of the Council. She has held these offices in the Council since 1938. As a fitting climax to the Conference, there was presented to the delegates, "A Manifesto." It was read to the conference by the well-known actress, Miss Jane Cowl. Her rendition was artistic and stirring. Only a few excerpts can be given here: A WOMAN'S MANIFESTO FOR ZERO HOUR This is the Woman's Hour... It comes at a fateful time when all humanity lies huddled in fear at the brink of a bottomless abyss. The curtain has fallen on a hideous epoch during which society, directed by only half the human family has recorded its unhappy history in the blood of countless millions and the tears of women who have borne the brunt of war, in every century. The testimony of man's failure to find the road to peace is there for all to read; it says, unmistakably, that having failed to solve the problems of wiping out wars, men have been driven inevitably to use instead ingenuity to increase their terror and ferocity. Viewing the cold facts from the broad perspective of history, it becomes obvious that human lust for power, selfishness, greed and the principle of "'might makes right" have prevailed as the dynamic of successive generations. But today, all of us, we members of the human family, wherever we may live on the earth's surface women and men, savage and civilized, colored and white, atheist and disciple of religion share the common threat of complete destruction in a man-made inferno. And at long last, women, liberated the world around, may speak out and give full expression to their natural role of peacemaker and protector; they may raise their voices in behalf of law and order and security against the machinations which lead to war.... Victor Hugo once wrote: "No army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come." 'The Idea is the strong chain of womanhood around the world which can be forged through friendship and mutual support to insure a lasting peace; and the Time is Now! To this end, the National Council of Women of the U. S., Inc., proposes the following as a rule of conduct every woman, everywhere, may adopt: I shall do all that lies in my power to fulfill the responsibilities of good citizenship in a world community: (1) by urging the active participation of qualified women in local, state, national and international government; (2) by using my ballot, always, for the benefit of the greatest number; (3) by protesting immediately to my government against any encroachment upon the 'human rights and fundamental freedoms of my global neighbors, anywhere; (4) by demonstrating in my home and my community, my firm belief in the precept of human brotherhood as the foundation of a lasting world peace. INTER-CONTINENTAL CONFERENCE This is the program I gladly adopt as the minimum of my obligation to society; but I shall seek, constantly, other ways of strengthening the hands of men and women of good will everywhere for the betterment of the human race so help me God. This Manifesto was unanimously by the assembled delegates, Throughout the Conference, there was a striking similarity in the thinking of the speakers. From the far corners of the globe came almost identical thoughts, with deviations only in considerations of customs and ancient traditions which must be changed slowly. Each speaker emphasized her conviction that we adopted 735 must think in terms of people, not nations, for it is people who are being deprived of human rights, and people whose wants can be satisfied only through the co-operation of other people. Again and again were reiterated the words: freedom, understanding, justice, integrity, cooperation and respect for the dignity of the individual. And always there came out of the heart of the speaker a spiritual note. Indeed, the pleas of all those participating on the program might be summarized in the words of the Savior: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets" (Mt. 7:12).
