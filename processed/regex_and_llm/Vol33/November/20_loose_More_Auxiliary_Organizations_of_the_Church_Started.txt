More Auxiliary Organizations of the Church Started Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, February 4, 1947 Objective: To study how the Sunday School, the Mutual Improvement Association, and the Primary organizations were soon given place to aid in the Church training program for youth. THE oldest auxiliary organization in the Church in this dispensation is the Relief Society. This came into being under the direct supervision of the Prophet Joseph Smith himself. In a previous lesson this year, the development of the Relief Society was treated. Mention again of this first Church auxiliary has significance in the light of other important auxiliaries which followed. From the very beginning, Joseph Smith visioned the expanding glories. Of Zion and knew that there would need to be helps in Church government. These helps we have come to know as the Church auxiliary organizations. Of them and their importance, the late President Joseph F. Smith has said: I have in mind our auxiliary organizations; what are they? Helps to the standard organizations of the Church. They are not independent. I want to say to the Young Men's and Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, and to the Relief Society, and to the Primaries, and to the Sunday Schools... And all the rest of the organizations in the Church, that not one of them is independent of the Priesthood of the Son of God, not any of them can exist a moment in the acceptance of the Lord when they withdraw from the voice and from the council of those who hold the Priesthood and preside over them. They are subject to the powers and authority of the Church, and they are not independent of them; nor can they exercise any rights in their organizations independently of the Priesthood and of the Church (Gospel Doctrine, page 479). Such a concept of the place of the auxiliary organizations of the Church should be readily accepted by Relief Society members. Their role as mothers and grandmothers has ever been one of helpfulness and understanding for the greater cause. No man has ever been truly great without the recognition of his mother's place in a climb to prominence. Nor is it true that his mother would ask for praise for a loving service so performed. She it is who finds her joy in having given the world a leader rather than in seeking satisfaction through words that eulogize her sacrifices. 774 In a Church sense, the auxiliary organizations do, in part, parallel a service not unlike that of a mother. They indirectly, but with effective guidance, aid in looking after the spiritual, mental, and moral welfare of Church members in their tender years. In the main, it is the youth of Zion that learns of the gospel by means of the Primary, the Sunday School, and the Mutual Improvement Associations. These attractive helps in Church government should not therefore be new in point of purpose to a Relief Society member. They can become, if supported and used, a much needed influence for guidance beyond the home. Blessings are to be gained by membership in all the auxiliaries, each one of which has purposely been planned to aid in the particular problems of an age group within the Church. In the early days of the Church, each willing worker who would thrust in his sickle found the personal joy of reaping a harvest of friends for the Lord. These could be visited often. The communion and fellowship resulting therefrom were intimate. By the time the saints had arrived in the valleys of the mountains, another phase in the development of the Church was reached. No longer could the members be looked upon as the "little flock," often so called by the Lord. Rather his people had become a modern camp of Israel, the correction and guidance of which called for organization. It was not long, therefore, until auxiliary organizations were needed to supplement the regular work of the Priesthood quorums. Three names will always be remembered in connection with the auxiliary organizations discussed in this lesson. President Brigham Young, Richard Ballantyne, and Aurelia ?. Rogers. It was to each of these leaders that the inspiration came to see the larger field for harvest, and the will to help reap the same. It should be mentioned, too, in connection with the M. I. A., that Brother Heber C. Kimball, in the early days of Nauvoo, saw the need of gathering the young people of the Church, and did so to provide instruction for them. In a sense, that forward-looking plan may be considered the early dawning of the Mutual Improvement work, though, true it is, that President Brigham Young brought our present-day auxiliary into actual being. On December 9, 1849, Richard Ballantyne gathered into his home some thirty children to start what later came to be the first Sunday School held in the Great Salt Lake Valley. Brother Ballantyne's purpose is expressed in his own words: I felt that the gospel was too precious to myself to be withheld from the children; they ought to have the privileges of gospel teaching and that was the main purpose, to teach the gospel. (Deseret Sunday School Handbook, page 8.) A year later, this Sunday School was given a permanent house in the old Fourteenth Ward meeting house with the first duly appointed superintendency under the Priesthood of God. Richard Ballantyne ? was named superintendent, with Joseph Horne and Phineas Richards, as assistants. From this humble beginning in 1849, the membership of the Sunday Schools in the Church has LESSON DEPARTMENT grown, in 1946, to 360,332 (Deseret S. S. Report, January 1, 1946). By means of the General Board, lessons and teaching aids are outlined and developed so that, today, a mighty Latter-day Saint Sunday School around the world meets each Sabbath day, sings the songs of Zion, marches to class for instruction, and voices, through prayer, the united joy of thousands of hearts. The Sunday School is one of the most important gospel-teaching organizations of the Church, and invites all, both young and old, to join its ranks. In the Thirteenth Ward of Salt Lake City, June 10, 1875, President Brigham Young organized the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association. He expressed the need for this organization as follows: We want you to organize yourselves into associations for mutual improvement. Let the key-note of your work be the establishment in the youth of individual testimony of the truth and magnitude of the great latter-day work; the development of the gifts within them that have been bestowed upon them by the laying on of hands of the servants of God; cultivating a knowledge and an application of the eternal principles of the great science of life. Each member will find that happiness in this world mainly depends on the work he does, and the way in which he does it. The present leaders of the Church look to this organization to teach the young people to develop the gifts within them; to express themselves before the public, to enable them to study and practice civil, vocational, social, scientific, and educational affairs; and also to train them in all that pertains to religious, moral, social, physical, and intellectual advancement. The auxiliary organization for the 775 children of the Church found its leader in a pioneer mother whose love of the beautiful in life and concern for the well-being of little children stirred her to action. At Farmington, Utah, in 1878, Aurelia S. Rogers organized the Primary Association.. She was set apart at this time to preside over this work. For some time... Sister Aurelia S. Rogers... Had reflected upon the need of a more strict guardianship over the boys and girls of Zion. She felt the necessity for more religious and moral training than they were then receiving; believed that children should be taught to beautify the home with the workmanship of their own hands, and learn to cultivate a love for music, for flowers, and for the beautiful in all things (Essentials in Church History, Joseph Fielding Smith, page 656). Today this Association has grown in numbers to over a hundred thousand. The responsibility of the organization, as stated by its present leaders is threefold: to give weekday religious instruction to the children of the Church; to supervise and direct their leisure time activities; and to encourage proper health habits. The auxiliary organizations of the Church today reflect the practical power of the gospel. 'The desire to share the good life has been made more than a dream. Faith has made works live among the Latter-day Saints. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion 1. Explain how the Church auxiliaries have helped the missionary work of the Church. 2.

Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 5 Industry President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, February 4, 1947 Objective: To acquaint the women with the diligence and industry of the pioneers two of their enduring virtues. BRIGHAM YOUNG in the Journal of Discourses, Vol 11, page 247, says: My experience has taught me and it has become a principle with me, that it is never any benefit to give out and out to man or woman money, food, clothing, or anything else if they are able-bodied, and can work and earn what they need when there is anything on earth for them to do. This is my principle and I try to act upon it. To pursue a contrary course would ruin any community in the world and make them idlers. Surrounded by nothing but wild and barren nature, and thrown upon their own resources, the pioneer women had to be industrious and invent ways and means of carrying on their share of the work. They spun and wove, and made their clothing and hats. They made their own brooms, candles, soap, and other household articles. They not only prepared the food, but they helped to produce it. They even helped to build their homes, as well as to raise the crops, and at the same time they reared large families. The writers own mother, when preparing her wedding dress, cleaned and washed the wool, carded it into rolls, spun the rolls into yarn, dyed the yarn in two shades with dyes she herself had manufactured, and wove this yarn into plaid cloth. She then cut the cloth by patterns she herself had fashioned, and completed what was truly a_ beautiful dress. Like many other women, she not only wove cloth for dresses and for men's suits, but she made shawls, bedspreads, and blankets. Old, worn, wagon covers, which had been made of "factory" in Nauvoo, were salvaged and made into men's shirts and other articles of clothing. Hats were made of straw which was bleached with sulphur found in the mountains. 'The straw was made into braids which were sewn together, then fashioned into hats by shaping on blocks, and pressing. The hats were then adorned with homemade trimming. It was the industry of the pioneers, who adopted the beehive as a symbol of industry for the Territory, which provided the means of sustaining life itself as well as supplying, in later years, many of life's comforts. Industry, as an integral part of the character of Latter-day Saints, is essential for the fulfilment of the prophecy of the Prophet Joseph Smith that the saints would become a great and mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains. .
