Observing a Principle of Prosperity Social Science Committee, Leone O. Jacobs, Chairman For Tuesday, February 25, 1947 "The earth is full and there is enough and to spare." Our Heavenly Father has provided well for his children upon the earth. The things which are necessary for our well-being have been placed here in abundance, and we can all enjoy the good things of the earth if we practice certain proved principles. Sound economics are essential with individuals as well as families if they are to enjoy prosperity. The Value of Work FORTUNATE are those children who learn early in life the satisfaction that comes from work well done. Young people should learn that they must work for what they get in life whether it be knowledge or material things. "By the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread" was one of the first commandments given to man. The Creator knew that work is essential for the welfare of the human race. Latter-day Saints have always been taught to labor and to be industrious. The Prophet Joseph Smith once remarked: "There is no place for an idler in the Church except that he repent and mend his ways" (See Doc. And Cov. 75:29). A great injustice is done to the youth who is deprived of the privilege of learning to work. Parents who impose no duties upon children make it difficult for them to compete later on with those who have learned, in their early years, to work. Habits of industry will stay with the individual throughout his entire life. It is often simpler to hire work done or to do it oneself than to have a child do the work. But, by following the easier way, a child's training is neglected. A wise mother insists that her daughter help prepare the evening meal, even though she knows it would be easier for her to do it than to train her daughter. While this training takes time and patience, nevertheless, it is the mother's responsibility. Art of Saving One of the most valuable habits children can acquire is the habit of saving. It is essential to a successful life. Saving seems to be a knack with some people, but it requires 'practice, as does any other habit. Saving means putting aside a portion of one's earnings systematically, no matter how small the amount. The amount saved is governed by the spending, as well as the earnings. The important thing is for a 786 References Through the Ages, pp. 192-206. _ Talmage, James E: Vitality of Mormon A Rational The LESSON DEPARTMENT family to decide that they will consistently save and put something away for a future day. The time to begin is now today, with whatever amount can be spared. In order to save regularly, there must be a plan that the whole family will agree to. Some part of the earnings must be set aside at pay periods. Extra money that is earned should be added to the savings account. If the small items are watched, such as money spent on shoe shines, movies, candy bars, magazines, and other incidentals, it will be surprising how fast the balance accumulates. In some families children are given money for birthday gifts. This money is added to ' their individual savings account each year. Over a period of years, this amount will grow to a considerable sum. Satisfaction will come to the entire family if they see 4 savings account growing as a result of united effort. Later in life this money can be used to very good advantage? for missions, college education, 4 new car, vacations, Of perhaps to meet unforeseen emergencies. Waste and Extravagance As a nation we are extravagant and wasteful. Waste is sinful and contrary to Latter-day Saint beliefs, both for the conduct of our individual lives and likewise of our government. It has been said that "Investigation will place at the head of causes of poverty, wastefulness inherited from wasteful parents." This '5 a serious indictment to parents who should always set an example of thrift and economy. The average American family, we ate told, wastes as much food each meal as is 787 consumed by family. The American garbage can is a national disgrace. An officer of one of our large cities recently made a survey to see how much food was being wasted. His survey of discarded food in cans in the better sections of town, as well as in the poorer sections, revealed in both instances that great quantities of food were being wasted slices of bread, scraps of meat, vegetables, and various other items being thrown away. Our wasteful habits must be corrected, particularly at this time, when millions of people in the world are going hungry. It is often the case that families with limited incomes use Poor judgment in buying. Especially ls this true of food buying. Prepared foods, pastries, and knickknacks are often in economical purchases. Welfare food agencies are constantly besieged for prepared cereals which are considerably more expensive, and often less nutritious, than cooked cereals. This is but one example. There are also millions of dollars worth of half-worn clothing hanging in the closets of American homes. This is a wanton extravagance when it is realized that minor alterations in style and renovating could give the clothing utility. A European peasant Wise Spending and Living Within One's Means The prosperity of a family de pends to a large extent on the way the income is spent. Unwise spending is the cause of much embarrassment and anxiety and causes family disunity. It is just as necessary to know how to spend as it is to know how to save. "We save carefully that we may spend wisely." Money wisely spent brings joy and happiness. "He who both saves and spends money is the happiest man because he has both enjoyments" (Boswell, James: Life of Dr. Johnson). Knowing how to use money, how to buy, what to buy, and when to buy is very important. One of the grave dangers facing many of our young people today is their inability to handle money. They do not know the value of a dollar because parents in too many cases have not trained them in the wise use Of money. Wages have been high and "easy come easy go," is a homely but true adage. Newly married couples can undermine a happy marital existence through unwise spending on the part of either. In these days of rapidly increasing costs, more attention must be given to budgeting; and young married people, particularly, should know how to budget their funds. It should be understood that the purpose of a budget is to enable one to tell money where to go instead of asking where it went. We are coming into an era of installment buying on a scale surpassing any hitherto known. Easy-payment plans and high-pressure salesmanship have been the cause of much financial unhappiness. Since this is an age of high-pressure methods, people trained in the art of selling appeal to the public through clever advertising over the air, in the newspapers and magazines. More than ever sales resistance is a prerequisite to the successful handling of family finances. Much trouble and financial difficulties come to families living beyond their income and to those who think only of the present. We are continually being admonished by our Church leaders to live within our income, and to avoid debt. In Gospel Standards, President Grant wrote: There is a peace and contentment that comes into the heart when we live within our means. Families should counsel together concerning finances, and children should know what the family can and cannot afford. Parents should not bicker over money matters, especially before children. They should set a policy, have an understanding, and stay with it. Parents often overindulge their children, even to the extent of going without necessities themselves and going into debt. Young people are intelligent and sensible and they will be willing to do what is right, if the matter is presented to them fairly. Children may be put on an allowance, allowing them to buy their own clothes. It is necessary, then, to see that they live within their allowance and pay for their entertainment and other items of expense as well. Wife's Part in Money Matters The wife should have an active interest in the finances of the family. Too often she is not interested, thinking that it is the husband's responsibility alone. Many wives and mothers have found them- ? selves widows with little or no knowledge of the simplest family finances which is cruel, costly and often disastrous. Financially inexperienced widows are often the victims of unscrupulous salesmen.  LESSON DEPARTMENT A banker once said: If husbands would counsel with their wives before making investments and buying stocks, many financial losses would be averted. Women's natural intuition seems to make her discerning and cautious. A middle aged woman who never married because she felt it her duty to stay at home and assist her family recently said: H father had listened to mother and hadn't bought that worthless stock, things would have been different for us. We never received a cent from the worthless investment and had to mortgage the home and let some of the land go. Serious consideration should be given before signing on the dotted ne. One wise woman used to say that she never made an important decision until she had "slept on it." Tithing and Fast Offerings Tithing is fundamental in any consideration of prosperity in the family. Every individual in the Church should feel it a privilege to be a tithe payer. No family can afford to deny themselves the blessings, both temporal and spiritual, that come from being honest tithe payers. Our children should be made to realize that they are indebted to their Heavenly Father for everything, and that he expects little in return only one tenth. Many people not of our faith pay one tenth of their income to their church or some organization where it will be used for the relief of the poor and needy. They feel this is one way they can discharge their social obligations to mankind. Latter-day Saint children should be proud to feel that they have con- 4 789 tributed to the kingdom of God on earth. They should be reminded that the tithing they pay, small as the amount may be, has helped to build chapels, temples, helped to support the religious educational program of the Church, the missionary system, and helped to maintain all other Church expenses. As we sit. In our comfortable meeting houses, Sunday after Sunday, where we come to worship, we should receive satisfaction in knowing that our contributions have helped to build, as well as maintain these houses. Imagine a father standing with his sons after the crops have been harvested, saying: "Well, boys, it is a joy to return one tenth to the Lord." Parents can direct their children to go to the bishop and pay their tithing on small amounts of money they have received. This will be of great value to the young boy or girl. Our children will need to keep account. Of what they have earned to know exactly how much they owe to the Lord. This will teach budgeting and encourage frugal habits of spending. Lessons in honesty will be learned. The boy who pays tithing is not likely to waste his time and money in games of chance and gambling. The Lord has made some startling promises to those who observe this law. Bring ye all the tithes unto the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open to you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it (Malachi 3:10). The fast offering is a wise and equitable way of taking care of the poor and needy. It is the financial basis of the great Welfare Plan. This free-will offering given to the bishop brings blessings to those who give as well as to those who receive. Through fasting, the physical body is brought into subjection to the spiritual body. Self-discipline is necessary in the lives of all for development. If parents will teach their children to fast, to give fast offerings, and to attend the fast meetings, they will be rewarded by having the faith of their children strengthened. The ability to save, which is the final proof of frugality and the foundation of prosperity in the family, is acquired through the payment of tithes and offerings. Observance of this command demands thoughtful management of family finances, and the by-products of such planning are the basis of prosperity. "The earth is full and there is enough and to spare."
