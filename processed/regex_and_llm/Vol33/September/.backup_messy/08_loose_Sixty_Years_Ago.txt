Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, September 1, and September 1 5, 1886 "For THE Rights OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women of ALL NATIONS" UTAH: Undoubtedly, today there is no other place, be it state, territory or country, under the broad canopy of heaven, which is so universally observed, as the subject of this sketch. Utah is talked about, written of and lectured upon, until, really, there remain but few, if any, new ideas concerning her, to be formed or expressed. So rigorously is this subject handled, both by friends and enemies, especially the latter, in all classes of society, that we scarcely find time to measure one point, or sound the force of one argument in relation to it, before something else is thrust upon us for consideration.� Hyacinth HANNAH T. KING: Our readers will very likely have noticed that for some time past there have been no contributions from the pen of our gifted sister, Hannah T. King, and possibly they have wondered why she has not written. For years she has been a regular contributor, scarcely a number of the paper having been issued without one or more of her articles appearing, but her health has failed, and she is no longer able to write, much as she would like to do so.�Editorial: RELIEF SOCIETY NOTES: Missionary and Indian donations are included in charitable disbursements. Wheat is computed by bushels. Presidents and secretaries are requested to attach full name and address to reports. LETTER OF APPRECIATION: Hints on household management, home government, the proper training of our human twigs, cookery, hygienic notes and pleasant Paragraphs are all very acceptable in a woman's companion. May the talent of Zion's daughters be fostered and improved by cultivation and demonstrated in the pages of The Woman's Exponent. May it indeed be a true representative of the faith, culture, intelligence and heroism of the noblest... And most self-sacrificing women in the world. �A Friend TEMPE, ARIZONA: Our ward and society are alive to the interest of the Latter-day work, and we are trying to live up to the requirements thereof.�J. D. Wilson HOUSEHOLD HINTS: To clean a bottle, put into it some kernels of corn, and a tablespoonful of ashes; fill it half full of water, and after a vigorous and thorough rinsing, the bottle will be found as good as new. NOTES ABOUT WOMEN: Jenny Lind's daughter, who is spoken of as possessing a marvelous voice, is coming to this country some time next winter. The biography of Queen Victoria, which Barnett Smith has had in hand for some time, will be published this month in one volume of 400 pages. It will contain several portraits. NOTES AND NEWS: Oliver Wendell Holmes, who has received no end of courtesy and good-will abroad, has come home safe and sound, having kept his seventy-seventh birthday on shipboard. Page 596
