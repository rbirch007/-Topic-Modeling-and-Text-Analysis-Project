United States Savings Bonds y= the war period many people have manifested their patriotism and wisdom by purchasing Government Bonds. In many cases the Bonds are still being held and are earning interest for the holder. This investment has been a blessing to many people and what they have saved will be useful to them in the future. Some individuals, however, are disposing of their holdings and spending their money for unnecessary things, and if hard times come, they may find themselves unable to meet their obligations.... If those who have purchased Government Bonds will hold them and gain the benefit that results from possessing them, they will be wiser than if they dispose of their holdings and squander their substance. Surely we have nothing more secure in the way of an investment than Government Bonds. Excerpts from a statement made by President George Albert Smith for the United States Savings Bonds Division Utah FULFILLMENT Verda P. Bollschweiler If you count wealth in worldly goods, I'm poor, I must confess, But a hearth with loved ones gathered round Is a treasure I possess. My time is spent in humble tasks For those I love and who love me, And children's laughter in my home Is like a symphony. To teach some little ones to walk The path that Jesus trod, Can thrill my soul with ecstasy? A paean to my God. To try to ease a neighbor's pain, And wipe her children's tears away; To do my bit in time of need; These are the things that fill my day. To keep a home where those I love Can turn with joy when day is spent. Oh, I am rich beyond compare? A woman who is well content.
