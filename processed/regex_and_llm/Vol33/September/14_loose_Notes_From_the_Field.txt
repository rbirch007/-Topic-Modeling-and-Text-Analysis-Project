Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, December 3, 1946 Objective: growth and joy of women in service. THE administration of the restored Church of Christ as it now is organized upon the earth comes under the order of the Priesthood. 'This means that God himself is at the helm, that the various offices of his order were created by his will and at his express command, and, that in those who lead in his work there must be an understanding of the meaning of true humility, or the Lord cannot fully bestow his blessings. In other words, "not my will, but thine, be done," must be the devout wish of those who would serve him. It may be a long and weary road men travel before they truly come to the full realization of this perfect order of living, and by the time that many have done so, they are ready to pass on into another life, leaving the world once again to a new generation which must for itself learn, through trial and error, the Lord's way to better living. To help his wayward children, in part at least, to understand the blessings of To trace the steps which developed an organization to provide for the brotherly kindness which lead to the kingdom, God instituted the establishment among men of our constitutional government (Doc. And Cov. 101:77-80). The Constitution and Bill of Rights guarantee justice for all. But men, not mindful of the will of God in their lives, often forget the good, and, if called into public office, seek only to promote personal advancement or the interests of special groups. A constitution with bylaws, while one of the best instruments devised by which the common man may be assured his rights, is yet short of the perfect order for the more abundant life. For the perfect brotherhood of man, there needs to be a complete understanding of the fatherhood of God. When men learn that the Lord's way is the best way, then they will accept those he calls to preside over his people and regard their words of counsel as his own. Such an order literally brings upon the earth the kingdom since those Page 631 632 leading have a direct channel to the source of all wisdom, and power and vision to lead the Church aright. In the rich, but trying days, of "Nauvoo the Beautiful," the long: felt desire of the women of the Church to organize their efforts in service found fulfillment. The ex: acting work of manual labor on the part of the men of the Church could not have been borne for so long a period had not the women been ever at hand to provide the physical and spiritual comforts. During the building of the Kirtland Temple, it will be remembered, the sisters were ever on hand. The wife of Hiram Kimball, Sarah M. Kimball, tells of how the sisters of the Church would cheerfully chum butter and bring it to the workmen even to the point of denying their own tables. The spirit of co-operative industry was ever a part of the restored Church. Men and women put the cause of Zion above self. This, naturally, created a desire among them to organize. It is a most significant fact that, as a result of such a desire, the Relief Society came into being, not so much from the standpoint of its being organized, but rather by the way in which the Prophet of the Lord turned that desire into the more perfect pattern of organization under the Priesthood. Note how it was done as related in an account by Sarah M. Kimball: In the spring of 1842, a maiden lady (Miss Cook) was seamstress for me, and the subject of combining our efforts for assisting the temple hands came up in conversation. She desired to be helpful, but had no means to furnish. I told her I would furnish material if she would make some shirts for the workmen. It was then suggested that some of the neighbors might wish to combine means and efforts with ours, and we decided to invite a few to come and consult with us on the subject of forming a Ladies' Society. The neighboring sisters met in my parlor and decided to organize. I was delegated to call on Sister Eliza R. Snow and ask her to write for us a constitution and bylaws and submit them to President Joseph Smith prior to our next Thursday's meeting. She cheerfully responded, and when she read them to him he replied that the constitution and bylaws were the best he had ever seen. "But," he said, "this is not what you want. Tell the sisters their offering is accepted of the Lord, and He has something better for them than a written constitution. Invite them all to meet me and a few of the brethren in the Masonic Hall over my store next Thursday afternoon, and I will organize the sisters under the Priesthood after a pattern of the Priesthood." He further said, "This Church was never perfectly organized until the women were thus organized" (VI, March 1919, page 129). The Lord had something better for them than a written constitution. How significant and most fittingly true have become the Prophet's words. A society founded upon 4 constitutional order would have, by nature, its roots in the customs of men. Officers to lead such a society would tend to look more to the legally granted rights of their calling than to the calling itself. But the Lord, through his Prophet, chose to outline a better way of turning to account the desires of his handmaidens. 'They, in part at least, were to function under the. Administrative order of the Priesthood even though they could not be given the Priesthood itself. Accordingly, 'on Thursday afternoon, March 17, 1842, as the day agreed upon, eighteen attentive LESSON DEPARTMENT women met the Prophet Joseph Smith in company with Elders John Taylor and Willard Richards. The Prophet called Elder Taylor to the chair and appointed Elder Willard Richards to act as secretary. "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning" was sung, and Elder Taylor opened the meeting with prayer. The Prophet then began to organize the women present, who were: Emma H. Smith Sarah M. Cleveland Phebe Ann Hawkes Elizabeth Jones Sophia Packard Philinda Merrick Martha Knight Desdemona Fulmer Elizabeth Ann Whitney Bathsheba W. Smith Phebe M. Wheeler Elvira A. Coles Margaret A. Cook Sarah M. Kimball Eliza R. Snow Sophia Robinson Leonora Taylor Sophia R. Marks In addition to the eighteen women present, the following women, not present, were also admitted to membership at this first meeting: Sarah Higbee Thirza Cahoon Keziah A. Morrison Marinda N. Hyde Abigail Allred Mary Snider Lydia D. Granger Cynthia A. Eldredge President Joseph Smith addressed the sisters: " _ _ to illustrate the object of the Society that the Society of the sisters might provoke the brethren to good works in looking to the wants of the poor, searching after objects of charity and in administering to their wants to assist by correcting the morals and strengthening the virtues of the community, and save the elders the trouble of rebuking; that they may give their time to other duties, 633 etc., in their public teaching" (Relief Society Minutes, March 17, 1842). President Smith further remarked: ?that an organization to show them how to work was sufficient, or how to go to work was sufficient. He proposed that the sisters elect a presiding officer to preside over them, and let the presiding officer choose two counselors to assist in the duties of her office... And if they need his instruction, ask him, he will give it from time to time.... Let this presidency serve as a Constitution all their decisions be considered law, and acted upon as such. If any officers are wanted to carry out the design of the institution let them be appointed and set apart... - The minutes of your meetings ill be precedent for you to act upon your Constitution and law" (A Century of Relief Society, page 15)- "Let this presidency serve as a Constitution all their decisions be considered law, and acted upon as such." To one not knowing the workings of the Priesthood, such a plan of organization might seem dictatorial. In outward form perhaps, yes, but in inward spirit, far from such. To one who understands the gospel call to authority, comes the knowledge that such falls under the words of the Master, "Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you." In other words, the call to true leadership can come only to one who is worthy in every way to completely forget self in service to fellow man. "He that is greatest among you shall be your servant" (Matt. 23:11). If this principle is thoroughly understood by all Church members, then officer and layman, alike, willingly unite for the sake of the cause, since the cause is greater by far than anyone in it, great or small. By instructing the sisters to counsel together under their presidency, and by directing that presidency to look to the head of the Church for final counsel, the Prophet established for the Relief Society the pattern of government that could lay claim on direct inspiration from the Lord himself. Think how such an organization so conceived and so dedicated can serve! To all its members, there can come the assurance that all services given will go directly to the relief of want and suffering. To the officers of such a society, there can come the peace of mind known only to those who have taken upon them his yoke and learned that his burden is light. Why? Because they have the joy of service that comes because the call came rather than was sought. Today, after more than a century, the golden symbol of the Relief Society circles the hearts of more than a hundred thousand souls. 'The good bread of life and the touch of learning are therein shown, and the phrase "Charity never faileth," forever becomes the watchword of service. Women who belong have found its eternal meaning. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion: With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1. On March 20, 1839, just about three years to the day before the organization of the Relief Society, the Prophet Joseph Smith was a prisoner in the Liberty Jail. He gave us at that time one of the most beautiful prophecies on the Priesthood of God and its functioning that has ever been written. In part, he said, "That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven" (Doc. And Cov. 121:36). Just what does this mean? Give each member of your class a few minutes time to write down her answer. Then have each respond. After the response, have all of the 1215s section of the Doctrine and Covenants read without interruption. At the conclusion of the reading, make especially the verses 33 to 46 the subject of class discussion. 2. If you were asked to name just one joy of service the Relief Society has offered you, what would it be? Get a response from all class members before reading to them the following words, addressed by the Prophet Joseph at the sixth meeting of the Society held at Nauvoo, April 28, 1842: Let this Society teach women how to behave towards their husbands, to treat them with mildness and affection. When a man is borne down with trouble, when he is perplexed with care and difficulty, if he can meet a smile instead of an argument or a murmur if he can meet with mildness, it will calm down his soul and soothe his feelings; when the mind is going to despair, it needs a solace of affection and kindness. You will receive instructions through the order of the Priesthood which God has established, through the medium of those appointed to lead, guide and direct the affairs of the Church in this last dispensation; and I now turn the key in your behalf in the name of the Lord, and this Society shall rejoice, and knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time henceforth; this is the beginning of better days to the poor and needy, who shall be made to rejoice and pour forth blessings on your heads (Documentary History of the Church, IV, pp. 606-7). For this lesson, the most significant material for inspiration and reading is A Centenary of Relief Society, published by the General Board of the Relief Society, price so cents. The teacher should bring to the class at least one copy of this excellent presentation of one hundred years of Relief Society.  Objective: To show that the pioneers recognized and Practiced the first Principle of revealed religion, namely faith faith in God, faith in their leaders, faith in one another, and faith in a great Cause, Visiting Teachers' Messages�Our Pioneer Heritage
Lesson 3�Faith
President Amy Brown Lyman
For Tuesday, December 3, 1946
Objective: To show that the pioneers recognized and practiced the first principle of revealed religion, namely faith�faith in God, faith in their leaders, faith in one another, and faith in a great cause.
THAT the pioneers had great and abiding faith in their Heavenly Father, in their leaders, in one another, and in the great gospel cause we constantly demonstrated in their daily lives and in their many co-operative undertakings.
One of the severest tests of their faith came in the winter of 1846 when they were forced to choose between relinquishing their religious beliefs or giving up their homes. And they were not only losing their homes, but also their beautiful city, Nauvoo, and their beloved temple which had been built at such great cost in effort and sacrifice.
As dear to their hearts as were their lovely homes, their sacred temple, and their beloved city, dearer still to them was the gospel of the Master. And with the same indomitable faith and courage as that which had been demonstrated by the saints in Missouri, they chose to cling to their religious convictions and meet whatever hazards and sacrifices this action might involve. They realized fully that leaving their homes at this time did not mean merely trying again to locate in another part of the State or in another of the adjoining states, but that it meant a move, a desperate and daring move, into the great, un-
known, western desert, where, far from their enemies, they hoped to establish a home in which they could worship God in perfect freedom and work out in their own way their social and religious problems.
The migration of the Mormon pioneers�their exodus from Nauvoo, their journey across the plains, and their settlement in the desert, is one of the greatest examples of pioneering in human history. The question always arises, how was it ever accomplished? The answer is that it was accomplished through unflinching faith, accompanied by unceasing struggle and matchless hard work.
First, there was implicit faith and trust in the Lord and in his protecting care. Second, there was faith in their leaders and in the inspiration of those leaders. And finally, there was their faith in the great cause to which they were devoted. It was their conviction that theirs was the true gospel of the Master, which had been restored again, and that they had been called to help to prepare the earth for the coming of Christ. Thus it is seen that religion with its dynamic qualities was the most vital thing in the life of these pioneers, sustaining and steadying them in every adjustment they were called to make. LESSON DEPARTMENT 635  Work Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 3?Fitting and Adjusting Patterns, and Cutting Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman For Tuesday, December 10, 1946 Objective: To decide the proper style of pattern and suitable material for a given individual; to teach how to interpret commercial patterns; to demonstrate the adjusting of a pattern to individual measurements, and the cutting. Reference: Patterns and Measurements SATISFACTORY work is based on accurate measurement. To measure is to verify a given length or space in terms of a_ standard gauge. For all types of dressmaking, a good pattern is indispensable. It is not economy to use makeshift patterns at any time. Widths and lengths of the figure are the basic measurements used in patterns. All patterns should be purchased according to bust measurements, with the exception of skirts, slacks, etc., which are usually purchased by hip or waist measurements. It is better to use a tape measure to compare the size of your pattern with your own measurements, rather than to attempt to pin the thin tissue pieces together and try them on; however, in order to thoroughly understand a given pattern, it may be helpful to pin the various parts together before laying them out. A pattern carefully fitted to your measurements, lines, and proportions, should cut a garment which will need little or no The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapters 10 and 11. Fitting. 'The home sewer can eliminate fitting problems by carefully following, step by step, the instructions given on each pattern for making the proper adjustments. Patterns are made to standard measurements, yet seldom is the human figure standard in every detail. Laying on the Pattern To ensure the proper fit of a garment, lay the pattern over the material on a table, being sure that the pieces are laid either straight of the goods or bias, as the pattern indicates. Cutting Be sure that the pattern and the material are pinned securely together, and are lying flat on the table before beginning to cut the garment. Also, recheck carefully with a tape measure, the bust, waist, hip, and length measurements before doing your cutting. Assignment for January: Bring your pattern and cut-out material to class. Also, bring pieces of different types of cloth, such as cotton, wool, silk, rayon, chiffon, etc.; also, a needle, thread, and thimble. LESSON DEPARTMENT 637 Literature America as Revealed in Its Literature lesson 3 America's First War for Freedom Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, December 17, 1946 Within its shade of elm and oak The church of Berkley Manor stood; There Sunday found the rural folk, And some esteem'd of gentle blood.The pastor rose; the prayer was strong; The psalm was warrior Divid's song. The text, a few short words of might,� "The Lord of Hosts shall arm the right!" He spoke of wrongs too long endured, Of sacred rights to be secured . . . And rising on his theme's broad wing, In face of death he dared to fling Defiance to a tyrant king. A moment there was awful pause� When Berkley cried, "Cease, traitor! cease!" God's temple is the house of peace!" The other shouted, "Nay, not so, When God is with our righteous cause; His holiest places then are ours. . . . In this, the dawn of Freedom's day, There is a time to fight and pray." "The Rising," Thomas B. Read
ABOUT a century and a half had passed since the Virginians had landed on the shore of America. From that band of adventurers, the Pilgrims, and other small groups of freedom seekers clinging through bitter hardships to a new world, the population had increased to more than three million souls. Expanding farms, fur trade, beginnings of manufacturing and of shipping, were adding wealth, comforts, and luxuries. Beyond this, there was also something even more significant: Americans were becoming solidly
grounded in the art of governing themselves.
True, they had gone forward�for the most part willingly�under king-appointed governors. Yet they had a large share, through their own chosen assemblies, in making their own laws and directing their own welfare as colonists. Jealous of their rights as English freemen, they brooked little tyranny from the officers of the Crown.
Under beneficent administration of such prime ministers as William Pitt, their basic liberties were respected. When others of less democratic spirit rose to power, however, trouble began. Such was the situation during the reign of George the Third. Unlike his father and his grandfather, who had played only minor roles as English monarchs, this Third George, under stimulus it is said of his ambitious mother, decided that he would be king in more than name.
Backed by supporters, then of a majority in Parliament, and with king-minded prime ministers, for a time he had his autocratic way. A debt, incurred largely by the French and Indian War, had to be met. Since this had been fought on American soil, it was felt that the colonists should pay their share. To this there was not so much objection; but the way the taxes were levied, with the Americans having no voice in the matter, was in violation of the ancient right expressed in the phrase, "No taxation without representation." When agents of the king tried to enforce the "Stamp Act" as passed by Parliament, on the colonists, they met bitter opposition. Other laws to suppress the patriotic resistance only added fuel to the flames. Finally, alarmed by the conflagration they had touched off in America, the British lawmakers called Ben Franklin, then in London as representative of Pennsylvania, to get some firsthand information as to the situation Overseas. In response to their questions as to what were the causes of the uprising, the American statesman told them frankly of the abuses they were heaping on their fellow freemen in America. He said, further, that by these acts Parliament, formerly looked upon with respect and gratitude for the protection it had given the colonies in their rights, was losing its high place in their hearts. "Don't you think," asked one, "they would submit to the Stamp Act, if it was modified, the obnoxious parts taken out, and the duty reduced to some particulars of small moment?" "No," replied Franklin, "they will never submit to it." "If the Stamp Act were repealed, would it induce the Assemblies of America to acknowledge the right of Parliament to tax them?" "No, never." "Is there a power on earth that can force them to erase their resolutions?" "No power," returned Franklin, "how great so ever, can force men to change their opinions." Largely as the result of Franklin's plain talk, Parliament repealed the Stamp Act except for a small tax on tea. This was kept, it seems, that King George might assert his right - to tax the colonies. An answer to this came dramatically from a group of Americans, when, disguised as Indians, they boarded a vessel in Boston Harbor and pitched its cargo of tea overboard. This so-called "Boston Tea Party" made the king and his cohorts furious. By royal decree the harbor was Closed, and an army sent there to be quartered, in part, in the homes of the people, and to enforce the will of the monarch. Naturally, this set not only Massachusetts but all the other colonies aflame. Literature, expressive of the spirit of the times, came mainly in the form of fiery speeches of protest against tyranny. One of these, by Patrick Henry in the House of Burgesses or Legislature of Virginia, sounded a ringing keynote for the patriot forces. He had introduced a resolution there calling for Virginia to join with the other colonies in the fight for freedom. Other members of the House, whose interests were tied closely with England, voiced their opposition. When they had said their say, young Patrick, brought up on the frontier, rose calmly and said: Mr. President, it is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes to a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren until she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men engaged in the great and arduous struggle for liberty? I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British Ministry for the last ten years to justify  LESSON DEPARTMENT the hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House? Is it the insidious smile with which our petition has lately been received Trust it not sir.... Suffer yourselves not to be betrayed with a kiss, Rising in intensity, as he recited wrongs and met the arguments against his resolution, he finally brought his classic address to its close with these burning words: What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear or peace SO sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! Patrick Henry's resolution was passed, and Virginia joined with full force in the war for freedom. One of her great sons, George Washington, was made commander. In chief of the American armies, Another, Thomas Jefferson, was to write the Declaration of Independence, an immortal document of classic quality. Patrick Henry, chosen governor of the Old Dominion, was to throw all his youthful vigor into the cause. To the north, in New England, War was on. Patriots, led by Hancock and Adams, were openly and secretly resisting the armies of England. A group called the "Sons of Liberty" kept close watch on the enemy's movements. One of these, Paul Revere, getting word of an at. Tack planned by the "redcoats" to destroy stores the Americans had gathered, made a midnight ride from Boston to Lexington to sound the warning, while William Dawes took another route to rouse the country folk. In Longfellow's "Paul Revere's 639 Ride," one of his Wayside Inn poems and a classic in storytelling, we are given the picture and spirit of those times. Just a few lines from the old favorite will serve to bring them back vibrantly: He said to his friend, "If the British march By land or sea from the town to-night, Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch Of the North Church tower as a signal light? One, if by land, and two, if by sea; And I on the opposite shore will be, Ready to ride and spread the alarm Through every Middlesex village and farm, For the country folk to be up and to arm." Then he said, "Good night!" and with muffled oar Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore... Two lanterns flash the signal from the high tower; then? A hurry of hoofs in a village street, A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet: That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light, The fate of a nation was riding that night; And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight, Kindled the land into flame with its heat. Benjamin Franklin, meantime, barely escaping capture by the British, had returned to his homeland. With him came Thomas Paine. An. Other lover of liberty, to lend a hand in helping the Americans win the struggle. Through his stirring pamphlets, Paine lifted the cause into the clear, not only for the struggling patriots but for the world. Wo essays, "Common Sense" and "The Crisis," are among the best of these writings. In this para- graph from "The Crisis," by this friend of the early Americans, we catch something of the spirit and the thinking of Thomas Paine: These are times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the summer patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service to their country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. 'Tyranny... Is not easily conquered; yet we have this glorious consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness, only, that gives everything its value, Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated. There were staunch friends of the struggling colonies even among English leaders. Some of those in Parliament gave warm support to the cause for which Americans were then fighting. One of them, the brilliant Edmund Burke, indeed, made what is esteemed by literary critics as among the finest of orations. This on the theme, Conciliation with America. Following are illustrative lines which show its high quality as well as expressing its sincere friendship for those fighting for freedom: The proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of wat; not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations.... It is simple peace sought in its natural course and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace sought in the spirit of peace. The use of force alone is but temporary. It may subdue for a moment, but it does not remove the necessity of subduing again; and a nation is not governed which is perpetually to be conquered. Burke's resolution was not passed by Parliament. He was of the minority party at that time. England, however, after about half a century, finally arrived on something of his high plane of thinking, and put his ideas into practice in governing its colonies. This, however, was after she had lost the richest of them all] ?our country. The time came, in the struggle, when American statesmen saw that the freedom sought could be won only through complete separation from the mother country. Our Continental Congress, after earnest consideration, finally unitedly took this step by adopting the Declaration of Independence drafted by Thomas Jefferson, with the help of the other members of the committee? ?Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston. Its opening lines strike the keynote with the assertion of "man's inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," to secure which "governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." A recital of the wrongs suffered through tyranny of a misguided king, is followed with the declaration severing all connection with the mother country; and then comes the solemn words: "For support of this declaration we mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor." After the signing of this document by all the fifty-three representatives of the Thirteen Colonies, John Hancock, president of the body, is reported to have said, "Now, gentlemen, we must all hang together." To which Benjamin Franklin returned, "Yes, or we shall all hang separately." It was a serious, courageous,  LESSON DEPARTMENT far-seeing action these stalwart Americans had performed that day. As a boy, the writer was brought close to the spirit of that first Independence Day by an unknown poet, who bequeathed to us the poem "Independence Bell." 'Though too young to get the full import of its meaning, the lad took delight in reciting its ringing lines. Among them, these: Will they do it? Dare they do it? Who is speaking? What's the news? What of Adams? What of Sherman? Oh, God grant they. Won't refuse! The story of the boy who stood waiting to give the signal that the Declaration had been signed, was especially stirring for another young American who liked to make these lines resound: Hush'd the people's swelling murmur As they listen breathlessly? "Ring!" he shouts; "Ring, grandpapa! Ring! Oh, ring for liberty!" Final lines from the patriotic poem echoed with waxing import with the years: The old State House bell is silent, Hushed is now its clamorous tongue, But the spirit it awakened Still is living, ever young. And we'll ne'er forget the bellman Who, that great day in July, Hailed the birth of Independence, Which, please God, shall never die. One thing that ever seems born of true inspiration is this: On the Liberty Bell is this line from Leviticus (25:10): "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." What more fitting line could be chosen for that bell? Magnetized by the Declaration of Independence, true Americans 641 everywhere gave themselves to the testing task of maintaining their bold stand for freedom. The British, stung by the challenge, girded for the fight. A war, dragging through years, came with its discouragements, hopes, and tears. Yet steadfastness and sacrifice on the part of the determined patriots finally brought victory and peace for them. Their enemy, vanquished at last in 1783, signed the treaty that acknowledged the independence of America. A new nation, with boundaries extending from Canada to Florida and westward to the "Father of Waters" was born. Right of self-government had been established. More than this, out of the struggle had come a rich heritage of heroism. Out of the rich materials of this first war for freedom distinctive American literature, naturally, has been woven. Limitations of this study permit only a glance at some of the stirring poems and orations, and brief mention of some of the intriguing novels portraying characters, events, legends, and scenes of those days. Not many poems produced during the Revolution have survived. One that keeps its popularity this because of its sprightly rhythm and humor is "Yankee Doodle." It was created in derision of the ill clad American fighters by some "redcoat," and seized upon by the colonial boys as a battle song. In later years, our poets gave us poems that are vibrant with the spirit of the fight for freedom. Notable among these, are: "Paul Revere's Ride," already mentioned; "Song of Marion's Men," by Bryant; "Nathan Hale," by Francis Miles Finch; "Warren's Address," by John Pierpont; 642 "Molly Maguire at Monmouth," by William Collins; "The Old Continentals," by McMaster; ""Grandmother's Story of The Battle of Bunker Hill," by Holmes; and "Concord Hymn," by Emerson, from which the following stanzas are taken. It was sung when the battle monument at Concord was dedicated. By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April's breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood, And fired the shot heard round the - world.  Spirit that made those heroes dare To die, and leave their children free, Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee. Novels, portraying historical events and characters, are usually created some years after the dramatic occurrences have been enacted. This is to get the perspective and the romance, which can hardly be seen when too close to persons and happenings. To use an analogy: when one stands close to a mountain, one is likely to see its roughness, and little peaks may loom large. Set it off in the distance, shroud it in purple haze with a halo of sunset, and it becomes more mystic, more romantic. Its peaks, too, take on their proper proportions. Our war for freedom, in keeping with this illustration, was not portrayed in fiction until half a century or more had passed. Then we began to get such stories as James Fennimore Cooper's Spy based on the tale of a patriot who, at the risk of life and honor, served Washington. Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker, by S. Weir Mitchell, is another novel portraying the times around old Philadelphia. Janice Meredith, by Paul L. Ford, gives us an intriguing story of a patriotic girl of New Jersey at the time Washington was outmatching the British in that colony. The Seats of the Mighty, by Gilbert Parker, takes us into Canada during those stirring days. In The Great Meadow, by Elizabeth Roberts, we have pictured beginnings that led to the Revolution, and something of the training of Washington for his leadership. Rabble in Arms, by Kenneth Roberts, pictures the days that the Continental Army was finding itself. Drums Along the Mohawk, by Walter D. Edmonds, is another realistic picture of the struggle set among the settlers and Indians of Upper New York, with the Dutch General Herkimer as one of the leading characters. Richard Carvel, by Winston Churchill, gives us a portrayal of the war in the farther south. In Alice of Old Vincennes, by Thompson, we are taken into the Northwest Territory with the stalwart George Rogers Clark. Horseshoe Robinson, by John Pendleton Kennedy, is another novel much in spirit like Cooper's tales, but portraying characters and scenes during the fighting in the Carolinas. These are but a few ?those that have won favor with readers of the stories created out of the rich materials of America's first war for freedom. Obviously, in this necessarily brief lesson, only a few guidelines could be offered to those who would read the worthy literature portraying the days when America was fighting for liberty. What has been given, however, to interpret the inner spirit and true meaning of that struggle, should LESSON DEPARTMENT be of vital value in helping members of the class to find literature? songs, poems, orations, essays, dramas, and novels that are truly American in spirit. This study should also give real aid in the interpretation and evaluation of such literature. Discussion and Activities 1. "Sacred rights" is an expression in the opening poem. What would you give as one of these rights? Z. Why were the Americans so insistent that there be no taxation without representation? How is that principle protected for us today? 3. Under the direction of your class leader, take your part in preparing for a fifteen to twenty minute voicing of a few choice poems such as those named in the lesson which express, with artistry, the spirit, thought, or some stirring event of America's first war for freedom. 4. Join with class members in reporting briefly on some outstanding novel such as those named giving its plot, its major scenes, its main characters.

Optional Lessons in Lieu of Literature THE GOSPEL AS A WAY OF LIFE Lesson 3 Faith Elder T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, December 17, 1946 OUR children, ranging in age from four to nine years, were downhearted. It seemed to them that all the joy in life had suddenly ended. Their mother, a normally healthy woman, lay in bed, suffering physical pain and the discomfort of a high temperature. Father was at work, and the children, frightened by the illness that had come upon their mother, were in despair. Then the nine-year-old hustled the three younger ones into the back bedroom and said, "Let's ask Heavenly Father to make Mom better." Kneeling down, the oldest one prayed fervently to God for the 644 restoration of their mother. When she had finished her petition to the Almighty, she said to the others, "Mama will soon be well again." Returning to the mother's bedroom, they found their mother greatly improved. "Mama," said their spokesman, "Father in heaven is going to make you better. We prayed, and I know you'll soon be well." Within an hour she was about her household cares again, all signs of fever and pain having disappeared. This story is one of simple faith that has been duplicated many times in the lives of faithful Christians. Of course, the exercise of faith has not always met with such instant spiritual manifestations, for reasons which are beyond our understanding, but faith is the first principle of the gospel and it is imperative that we develop our faith to the utmost. In the eleventh chapter of Hebrews is found one of the greatest expositions of faith that is contained in the Bible. It defines faith as "... The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Then the writer makes the declaration that through faith the worlds were framed by the word of God (Heb. 11:1, 3). From these declarations it becomes evident that faith is a principle of great power and constructive action. The following explanation of the nature of faith is very descriptive: Faith is a conviction, an attitude of mind, which is not certain knowledge and yet is an assurance far stronger than mere belief, hope or desire. We have a knowledge of things we have already experienced. Our knowledge relates largely to the past, including, of course, the immediate past. Faith, on the other hand, is pointed toward the future, toward the possible, toward the unexperienced or larger experience. A man of faith is hopeful, optimistic, courageous, adventurous, confident and forward-looking. Faith is like a searchlight casting its beam far ahead of its present position (Lowell L. Bennion, The Religion Of the Latter-day Saints, p. 115). When the Prophet Joseph Smith was listing the beliefs of the Latter-day Saints, he wrote, "We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are, First, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ...." This was not a mere chance statement. It was a declaration of the prime importance of faith in the life of an individual. It was placed first because upon one's faith depends one's progression. Without faith, one neither seeks to find God, nor attempts to make his life conform to the will of God. It thus becomes the starting point from which one progresses from a condition of ignorance of God and his commandments, to one in which the saving power of God is recognized. So important is the element of faith during mortality, that it is listed as one of the primary purposes for restoring the gospel to the earth. Perhaps the most detailed discussion of the nature of faith and how it can be developed and used is found in the Book of Mormon, Alma 32:16-43. Alma states that "... Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true" (Alma 320). He then tells how one may develop faith, and his teachings are valuable because they are descriptive of the method that we need to use LESSON DEPARTMENT more and more in our present-day lives. But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my word (Alma 32:27). He further likened this experimental method of developing faith to the planting of a seed, which germinates and grows to a mature plant. In similar fashion, Alma admonished his hearers to nourish religious belief until it would grow into profound faith. But if you will nourish the word... By your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up into everlasting life (Alma 32:41). When the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants was revealed, the Lord declared that because of his knowledge of the calamities that should come upon the earth, he had called Joseph Smith to instruct the inhabitants of the earth how to escape from the coming afflictions. He listed the purposes of the restoration, and one of them is stated as follows: "That faith also might increase in the earth" (Doc. And Cov. 1:21). From this statement it is apparent that the promotion of an increase in faith was an essential goal of the restored gospel. The coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the first vision, the visitations of Moroni, the restoration of the Aaronic and the Melchizedek Priesthoods, and the many revelations on doc- 645 trine and Church government were all calculated to increase faith in the hearts of men, if they would investigate the authenticity of these events and use Alma's method of developing faith. Of primary importance in the life of anyone who wishes to gain eternal exaltation is an unwavering faith in God the Father. We must study his teachings contained in the scriptures and learn his will concerning us. We must recognize him as the Creator of the universe, and as the Father of our spirits. A second requirement concerning faith on the part of the individual is that one must have an abiding and unwavering faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. To many people this requirement appears to call for nothing more than a passive acknowledgment and a confession of belief in his saving grace. The scriptures teach us, however, that this faith must become a dynamic, intelligent thing. We must study, investigate, pray, and gain a testimony of the reality of our Father in heaven. The next -step is to change our lives in such a way that we live in harmony with the spirit of Christ, and thus strive to make our lives Christ-like. True faith must be built upon a foundation of truth, and must be acquired through diligent study. The apostle Paul stated this doctrine | clearly in his letter to the Roman saints. He discussed the tenacious devotion with which the Jews observed the letter of their religious laws, and regretted the fact that their belief would not save them until they changed their ignorance of the truth for correct principles. Then he said: Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God (Romans 10:1-3). Paul's teaching indicates that much more than devotion is required faith must be based upon truth. Another requirement is that we have faith in the atonement of Jesus, and his redeeming power, and in the plan of salvation. Through this faith, we are enabled to overcome sin and forsake it. This faith will move us to action, whereby our faith will be manifest in our improved life and conduct. The gospel teaches mankind that no one should live exclusively within himself. Salvation is a collective ideal, designed to save all of God's children. Faith thus includes a belief in others. It asks us to love not only our neighbors, but our enemies as well. It requires us to forgive those who trespass against us. It demands that we work unceasingly to lead those who do not believe, to have faith in the gospel plan of salvation. It asks us to serve those in need, and divide our substance with the destitute. Nothing but an abiding faith in the Godhead and the gospel can lead men to have this great faith in others. Last, but by no means, least, we must have faith in ourselves. We must have faith that we are of divine origin, that our bodies are mortal tabernacles created by God, in which are housed his spirit children. When a person has attained this conviction, impure thoughts and vicious habits that corrupt the soul will be shunned. The Holy Spirit may then be the constant companion of that individual, to inspire and direct in pure thoughts, clean living, unselfish devotion to the cause of the Church and unlimited service to others. Questions and Activity Problems 1. Assign someone to search out important verses of Alma's discussion on the nature of faith and have them read in class. 2. List the five applications of faith that are discussed in the lesson. 3. Under what circumstances did Christ not perform mighty works? (See Matt. 13:53-58. Contrast with Matt. 17:14-21). 4.
