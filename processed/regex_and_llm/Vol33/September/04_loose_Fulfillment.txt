fulfillment. "Ye shall know the truth and the truth will make you free" (John 8:32). As soon as we have a generation that does not believe in freedom and does net have the moral strength required of freemen, freedom will be lost. Nazi Germany offers a splendid example of what happens when the wrong sort of ideals are instilled into people. How different world events might have been, had their attitudes and ideals been focused on Christianity, implemented by an understanding of what constitutes democratic living. But, has the Church been unconcerned about teaching religious values and in promoting the good life? Indeed it has not. A great and effective work has been done by teachers A MESSAGE TO TEACHERS in the Church. Why, then, is there any real issue about improvement of teaching? The answer is quite clear. In a world which has suddenly learned how to blow itself to bits, goodness must be more directly sought through more effective teaching. Those who say that goodness cannot be taught are talking dangerous nonsense. They interpret teaching as a narrow, lesson memorizing process. In this sense, of course, goodness cannot be taught. But mere memorizing is not teaching. Teaching not only can, but must find its most important duty in changing the minds of people from an egotistic, selfish, materialistic philosophy to an altruistic and idealistic philosophy, that is, it must change the nature of the desire or motive life of people. We must permeate all our teaching with the concept of value. Religious and ethical standards must be brought to bear as bases of judgment upon every possible occasion. Is it right? Is it true? Is it honorable? Is it fair? Is it just? Is it in harmony with the will of God? These questions should become almost automatic. Wisely directed instruction should leave upon the desire-life of the individual the tendency always to gain greater satisfaction from those values termed spiritual; the values which grow with their exercise and sharing. That means that we must do many things more effectively than we have in the past. That is not easy. Why is it not easy? Because we adults are victims of patterns fixed upon us by our own limited experiences, we are inflexible when we should be on 581 a creative search for right solutions to problems. To paraphrase Lincoln, we must disenthrall ourselves from rigid patterns and think and act anew. Our case is new�our day is piled high with new difficulty. Our greatest sin is lethargy�the refusal to become what we might become�to allow the good of today to crystallize�to become a hard mold, carried into tomorrow after it has lost its pertinency. We are complacent in the presence of evil that does not directly affect us. We stop thinking, and our opinions as a result become fixed. We deny the very meaning of life, which is growth by cultivation. RELIGIOUS values cannot be developed independently of national thought, the instrument of intelligence. An elderly gentleman, in attempting to account for the sad deterioration that had taken place in his little home town said: "Dem dat's good ain't able. Dem dat's able ain't good." Goodness, without ability, is a vehicle headed in the right direction, but it has no motive power, and it lacks a skilled driver. Ability, without goodness, is a ruthless mechanism that may jump the track and crush everything in its path. The good life is one "motivated by love and good will and guided by knowledge." The teacher must promote clear thinking. The most important technique of living is the recognition of problems and their solution by thinking which is based on truth. The detection of falsehood, distortion, bias, propaganda, misleading of every kind, and the recognition of 582 truth, whatever its source, is basic to all constructive social functioning. Do our students have the opportunity to think�to put thinking into action, by learning to choose, to evaluate, to discuss, to debate, and to weigh all factors in a situation? Relatively too much attention is being given to mere memorizing, to the neglect of judgment and the power of independent thinking. Teachers need a better background of understanding about people and their individual needs. They need a greater determination to labor at the task with the full backing and support of all of us. This will mean that many teachers will need to extend and broaden their education. Wide reading on current issues of the day is needed, reading critically in an effort to discern truth from error. This does not mean that teachers should have no concern for the past. But it does mean that the great ideas of the past must come alive and become dynamic in the present. History is meaningless unless it has a current application. It is hard, for example, to find an application for these words of Thomas Jefferson: I have sworn upon the altar of the living God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. Error is dangerless so long as truth is free to combat it. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. Or, the words of Horace Mann, as he took office as secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Education: The path of usefulness is opened before me�God grant me annihilation of selfishness, a mind of wisdom, a heart of benevolence. Or, his words to a graduating class at Antioch, which words were inscribed on his tomb: Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity. Have our classes been so dulled and drugged by second-hand text book words that they are out of touch with reality? Is our instruction life-giving? "Man does not live by bread alone." He is a spiritual, as well as a physical being, a creature with a personality and a soul stamped with the imperishable image of God. Good teaching, the kind demanded today�is justified by the degree to which it helps people to develop their spiritual capacities, their qualities of human kindness, their devotion to ideals of truth and justice and beauty in all their relationships. Let us therefore follow after the things that make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another (Romans 14:19). Fort Lemhi Mission, Idaho CHAPTER IN REVIEW Dorothy Clapp Robinson IDDEN among the rocks and brush in a high valley in East Central Idaho, are some old, old apple trees around which centers one of the most interesting chapters in Latter-day Saint colonization. 'These trees were set out about ninety years ago by members of the Salmon River mission which was established in 1855 and abandoned in 1858. Although of short duration and seemingly a failure, this attempt at colonization left more lasting marks on the face of Idaho than a few antiquated apple trees, or the remnant of a mud wall which still stands. A county, a valley, a mountain range, a mountain pass, a national forest, an Indian reservation, and a tribe of Indians all bear the name given to their fort by those early Latter-day Saint missionaries who reached back into pre-American history for that name. John E. Reese says, "Being twenty-two days in making the journey which was similar in many respects to the exploits of King Limhi, who led a company from the City of Lehi-Nephi to Zarahemla [of Book of Mormon fame] was their journey thither, that they named their fortification for him." The word Limhi was quickly corrupted to Lemhi, and, as such, stands on the geography and in the history of the State of Idaho. The following is given to show how deeply the word is fixed in the thought patterns of the people. The author of this article asked an old pioneer of the State what the Indians called the Lemhi Valley before the Mormons went there. His answer came quickly, "They called it Lemhi. That is an Indian word." Viewed through the softening influence of years, colonization seems a blend of romance and adventure. There may have been adventure in the Lemhi settlement, but there could have been very little romance, for the first settlers were all men. It was in the spring of 1855, only eight years after the first entry of the saints into Salt Lake Valley, that a picked group of twenty-seven men were called to go into the wilds of what is now Idaho to establish a mission among the Lamanites. Contrary to common belief, however, they were not sent specifically to the Salmon River basin. An advance party selected this site. Of these men, Thomas S. Smith, of Farmington, was appointed mission president, and David Moore, mission clerk and historian. The missionaries met near Farmington, and, in May 1855, set their faces north. Each man was required to provide his own transportation and to carry his own equipment and sufficient supplies to last a year. In the caravan there were eleven wagons and forty-six head of oxen, besides the riding horses and some cows. The company traveled north, goPage 583 ing through Malad Valley, over the divide and, eventually, down into Portneuf Canyon and on to the Snake River by means of an old ferry boat near what is now Ferry Butte. They followed along the western banks of the Snake as close as lava, brush, and rocks would permit, until they reached Eagle Rock, now Idaho Falls. There they turned north and west, passed Market Lake, on Birch Creek, and, after crossing the divide, rode at last into the valley that was their rendezvous. Their camp was about three miles from the present town of Tendoy. These colonists may or may not have known that this valley was the birthplace of the immortal Sacajawea and the home of her people, Photograph Courtesy Idaho State Chamber of Commerce the Shoshones. About fifty years before the Latter-day Saints arrived, she had led the Lewis and Clark expedition into the valley on the way to the Pacific Coast, and there she had been reunited with her family. In all likelihood, the colonists knew that the valley was a primitive thoroughfare used by roving bands of Indians, among which were the Bannocks and the Nez Perce. It seems plausible that this fact may have influenced the selection of the site, as the purpose of the missionaries was to convert the Lamanite and to teach him the ways of civilization. Snagg, who was chief of the Shoshones, was either a cousin or a nephew of Sacajawea, and became a great friend of the missionaries.

If the interest of the relatives of the Bird Woman in religion and civilization had not been so fleeting, this story might have had a different ending. However, until late in the year 1857, the Indians and missionaries were on the best of terms. S was always the case with Latter-day Saint colonizers, the men of this company made haste to start farming. They arrived in the valley June 14, and, by the 22d, had planted ten acres of com, peas, and potatoes. Some of the ditches they dug are still in use. Claims have been made that they harvested the first wheat raised in Idaho, but that seems to be a fallacy as the Reverend Spalding, in his mission at the mouth of the Clearwater, had raised wheat prior to this date. The grasshoppers, or crickets, were very numerous that summer of 1855 and, by August, it became evident that there would be little, if any, seed for the next spring. Accordingly, a party of men left for Salt Lake Valley to bring back seed and additional supplies. When these men returned to Fort Lemhi in November of that year, three of them brought their wives back with them, and one, David Moore, brought his daughter Louisa. Thus romance came to this outpost of civilization. Louisa later became the wife of Lewis W. Shurtliff, and old timers tell of her wonderful wedding. In the meantime, there had been a killing frost September 5, which further endangered their supplies. President Smith sent another party to "the settlements" for food and seed. These men returned in early summer, 1856, bringing with them twenty-two more settlers, all men. With all the work of farming and THE LEMHI MISSION, IDAHO stock raising, the men did not forget the purpose for which they had come. A mission school was established, with classes three times a week. Sundays were spent in special services of prayer and
