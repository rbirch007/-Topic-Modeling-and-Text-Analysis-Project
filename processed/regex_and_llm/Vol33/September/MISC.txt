AUTUMN HILLS Grace Zenor Pratt It seems but yesterday I walked across the hills And it was summer... But today a soft and purple mist Has crept across their blueness, while The blazing touch of winter's breath Has changed to bright and shining glory The path of summer's death. All this bright splendor I would somehow keep, Like some sweet, cherished dream to hold In pictured memory. There is one hidden secret I should like to know� How autumn hills can make one strangely yearn, Why autumn's magic touches heartstrings so! There are no words to paint these flaming shades, No haunting music to express my need� That autumn's transient beauty may live on Unchanged by time or winter's icy need. I only know when her last, lovely, scarlet leaf Shall flutter by on some unfaltering breath, It is a symbol of some mighty plan, And beauty lives beyond the summer's death. The Cover: "Mouth of the Middle Fork, Salmon River, Idaho."
