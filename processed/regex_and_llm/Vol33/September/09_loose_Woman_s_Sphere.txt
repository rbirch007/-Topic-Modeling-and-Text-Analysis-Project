Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon HEN American women, after gaining suffrage, assumed their place and responsibility in local and national affairs, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, an outstanding feminist leader, wrote these lines: Not for herself, though sweet the thought of freedom, Not for herself, though dear the new-won power, But for the child who needs a noble mother, For the whole people needing one another, Comes woman to her hour. RS. AMY BROWN LYMAN, former General President of the Relief Society, is the new president of the Utah chapter, National Order of Women Legislators. While serving in the Utah House of Representatives in 1923, Mrs. Lyman promoted the measure which empowered the regents of the University of Utah, and the board of trustees of the Utah Agricultural College to assist faculty members in these institutions to procure old-age annuities.

Making rules to safeguard both the mothers' and their own interests, they blacklist undesirable homes, and discipline girls who raid refrigerators or into drawers. When mothers complained that company distracted girls' attention from their duties, the Cadets ruled out the company.

VOL. 33 SEPTEMBER 1946 NO. 9 Records of Service S each new Relief Society season approaches, there appears before every woman member of the Church a new horizon for her individual development and a new opportunity for her growth through unselfish service. In almost every community in the Church today, however, there are numbers of women who are not: active members of Relief Society and whose time is not fully occupied with other Church duties. While Relief Society needs the support of all Church women, these inactive women need Relief Society even more. They need the satisfaction that comes to one who helps the less fortunate; they need the knowledge which comes from gospel study and discussion; they sorely need the close companionship of Latter-day Saint women who are constantly growing through a continual giving of self. Nor should women wait until their children ate grown before affiliating with the Society. If each girl in the Church would become active in Relief Society as a bride, her married life would be enriched, and she would carry into her everyday living an understanding and a spirit which would aid her in establishing and maintaining a home true to Latter-day Saint principles. This mortal existence is a time of probation, a time of testing, and, once the shades of this life are drawn, there is no returning to add to one's accomplishments. There Page 598 will be time, however, for regrets over wasted hours. 'There will be time for heartaches over misdeeds or omitted good deeds. There will be time to weigh the blessings which might have come from service in Relief Society against social functions or other activities. She who preferred to stand alone here, asking no help and offering none, may stand 'alone there, a benefactor to no one. Her earthly record will be closed. Some records will look thin and tattered, soiled and smudged. Others' records will reveal a bright, brave page here and there, fading into an indolent scrawl. There will be some records, however, well-bound and filled with pages of indelible beauty glowing with the small, daily acts of helpfulness and kindness, radiating a spirit of love written in unselfish and tireless devotion to the Church. Add to these pages of service for others, the greatest chapter of all for a woman an immortal accounting of true motherhood and that woman will have made an everlasting record of righteousness, one in which she may rejoice in the times to come. For, from service given beyond and above one's own affairs, will come an added, rich reward. May each woman in the Church determine, this coming season, to write a record of imperishable beauty, and encourage her sisters around her to do the same.. M. C. S. Notes to the field. Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 3, 1946 CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on fast Sunday evenings, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evening of fast day in November. Fast day in November this year will occur November 2, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the anual ward Relief Society conference.
Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of fast day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society Conference.
It is recommended:
1. That each ward conference be attended by a representative of the stake board who should be present at both the officers' meeting and the general session.
2. That each conference consist of two meetings:
a. An officers' meeting to be attended by the ward executive officers, special workers and class leaders, the ward bishop or his representative, and the visiting stake board member.
b. A general session for all Relief Society members and for the general membership of the ward.
The purposes of the officers' meeting are to discuss problems confronting the ward Relief Society; and to provide opportunity for the stake board member to evaluate the condition of the ward Society; and to advise, instruct, and stimulate the ward officers. In order to accomplish the purposes of the meeting, some stakes prepare a questionnaire or present and discuss data from the last annual report. At least one hour should be allowed for this meeting and, in some instances, a longer period may be required. The time for holding the officers' meeting is optional with wards, but should be at a time convenient for the visiting stake board member and bishop. For example, this meeting may be held immediately preceding the general session, as heretofore suggested, the previous evening, or at some other time convenient for the bishop and visiting board member. This officers' meeting, held in connection with the ward conference, may constitute the monthly ward preparation meeting for the month in which the conference is held.
In order to ensure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that advance announcement of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members, particularly, should be urged to attend.
A suggestive program for use at ward conferences will be sent to ward and stake presidents in bulletin form. Page 599
