A Shelter for Their Hearts Maryhale Woolsey MADGE had known it would M come, known that the storm must break. It could only be a matter of time time, and a final inciting incident. And there seemed nothing she could do about it. Vaguely she blamed herself... And, yet, she knew that if anyone was to blame, it was Coralee's mother. For, after all, Coralee was a younger edition of Carol Santley, gaily thoughtless and selfish and irresponsible. Carol always had played the pretty martyr to her babyish golden haired daughter, bemoaning the insufficiency of the annuity her late husband had provided her which, with any capable management at all, would have been ample for the comfort of both. Carol was accustomed to deposit her child, now and again, with relatives or friends, for times varying from an afternoon to a couple of weeks or more, so that she could go away fora "rest." Still, Coralee adored her mother, and was evidently bent on following in her footsteps. Coralee's and Link's had been one of those swift, unconsidered, wartime romances. Link had been barely nineteen, Coralee not yet seventeen, when they had decided to be married before Link went into the service. And, if Madge and Ken Walters had had misgivings at their son's choice of a wife, they had not had the heart, at such a time, to voice them. Carol, suddenly relieved of responsibility for Coralee, following her marriage to Link, promptly found a romance for herself and went off gaily honeymooning to Mexico. There, in a small seaside town, she and her new husband found Carol's annuity sufficient for two, and there they remained. And Coralee liked living as a guest at the home of Link's parents. And so it had begun. At first, Madge hadn't minded at all. Coralee was lovable and cuddlesome, and her presence relieved the deadly quiet of the house after Link had gone away. 'Then, after awhile, there was the baby, Tad. He was round and pink and adorable, and Coralee worshipped him and turned over to Madge the less attractive duties pertaining to his care. Coralee could never achieve the preparation of Tad's formula without burning her fingers, or breaking a bottle, or spilling something; so next day she'd beg prettily, "Would you mind, Mother Walters fixing his food this time? I'm so nervous about it, I just know I�ll have another accident if I try!" Finally, Madge, on her own initiative, took over making the formula, finding it more convenient and time-saving to do so than to be interrupted in her own work at inopportune times. With the baby's laundry, Coralee would dawdle over it and get hopelessly befuddled among wet heaps of shirts and nighties and didies, and waste precious soap. She might then be called to the telephone by one of her girl friends, to further delay the program. And Madge, in desperation Page 601 would finish the washing-or find her kitchen impossible to work in when she was ready to start dinner preparations. Those were the things that had first begun to irk Ken. "Can't the girl do anything?" he growled. "Leave her to it. I'm not having you imposed upon any more!" A couple of times he spoke his mind to Coralee, and she wept. Then Ken would be embarrassed and ashamed, and, in two days, things would be back where they had been before. Tad was almost three when Link, at last, came home to stay. He was miraculously whole and_ sound, miraculously like the boy who'd gone away except for that older, grave look, deep in his eyes. And Coralee didn't notice that, it seemed. To Coralee, Link was exactly as he had been four years ago, carefree, eager to dance and play, go riding in the car, to consume hot dogs and ice cream at wayside stands. HOSE first weeks, Madge and Ken were more than willing to relieve the young couple of parental cares. 'They were eager for Link to have a period of rest, of fun and freedom. But later, after Link? always happiest when tinkering with the "innards" of automobiles got a mechanic's job in a big garage? then his mother and father expected that the young people would think about a home for themselves. And when the idea didn't seem to occur to them, Ken took Link aside one evening and rather pointedly made the suggestion. Madge guessed what had happened when she discovered certain new wrinkles of puzzlement between Link's eyebrows. Then they began, really, to learn about the housing shortage, which had formerly been a phrase they read of in the newspapers and heard in other people's conversations. It hadn't meant a great deal to them. Now, suddenly, it was a very real, a personal, and individual menace. The friction in the Walters household as in many another home grew and grew, as week after week went by, and Link and Coralee didn't find a home. Link wanted a house, but Coralee was all for an apartment, a hotel apartment preferably, with conveniences and "services"... None such was available, especially to a couple with a small boy. The few vacancies they did find, Coralee rejected. One was "a smelly place," another "too drab for words," still another "too impossible," in one way or another. Time passed and Link had been home seven months. There was-a grimness around Ken's mouth that Link seemed to watch furtively and turn away from. Coralee still played around, going to matinees with girl friends, or alone; spending hours shopping for "wacky" hats, nylons, toys for Tad, shirts for Link. And, when Link would happen to get home before Coralee did and find Madge tending Tad bringing in his newly laundered, small clothes, or ironing them then Link would go around looking worried and angry and sullen. Not infrequently, he and Coralee would have a quarrel; but Coralee did not mend her ways. The last straw came when Tad ruined Ken's choicest peonies. The plants were large and beautiful, and Ken had made plans to enter the  A SHELTER FOR THEIR HEARTS lee had Played with Tad out in the back yard, letting him dig "in the nice, soft dirt." Madge heard them come in, heard Coralee chatter gay baby talk in the kitchen while she gave Tad his noon meal of canned junior foods, Then, all at once, Coralee had come to "T''ve put Tad down for his nap, Mother. I'm going to run down to Jean's for a few minutes to see her new suit. I'll not be gone an hour, but I thought I'd better let you now," Just like that, Madge thought, too listless even to feel resentful. She Sot up, wrapped herself in a warm to be and went to the kitchen to get a bowl of hot soup, sighing at the kitchen disarray as she went weakly back to bed. A little later, she fell asleep, and, when she awakened, it was to hear Ken driving past the windows. The house was ominously quiet. Remembering, Madge hurried to look for Tad. Eis crib was empty. She heard Link's coupe stop in front of the house, and a shout from Ken, behind. Madge hastened to the kitchen door, and from there she Tad was standing by the peony bed, his face upturned to Ken's in bewilderment and fright. The hacked buds and stems of the peonies lay scattered on the ground at his feet: his chubby hands stil] grasped his toy hoe. Ken's face was purple with Tage. After that one angry outburst, he seemed to have turned 603 speechless, the drive, and Coralee came running behind him. Thought, all the players perfectly cued for a climactic scene. Spoke, Daddy, it's Just a shame. | ty Tad?" Link said, "Where have you been, Coralee?" "At Jean's, darling. I didn't mean to be so long?" "You mean, you left Tad with Mom, when she Was so sick?" "I only meant to be away a few minutes?" Ken snorted, "Few minutes! You've no more idea of time than? than that kid has of gardening! Nor of responsibility of any kind." He glanced suddenly towards the house, saw Madge in 'the doorway, and choked into silence. "I�m sorry," Madge said. "I went to sleep. Tad must have climbed out of his bed..." "You were entitled to sleep," Ken. Answered her, his lips grim. Coming you feeling?" "Better, dear," Madge said, dreading the next few minutes, for Link had picked up Tad and was following Ken into the house, by way of the kitchen which was, frankly, a mess! Coralee came after, just as Ken, looking around Said to Madge, "You go back to bed. We'll take cate of this," She went, hearing Link's incredulous, "But, honey! Couldn't you even wash up the breakfast things?" And Coralee's plaintive, "Darling, I meant too, Really I did. But I had to tend Tad all morning?" "Tad's Gramma,' Ken - said, "tends him and gets her work done, too!" "I know. She's wonderfully efficient, isn't she?' Coralee spoke with wistful admiration. "I never hope to be half as smart about? things." Sarcastically, Ken said, "I guess you never will be, if you never begin to try. But you'd better start to begin, night now. Tad's Gramma is through being your baby tender, see? When a couple start getting a family, they should think of of a place for it." "Dad," Link began, "we've been looking for a place?" And Coralee interrupted with, "Just as soon as we can find something suitable?" "'Something suitable!" Ken snapped. "Has it ever occurred to you that my wife and I might like 'something suitable,' also, and that we have priority here?" Madge was sliding in between the cool sheets of her bed. The electric silence seemed to reach through the house, to follow her into this room; the air seemed to prickle with it. After what seemed a long time, she heard Link say, "I see your point, Dad. You're dead right, too. We should take what we can get... And we will. Soon. Coralee, find a couple of aprons. Right now, we'll start on these dishes." Link took the next day off from his work, and he and Coralee went house hunting, taking Tad along. Before noon, they were back. Coralee's face was unhappy; her eyes were red, and tears had streaked her cheeks with mascara. "We found a house, Mom," Link said. "Folks just moving out. It's out at the edge of town, on Knowlton Drive. Not much, but?" "Oh, it's awful!" Coralee began to cry again. "Mother Walters, it's a horrible place that nobody nice would have! I'll be ashamed to be seen in it to have our friends see us there!" "It'll be a roof over our heads," Link said, "and it will give us a chance to be adults, instead of irresponsible kids." "I never, never,' Coralee stated, "could take care of it all by myself. And Link says we can't afford a housekeeper even if we could find one." "Darling," Link told her sarcastically, "I wasn't bad at K. P. At times. If it's two babies I've got, instead of a wife and one baby, I guess I can make out somehow." "You're horrid to me!" Coralee cried, and ran away to sob on her pillow. INK confided to his mother details regarding the "find." "It is shabby and run-down," he confessed. "Rather rough tenants it seems to have had; I don't blame old Harlow for not wanting to do any fixing up. "Take it or leave it,' he said." "Anson Harlow," Madge nodded. "Yes, he'd be like that, knowing some desperate family would take it as it is." "Broken windows," Link went on, "broken old stove in the kitchen, and goodness knows what the furnace is like. It doesn't look good to me! But we'll only need to use it for a few months. We'll have to buy furniture, of course." He called, "Coralee! We might  A SHELTER FOR THEIR HEARTS as well do a little shopping this afternoon, want to?" Coralee came back, somewhat cheered. "Link, let's buy a glass topped table, and one of those corner whatnots and some lovely figurines to put in it!" "T hate to be a wet blanket, honey," Link said. "But we'd better start with the necessities; we haven't much cash, you know, and there's a limit to our credit." "But Jean and Ed have?" "Jean," Link said, impatiently, "worked all the time Ed was gone, Coralee, and she banked every cent of her allotment, and more out of her own salary. That makes it simpler for them, now." "But, Link!" | Coralee looked hurt. "I couldn't work, could I? Having Tad, and?" She turned appealingly to Madge. "Tad's worth three bank accounts," Madge said hastily. "Link isn't complaining; he's simply stating facts. You and Link will have to start, as he says, with essentials." Ken, upon learning what had developed, looked thoughtful. After dinner he went away somewhere by himself, and when, shortly after his return, a telephone call came for Link, Madge had an idea Ken had been up to something. The caller was Anson Harlow. He'd decided, he said, that if Link would sign a year's lease for the small house, he'd repair the broken windows, put in a new range, and in the fall would see that the furnace was in good order. Link agreed. Coralee wailed, "Oh, Link! A year! In that hovel? I-?I just couldn't bear it!" Link gave her a queer, long look ?almost, Madge thought, the look 605 he might have given a stranger whose behavior had displeased him. When he spoke, his tone was icy. "Sorry, Coralee. Tad and I think we'll make out all night. We suppose we'll have a lot of things to learn, of course. You can learn along with us, if you care to." For once Coralee seemed unable to turn on either tears or charm. She just sat. Madge's heart ached for them all. What would happen to them, she wondered, thinking of the numerous war-wed couples rushing through divorces; of the little children, hurt and bewildered. No... No! She cried in her heart. Not Link... Not Tad... Not even Coralee... For Coralee did love Link! But? what would happen! They moved to the small house a week later. They had bought a good rug, dull, soft blue, for their living-room; a sofa and chairs, deep cushioned and comfortable, in brocade of rose and gold-beige. Coralee's colors, and they were lovely, but they turned sickly in the shabby setting of the room, where darkened, streaked wallpaper in a heavy floral pattern, and nondescript brown woodwork were depressingly evident. Even the tall, old, mirrored mantel had been painted that dull deep brown; it towered grimly over everything like an evil spirit. In the kitchen, long ago, the walls and woodwork had been painted a "serviceable" dark gray, the ceiling a lighter gray. Coralee's blithely selected chrome and red leatherette breakfast set wouldn't have been so bad there, except that the linoleum was checkered tan and green, with lines of orange. Madge 'groaned when she saw it, but Ken said, "It's their indigestion, I guess. They'll have to find the cure for it or endure it." Madge had wanted to help the youngsters get settled, but was too weak after her illness, and Ken forbade her doing any extra work at all. In fact, he found a business trip to the Coast a sudden and urgent necessity, and insisted that Madge should go along with him. MACE and Ken were away for a month. On their second day back home, they had an early dinner and drove out "to see how the kids were making out." Link met them at the door. "Well, if it isn't the gadabouts!" he greeted them... Adding in a slightly embarrassed manner, "We'd sort of hoped you'd not show up for a few more days. But come in? we're almost ready for you, anyway!" They stepped inside and began to see his meaning. Coralee, in a pair of paint-besmeared old slacks, and with her head tied in a gay bandanna, greeted them from atop a stepladder at the farthest window. "What have you done?" Madge exclaimed with incredulous pleasure as she looked around. "Is this the same place, or isn't it?" Ken said. "Did you two uh inherit a mint or just rob one, or? what?" For gone was the garish wallpaper, gone the depressing brown woodwork. The walls were restful spaces of clear pale gray-blue that seemed to recede and enlarge the room. Over creamy white window frames hung the gay new drapes, whose colors repeated those of the furniture and brightened the whole effect; everything seemed charmingly right. Link and Coralee were laughing almost boisterously in their pride. "A fortune is what we came into, all right!" Link agreed. "A smart wife... Being more valuable than rubies or whatever the saying is! I know what it means, anyway!" he finished. The look in his eyes was something at which to rejoice. "I never dreamed I could do? things like I've been doing," Coralee said happily. "And Link he's not half bad, himself." With significant, relieved glances at each other, Madge and Ken followed through the doorway into a vision of gleaming new white enamel-finished cabinets in the kitchen. '"Where's Tad?" Ken asked. "Out in back. We've fenced him in," Link said. "Come, see our young man at work!" Tad had heard their voices. He stood expectantly just inside his small play yard, and when they appeared, he began to jump up and down. Amid laughter, Ken remarked, "The kid's got the right idea." Disregarding his good clothes, he went over and knelt in the sand beside the boy. Watching, Madge put her arm around Coralee's shoulders. The girl drew closer in quick response. "You know, Mother," she confided, "this is a kind of a victory, isn't it? What we've done here, I mean... Link and I. We're so? happy, doing things together!" Madge thought to herself, that is marriage, Coralee. But she only said, "It's the together-ness that does it, dear. That's the important thing." The rest she left unsaid; they would discover it themselves, one of these days....  - Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 6 Synopsis: Enid Drage, widow of Tom Drage, killed in a factory accident, feels a little strange in the small town where she is going to teach. She takes her small daughter to school the first day and feels a certain resentment on the part of the teacher. She is sure, later, that the teacher is not being fair with her child. She writes her a letter, then decides to pray about the matter. Her eyes to see the beautiful September sunlight streaming through the small east window. She yawned and stretched herself, feeling that it was good to be alive. The heartache of the night before was like dew that had disappeared in warmth and light. She slipped out of bed, picked up the envelope, and tore it into small pieces, letting them fall into the wastepaper basket. Three days later she was sitting at her desk, just as she had been that first day, when she saw Sharon coming through the door. Only now her face was alight, her eyes shining. "Mommie," she called gaily, coming into the room, running toward her mother, "Mommie!" "What is it, darling?" Enid asked her, her own heart filling with joy at the sight of her. Sharon was neat her now and she cried, "What do you think? Miss Hare came up to me today and put her arms around me and said, "You lovely little girl' " Enid choked. Now, there was no need to hold back the tears. Tears T HE next morning, Enid opened of joy, even tears of grief, were a purification. When she had let them fall profusely, she dried her eyes again and managed to say, "You see, I told you. She only needed to know you." She didn't add _ that prayer had helped. But someday she would tell her daughter.  Everything seemed right, and the days passed swiftly. Winter came and passed. Soon more years had gone. Incredible as it seemed, Sharon was first in junior high... And then in high school. Miss Nobbitt's health was failing, and the doctor told her she would have to be careful of her heart. Enid tried to watch over her as much as possible, but she was a hard patient to wait on. One cold, winter night, Enid stood in her landlady's kitchen, making her some chicken soup. Miss Nobbitt insisted upon coming out every few minutes to see how it was going. Finally, Enid said, "Now, listen here, young woman. You go in and rest. I can cook almost as well as you can. And if I can't... Well, all the more reason why I need the practice." "Pshaw," grunted the other woman, "you just want to make me out an ailing invalid and I won't have it" "I should say you won't. That's what I'm trying to avoid. Please do be careful... Just for a little while. Then you'll be perky as ever." Page 607 608 "Oh, you with your pleading, pretty eyes. I still don't see how you've managed to escape the men these many years." Enid brushed a curl from her forehead, said laughingly, "Well, for your information, Mr. Fletcher has asked me several times to go out with him." "Mr. Fletcher, the banker! Hmm. And what excuse did you give for not going?" "Oh, I'm good on excuses. I always have so much to do!" "Taking care of me, I suppose." The younger woman turned toward her quickly, "Oh, no. Of course not. That is one of the pleasantest things I do. I just don't care to go..." Miss Nobbitt was thoughtful as she said, "You could do worse. He'd give you a good life... That beautiful house on the corner..." Enid put the chicken onto the waiting platter, as she answered, "I like this house." "The corner you have of it isn't much, I'd say. If you'd swallow your pride and move in here, we'd both be better." "No. We wouldn't; I'd feel I was taking advantage of you. It's better this way." As the other woman_ turned, wearily, to go into her own room, she made one parting remark, "It might make a difference in Sharon's life...." Enid paused a moment, then shrugged her shoulders. Sharon understood. She wouldn't want to take something that wasn't hers any more than her mother would. She was a level-headed child, and very wise for fifteen. Enid was just putting the dishes on the table (since "Manda insisted they eat there), when Sharon came in, her long bob falling about her shoulders, her cheeks pink and glowing from the cold. "Hi, Mom," she greeted her mother, "how's Aunt *Manda?" She looked into the other room as she spoke, and Miss Nobbitt answered, "I'm just fine. Or will be when you come here and kiss me." The girl laughed and proceeded to kiss the older woman, affectionately. Then, she said, "I've got to hurry. I'm invited to a party and it's going to be a ritzy affair. Up at the Arnold's." Her mother's eyes widened, "You mean Sally Arnold's place?" "T mean no other." "Well, you are rather getting into high society. How did that happen?" "Oh, Sally's always been nice to me, but today some of the other girls who weren't invited were talking about her, saying she was a snob and stuff. They asked if I was invited and I said 'No,' but I still thought she was a nice girl and had nothing against her. I guess it got back to her because out of a clear sky she asked me to come. "Well, hurry then, child, hurry," Miss Nobbitt told her, "and you'd better wear that new blue taffeta dress. It brings out your eyes." EN ID hurriedly put things on the table. She didn't say anything, but she was well aware of the unusual excitement in her daughter's face, the happiness that hadn't been there before. Enid supposed she had always known that was the set Sharon had wanted to be in, should have been in, but Enid hadn't fully FAITH IS A HERITAGE realized how much it had meant to Sharon.; Instead of sitting down with them to eat, Enid first went into her own small rooms to take Sharon's blue taffeta dress from the closet, to make sure it was pressed and in order. As she carried it back with her, she held it against her heart lovingly, She assisted Sharon with her hair pressing the soft, natural waves into the gleaming bob. She zipped the dress up the side so that it emphasized the slim, girlish waist. When Sharon was ready, she whirled around, laughing, letting the full, billowing skirt go out like a bright balloon. "Do I look pretty enough?" she asked, stopping suddenly, her eyes serious. "Do I look as nice as the other girls will?" "If you weren't prettier than any of them in the first place," Miss Nobbitt said dryly, "I might say I don't know, but since you are, and since I'm sure none of them has a prettier dress, I guess there is only one answer." "Oh, you spoil her out of all reason," Enid protested, smilingly. And Miss Nobbit nodded, "Yes, I know. As if you didn't." "It hasn't hurt her so far," the gitl's mother answered, looking at her daughter, "And it just hadn't better, either." The two women talked seriously about it when the girl had left, wondering how much love and affection could be showered upon a child without turning her head. "It's frost, not sun, that kills a flower," Miss Nobbit insisted, "and it's not love, but lack of it, that spoils a child." 609 "I don't know," Enid said hesitantly, "I don't want her to be selfish... Or arrogant." "Oh, don't even give it a thought. Sharon was born wise and sweet. She'll always be that." "I do so hope she will." Enid's words were fervent, almost like a prayer as she began getting ready to go to her own apartment. She was awake when Sharon came home about eleven. She heard the laughter of young voices outside, heard the gay "goodnights" and she felt happy deep within her. She knew there were mothers whose own happiness seemed to come before their children's, but she was not one of them. If Sharon was happy, she was happy. She switched on the light as she heard the step at the door, sat up in bed, waiting to see the light in the girl's face, eager to hear the details of the party. The door opened and Sharon stepped in. Her face was bright, but only for a moment. She looked about her, and she seemed suddenly to droop. "What is it?" Enid asked her. "What is the matter? Didn't you have a good time? I heard you all laughing... I thought..." "Oh, yes, yes, of course I had a good time," Sharon said quickly, a note of irritation in her voice. "A wonderful time. It was the nicest home I've ever seen. They had beautiful dishes on the table, like those Miss Nobbit keeps in her china cupboard. They had a big fire in the fireplace..."" She stopped, and there were swift, gleaming tears in her eyes. "But what is it, darling?" Enid asked her again, climbing out of bed, going toward her. But Sharon did not come to her to explain whatever was bothering her. In fact, she seemed to draw into herself, to hold herself more aloof. She replied simply, "It's nothing. I I just wonder sometimes We can't ever have friends here. I can't ever entertain. And it won't ever be any different..." Enid caught a note of bitterness in the young voice. She felt as if something had struck her heavily. There was nothing she could say. She could only change the subject, pretend that she hadn't heard. Yet, long after the young girl had undressed and crawled into bed, the words kept burning themselves over and over in Enid's brain: "And it won't ever be any different." She put her hand on the warm, soft flesh of the young girl's arm. Tears were in her own eyes now as she whispered to herself: "It just might be different. It might be." (To be continued)
