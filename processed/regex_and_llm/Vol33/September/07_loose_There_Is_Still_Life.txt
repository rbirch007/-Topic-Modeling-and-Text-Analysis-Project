There Is Still Life Frances C. Yost gay wind, in sportive play, frisked the high tree tops, and whirled September's leaves of red and gold, to welcome in an Indian summer. Dessie Bartlett, widowed seven years, sat on the step of her back porch. Her three children, like mushrooms, clustered around her. All eyes were on a finished painting Dessie held in her outstretched arms.. "Mother, it's perfect! I never really noticed the beautiful view from our back yard until you painted this picture," LaPrele, age twelve, stated equably. "It's tops, Mom. Why, old Baldy Mountain looks bully! I wonder how he likes his picture taken? He seems so solemn and wise," chuckled Foster, who was more man than boy for all his fourteen years. Then he added seriously, "It'll sure take the blue ribbon at the fair!" "It's awful pretty," spoke up Joyce, the youngest of the three. "Please take it to the fair, Mommie." "It would be the prize winner if I were the judge," LaPrele said with emphasis. "A fair judge studies all entries," laughed Dessie. "But if you children think it's good, we'll just enter it and find out." Dessie beamed on her brood. "It does have good balance, and the perspective is perfect, if I may say so. It is colorful; the little stream and the quaint bridge add a touch, somehow. I might as well put my initials in the corner with ink and call it finished." Page 590 'sobs. "I�ll get the ink right now. Today's the last day to take exhibits to the fair." Joyce raced into the house. "I�ll write it in the house!" Dessie called. Joyce, who was already out of earshot, didn't hear her mother. Before anyone knew what was happening, she was back with the inkwell and pen. At the door she ran into Foster. "Look out, Sis! Grab that ink!" Foster shouted. It was too late. The glass container bounced out of Joyce's tiny hand, over Dessie's shoulder, and broke. A pool of jet black ink splashed over the newly finished oil painting. "The picture! It's ruined! Mother!" wailed LaPrele. "Gosh, Mom, can't we do something quick? Won't ink wipe off?" Foster gasped. "I'm afraid not, Son. You see I] just finished touching it up with fresh oils. It would be just a smudge," Dessie stated calmly, then despair closed her throat. Joyce, realizing the great catastrophe she had caused, sobbed brokenheartedly. Dessie, who had laid the ruined painting on the lawn at her feet, put an arm around Joyce to quiet her "I didn't have a chance of winning anyway, Joyce dear. Why, Mrs. Swartz studied art in the East and she is entering a beautiful scene of Niagara. Then VonVleet, the high school art teacher, has a lovely apple blossom sketch. = Mother Oh, THERE IS STILL LIFE doesn't care, really. We'll go to the fair just the same, and you kiddies will probably all get ribbons. How's that?" Dessie wiped the tears from Joyce's eyes. Inwardly, Dessie was _heartsick. She had worked at odd moments all summer to perfect her painting. She felt certain it might have been a prize winner. All during the day she found herself fighting a hard battle to conceal her deep disappointment. For the children must never know how much entering the art exhibit had meant to her. She busied herself, supervising the children as they prepared their entries for the fair. LaPrele pressed her 4-H dress and made certain there were no cat's whiskers sticking out on the French seams. Foster brushed the fur on the two rabbits he was entering. Joyce picked and trimmed the largest, firmest head of lettuce, and washed and bunched carrots from her 4-H garden. When the children left in the afternoon to make their entries, Dessie could hold back her disappointment no longer. She flung herself into the deep, soft chair that had been Roger's. She had thought all day if she could only be alone for a good cry, her pent-up feelings would wash away. Now, somehow, tears would not come. Roger's dear old chair, vacant so many years, seemed to put its arms around her. Dessie's mind, designed for far vision, chose for the moment to dwell on an autumn day seven years past.....air was tangy as cider. Frozen roses hung heavy on their stems. The sun was brassy; even the chirping of the sparrows had an 591 autumnal sound. Dessie stood by the door, dustpan in one hand, broom in the other. Roger had come in unexpectedly. He stood in the doorway unnoticed, until he placed a loving arm about her waist and released her hold on the cleaning utensils. "You've worked long enough today. How about doing something lasting?" "For instance?" Dessie queried, half ashamed to be caught by the one she loved with her hair resembling damp untwined string, rather than the bubblelike cloud of curls she managed to acquire when Roger came home at the usual hour. "Why don't you spend the afternoon painting me a pretty picture of something?" Roger said succinctly. "For instance?" Dessie again questioned, as her mind raced on to the many household tasks she had planned to do during the day. "Flowers!" Roger answered. "My darling, haven't you noticed? The frost is on the pumpkin. There isn't a flower to be had. And, besides, if I wash the kitchen curtains, as I had planned, you will be able to see more scenery than I can capture with a brush," laughed Dessie, modestly. "I want you to paint today, Des-. Sie, I mean it. If I find something suitable, will you paint it today? Please, today!" Roger's voice was pleading. "I�ll make you a wager. If you can find anything around here fit to paint, I'll do my best. In the meantime, please, may I gather up this debris before the wind whips it all through the house again?" Roger had gone out of the house, and came back in a moment with two large dried onions. He moved a square table into the light from the bay window, placed a clean white doily upon the table, a black bowl on the doily, and there he placed the two dried onions, as if they had just rolled themselves up near the bowl. "Dessie, here's the easel all set up, and your paintbox and everything. Just leave your work, I'll... I'll just sit here and watch you." So Dessie dabbed in her oil paints all afternoon, hardly looking up from her easel. It turned out to be their last afternoon spent together, for Roger had taken a sudden heart attack in the night, which had proved fatal. Quiet, home-loving Roger, who had borne the pain from his heart silently through the years, never allowing even ill health to upset their last hours. Dessie recalled the picture of the onions, which, she felt certain, was the poorest type of art. It lacked lovely, bright colors. 'There she had sat, fiddling with a brush, while Roger's very hours were numbered. Dessie had buried the hateful onion picture deep in a trunk in the attic, and life had become as dust and ashes without Roger. Always, she had put on a false front of contentment while her very heart was breaking within her. Now she heard the children's voices. Laying away her feelings on a secret shelf in her mind, she welcomed her children cheerfully. "Everything ready for the fair tomorrow?" "Everything, Mom!" the three chorused. THE day broke clear and bright, with a pungent scent of autumn in the air. Dessie Bartlett and her three children set out early for the fairgrounds. "I suppose you'll want to see your exhibits first?" Dessie questioned, gay asa lark. "Gosh, Mom, an' miss the horse races? We can see em after they're judged," spoke up Foster, quickly. They took in the races, rode the Ferris wheel, and the whirligigs, bought hamburgers and salted peanuts at the concessions, and were munching large twirls of cotton candy when they finally visited the exhibits, late in the afternoon. When Dessie saw the art display she dropped her cotton candy. Her knees seemed fluid at the back. For there, between Mrs. Swartz's Niagara painting and VonVleet's apple-blossom scene, was her own simple, still-life portrayal of the two dried onions! Surely there was a mistake, for a blue ribbon rippled bravely from the picture frame. Dessie bent over to read the writing on a little white card. This still-life painting is awarded first place for excellent contour, perspective, color combination, and its aesthetic quality. Dessie's heart fluttered in her throat. She looked deeply into the faces of her children. In amazement she asked, "How did this get here?" Joyce, the youngest, chose to be spokesman. "LaPrele knew it was in the trunk in the attic. We brought the picture over and entered it for you, Mommie. We knew you'd win if you just had a picture!" Dessie felt her heart sink back into her breast. She looked at the  THERE Is STILL Life picture as if for the first time. There was a contrast of colors, even though they were not vivid reds, blues, and greens! The round bowl, as well as the square table, somehow possessed an artist third dimension! Even the skin on the onions was natural! As her eyes drank in the worth of her own creative art, she felt that Roger was there beside her. Dessie knew, as she gazed at her picture, that as long as she could look upon this very painting, Roger would be there, his presence warming the cockles of her heart. �There is still life!" she murmured.
