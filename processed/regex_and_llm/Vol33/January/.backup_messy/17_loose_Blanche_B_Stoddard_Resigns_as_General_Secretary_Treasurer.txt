Blanche B. Stoddard Resigns as General Secretary-Treasurer THE General Board wishes to express appreciation for the faithful and devoted service of Blanche Black Stoddard as General Secretary-Treasurer from May 22 to October 31, 1945. Because of increased home responsibilities, Sister Stoddard found it necessary to be relieved of the exacting duties of the secretarial office. However, she will continue to serve the Society as a member of the General, Board, where her devotion to Relief Society work, her charming personality, and her gift for leadership will be of great value to the women of the Church. For a biographical sketch and a photograph of Blanche Black Stoddard, see the Magazine for July 1945, page 403. In Memoriam Elder Joseph J Cannon and Elder Burton K. Farnsworth HE members of Relief Society throughout the Church pay tribute at this time to the service and accomplishments of two outstanding leaders?the counselors in the superintendency of the Y. M. M.1. A. Elder Joseph J. Cannon, first assistant general superintendent, died at his home in Salt Lake City, November 4, 1945, after an illness of several weeks. Throughout his life Elder Cannon was an ardent Church worker, serving as a missionary in Sweden, editor of the Millennial Star, superintendent of the Ensign Stake Y. M. M. LA., president of the British Mission, president of the Temple Square Mission, editor of the Deseret News, and author of religious dramas, and in 1937 he was appointed first counselor in the general superintendency of the Y. M. M. I. A.. Members of the Relief Society will remember Elder Cannon particularly for his excellent reports on general conference sessions which have appeared from time to time in the Magazine. The sisters of Relief Society extend love and sympathy to Sister Cannon who assembles the interesting department, "Woman's Sphere." Elder Burton K. Farnsworth, second assistant in the general superintendency of the Y. M. M. LA., passed away October 27, 1945, in Seattle, Washington, where he had gone to attend an M. I. A. Convention. Elder Farnsworth was a loving father, an effective teacher, a dynamic leader, and an exemplar of the work and the faith of the Church. Born in Beaver, Utah, of pioneer parents, he became interested in education at an early age, secured his Ph. D. From the University of California, and became one of Utah's leading school officials and Church executives. We extend to Sister Farnsworth and the family our deepest sympathy in their loss, and our appreciation for the good life of this Latter-day Saint leader. Notes to the field Only One Relief Society General Conference To Be Held Each Year THE General Board announces, as of January 1946, the discontinuance of the custom of holding two general Relief Society conferences each year. Beginning with the year 1946, only one general Relief Society conference will be held a year.
This action has been taken because it is deemed inadvisable to require the sisters to leave their homes and to spend the necessary money to make two yearly trips to Salt Lake City in the interest of Relief Society, as it is felt that the program for the conference can be so arranged that all needed instructions for departmental work and recommendations in all phases of Relief
Society work can be given at one general conference a year.
Since the educational program of Relief Society commences each October and ends the last of May and Relief Society activities are modified in the summer months, it has been decided to hold the general Relief Society conference each year, beginning with 1946, in October?just prior to the semi-annual general conference of the Church.
In view of the fact that hereafter only one general Relief Society conference will be held a year, it is expected that Relief Society officers will put forth every effort to be present at the October annual Relief Society general conference.
