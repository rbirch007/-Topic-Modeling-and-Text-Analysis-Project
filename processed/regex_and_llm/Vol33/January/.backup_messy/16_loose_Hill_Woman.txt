MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS New England Mission MYRTLE BERNARDS, auxiliary supervisor of the New England Mission, reports: "In October of 1944 the Relief Society in the Providence Branch was discontinued because of the lack of members. Three families had moved to Salt Lake City and one to Mississippi. Since the first of the year, however, membership in the branch increased by the baptism of converts and other members moving in. The Relief Society was reopened in March with Sister Alice Lyon as president. One of the rooms in the branch chapel wasn't being used so the new Relief Society made their first project the redecorating of this room for their own use.. "The priesthood members replastered the walls and the Relief Society carried on from there. They had the floors covered with a dark green linoleum, painted the walls and woodwork and made curtains and drapes for the windows. The Providence chapel at one time had been used as a theater and the stage curtains had been left. These curtains were made up into drapes for all the windows in the chapel. This first project has been completed and the members of the Relief Society now have a lovely place to meet in Page 50 and carry on their regular outlined work. The priesthood members of the branch have recently completed a baptismal font and are now beautifying the grounds. On work nights the Relief Society sisters cook dinner at the chapel so the brethren may come right from their work, have dinner, and work outside around the chapel while it is still light. The Relief Society of this branch has greatly helped to increase activity and unity." Eastern States Mission ALBERTA O. DOXEY, president of the Eastern States Mission Relief Society, reports: "I have been able to visit a few of the branches of the mission and on these occasions I have found the sisters laboring under great difficulties due to scattered membership and scarcity of gasoline to reach meeting places but carrying on just the same, and their devotion to duty and accomplishments has indeed been inspiring. Many of our members are actively participating in some war service along with their Relief Society work and we have one member, a widow and officer in the Princeton Branch Relief Society, who has just donated her ninth pint of blood to the American Red Cross. BUFFALO BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY, EASTERN STATES MISSION, CHRISTMAS TOY DISPLAY Photograph submitted by Alberta O. Doxey, President Eastern States Mission Relief Society 52 Some notable accomplishments of some of our branches follow: "The small branch Relief Society at Newburgh, New York, with five active members, sponsored a bazaar on April 14, 1944, which netted a clear profit of $80.75 through the sale of refreshments and many beautiful articles made by the hands of these few sisters. "On August 24, the Altoona Branch Relief Society, with a total of seven active members, held a rummage sale which made a net profit of $61.49. All of the goods sold was donated by members and it was felt that the sale was a success in view of the amount made and the fact that only two months preparation was given to it. "The Buffalo Branch Relief Society had a notable project in September. It was decided that because of the scarcity and poor quality of toys that would be available, the branch Relief Society would make Christmas toys. As a result of many hours of work, quite a collection of adorable stuffed animals, some attractive bean bags, rag dolls, and the beginnings of drums, sets of blocks, costume jewelry for the older girls, scrap books, and other such things were made. Because of the infantile paralysis epidemic in Buffalo, the Crippled Children's Guild Hospital was overcrowded and _ it was thought it would be best to remember these children with the toys. Therefore, 130 separate toys and gifts were made and wrapped and most of them delivered to the children's ward of the Meyer Memorial Hospital on December 23. The remainder of the toys were distributed to the children of the Buffalo Branch at the annual Christmas party on Saturday evening, December 23, 1944. (See picture on preceding page. ) "Another project of interest was that of the Lancaster Branch Relief Society which gathered 106 articles of clothing and packed them and sent them to war refugees.: "In Syracuse, New York, the Syracuse Branch Relief Society held its annual bazaar on November 14. The Fulton, New York, Branch Relief Society joined with a booth of handiwork, as well as food. Such articles as hand-embroidered and crocheted linen of various descriptions were on sale, as well as pies, cakes, cookies, hot dogs, sweet cider, and homemade candy. A fish pond provided entertainment for adults and children as well. Though none of these sisters had ever made or worked on a quilt before, the beautifully appliqued quilt which they had ready for the bazaar sold for $26. The total proceeds from the bazaar amounted to $63.03. "The Philadelphia Branch Relief Society, with an active membership of ten, held a bazaar on December g which was well attended by the branch membership. The entertainment provided by the missionaries laboring in the mission office was especially enjoyable. A profit of $87.12 was realized." Northwestern States Mission HEA STOTT, counselor in the Golden Ridge Branch Relief Society, Great Falls District, reports as follows: "The Golden Ridge Relief Society, consisting of fifteen members, under the able leadership of Sister Armida Hanberg, president, has sponsored two outstanding NOTES FROM THE FIELD entertainments during the 1944-45 season. "A bazaar was sponsored in November. Articles were donated by members and some non-members. The Relief Society collected rags and prepared them for rugs at work meetings. Fourteen rugs were woven and sold at the bazaar. Materials for a quilt were donated by some of the members. It was quilted at work meetings and also sold at the bazaar. When all expenses were paid a profit of $163 was made. "On March 17 the organization sponsored the Annual Day entertainment. A delicious banquet, furnished by the members, was served on a_ beautifully decorated table. The table was arranged with candles, place cards, napkins and favors to carry out the Relief Society colors, blue and gold. All members and partners were in attendance. A dance was enjoyed after the banquet." Australian Mission GERTRUDE SHIRRA, counselor in the Brisbane Branch Relief Society, Queensland, Australia, writes: "Far away here in sunny Queensland we Relief Society sisters wish to express our appreciation to the General Board for the excellent suggestion of a patriotic program honoring our boys in the services, their mothers, wives and children. On Sunday, July 27, 1943, we celebrated our Society's twelfth anniversary by staging this patriotic program in the evening's meeting. "The church was suitably decorated with American and British flags. The congregation sang, "The Star Spangled Banner," and 53 ?National Anthem." The foreword and conclusion were given by Sister Irene Boulton in patriotic costume. A talk was given by Sister May Sharman on 'Our Boys as Missionary Soldiers.' A chorus, 'Lest We Forget,' was rendered by the Singing Mothers and daughters. "A Salute to the Flag," by two boy scouts. All servicemen present and wives and mothers of those away were then honored and had patriotic ribbons pinned on them. "After a talk by Sister Gertrude Shirra on 'Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom,' the congregation joined in singing "Victory Hymn.' "Community hymn _ singing. Which, as a regular feature for the entertainment of our visiting servicemen, follows each Sunday night's service, was then enjoyed, as were also refreshments. Lights were turned out and twelve candles were lit on a three-tiered birthday cake made and donated by Sister Ida Parker. Our president, Sister Harriet Dean, then blew out the candles successfully in one breath and our eldest member of the Relief Society, Sister Anna Gilbert, seventy-six, came forward and cut the cake which was passed to all. "We truly felt our efforts were immeasurably compensated. "Similarly, we celebrated our 13th anniversary and we acclaim both patriotic evenings as memorable occasions. "With Sister Harriet Dean, Sister Ethel Orth, and myself as a presidency, we are extremely happy to' mention that love and unity and enthusiasm pervade all our meetings and because of this we are truly grateful to our loving Father in  MEXICAN MISSION RELIEF SOCIETY President Mary D. Pierce and six Relief Society branch presidents. Antonia Cardenas, Ermita Branch, Mexico City; Salome Flores, San Pedro right: Left to Branch, Federal District; Lucia Morales, Cuautla Branch, State of Morelos; President Mary Done Pierce; Jovita Bravo, Santiago Branch, State of Hidalgo; America Tapia, Toluca Branch, State of Mexico; Clementina Esperon Juarez, Tierra Blanca Branch, State of Veracruz. Heaven who sheds his spirit upon us so bountifully." Mexican Mission "THE following is a report from the Mexican Mission by Sister Mary D. Pierce, president: "The regular semi-annual conference of the Mexican Mission was held May 18, 19, and 20. This year an exposition was held of work completed by the members of our mission in Relief Societies and in their homes. A medium-sized room of the chapel was filled with the articles brought in. Several quilts covered one wall, and the other three were covered by a variety of articles. There were lace tablecloths, embroidery work on towels, pillowcases, luncheon cloths, etc., drawn work, dolls, a child's crocheted dress, and a yellow organdy formal. On a table in the center of the room was a miniature plush living room set, several artificial flowers, a pair of leather gloves and a carved wooden plaque, tinted, of the Prophet Joseph Smith, made by one of the brethren. 'There was also a wall plaque of plaster that was very pretty "Immediately after the second session of the conference, everyone was invited to see the exposition, and a demonstration was given by Sister Pauline Green, under the direction of Sister Mary D. Pierce, NOTES FROM THE FIELD The members were shown how to cover the end of a quilt, so as to be -able to keep it clean longer. Sister Green also told them how to wash a quilt to get the best results. A demonstration was then given on how to paint cloth with crayolas and keep the color in, even after washing. This is very simple and easy to do, and you can make very pretty curtains, bedspreads, etc. With it. Each member was then given printed instructions on how to make pot holders, and two types of aprons that are especially useful. They were also shown the finished articles. "The demonstration ended with Sister Pierce telling the members that the project for the Relief Society this coming year is to have every family in the mission supplied with the number of quilts they need. "The exposition itself continued until the end of the conference. It was a real success, and if the members express a desire for it, we plan on having another one next conference." The mission further reports: "In one of the smaller branches of the Mexican Mission which is located in Atlixco, Puebla, a tiny Indian town about eighty-five miles southwest of Mexico City, a handful of faithful Mexican sisters carry on the regular Relief Society lesson work and activity. A typical example of their work is the special program which was held a short time ago in commemoration of the organization 55 of the Relief Society, March 17, 1842. Sister Mary D. Pierce reports that on the evening of March 19 a special celebration was held at the home of one of the members to which all of their husbands were also invited. "A play was presented centered about the lives of the six Relief Society presidents and each Mexican sister taking part gave a short sketch of the life and activities of one of the presidents. Two recitations and a song then were given with a short skit on temperance ending the program. Ice cream and cookies were served to those present. "The entire program was very simple and unelaborate, but it demonstrates that even among those of humble birth and little or no formal education, the Relief Society can go forward in the true spirit of our Church and carry on activities in which the whole group participates. The sisters of the Atlixco Branch, several of whom do not know how to read nor write, are all very poor and their lives are not much affected by this modern world, but they all joined together in planning and taking part in an evening of enjoyable entertainment in honor of the organization to which they belong. A detailed report of this program was sent in to Sister Pierce at the mission home in Mexico City by Sister Concepcion de Lara, Relief Society president in Atlixco." Lesson DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 15?The United Order Begun and Its Establishment in the Settlements Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, April 2, 1946 Objective: To show how the Lord strives always to have his children seek the more perfect social order of living. THE gospel of Jesus Christ has been sent to the earth for the salvation of mankind. In many cases the saints, and more especially people of the world, have felt that this salvation is meant only for happiness hereafter. While no one can deny that it is the joy of eternal peace that is the ultimate goal of living, yet to insure such a hope it is necessary to labor for salvation in this mortal existence. Such being the case, anything, then, that blights and dwarfs our living here should be alleviated. Sick men cannot work. Poverty-stricken people have no spirit to do, nor can those who are trapped in the wages of sin find joy in future living. The Lord would stamp out all things that shackle the souls of men. This, of course, can only be done when men co-operate. The Lord can show the way, but if the benefits of his counsel are to be realized, his children must learn to listen and obey. Page 56 One of the first things the Master taught the early members of his Church was the need for working together. They were to share, as a group, the sorrows as well as the joys. There would always be poor among them. Just as sure as the rising sun, disappointments and reverses would always be a part of this life, and suffering would come as a result. The widow and the fatherless, the invalid and the weak, all must be assisted. The human heart is tender and the human soul has pride. Both of these must be considered even above the immediate relief of physical want. If they are not, the spirit and will to rise above difficulties breaks, leaving often but the shell of man, the outward form bereft of the divine light of his inner spirit. Few sights are more heart-rending LESSON DEPARTMENT than those to be viewed upon the park benches of great cities?human driftwood, cut free from the moorings of purpose in life. In his wisdom the Lord knows that there can be no true salvation for his people unless the evils of poverty and destitution can be controlled. This was the reason that, in the very beginning of the establishment of his Church in the latter days, he tried to bring about what is known as the law of the United Order or consecration of properties, To fully understand this law and its far-reaching effects swells the heart with love and kindness, for what greater joy is given man than to know he is of worth to others? You will recall that the Prophet Joseph Smith, before the fatal return to Nauvoo, said: "If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to While, as a People, the saints of early days were not quite equal to the responsibility of accepting this higher law of social living, still it has not all been loss to know of their failure. "A man's Teach should exceed his grasp, else what's a heaven for," writes the poet, Robert Browning. The lesson for this month can have but little in the way of history in a few communities in the far west, such as Orderville in Southern Utah. - in practice, the brethren in Missouri got away, in their attempts to set up the United Order, from the principles set out 57 in the revelations. This is also true of the organizations set up here in Utah after the saints came to the valleys. I the departure came by way of the nature of the title which was given to the Church and of the title which was reconveyed to the donor?in Practice it was a sort of "Tend-lease arrangement" as finally developed. The revelations and the instructions of the Prophet called for a fee simple conveyance of real estate by the donor to the bishop and an absolute bill of sale of the personal property of the donor also to the bishop. The bishop then granted back to the donor by the same sort of documents the donor's 'portion,' 'stewardship,' or ' inheritance.' In the Orderville experiment a regular communal organization apparently was set up and all property held in common. The Prophet Joseph had time and time again declared that the Church was not a communal organization. On one occasion, while attending a lecture on socialism, he declared, "I said I did not believe the doctrine." This was in 1843. ? ?President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Today on a Church-wide scale we may be nearing something of a United Order under the present Welfare Plan. Says President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.: Perhaps... When the Welfare Plan gets thoroughly into operation... We shall not be so very far from Carrying out the great fundamentals of the United Order, If the Welfare Plan is fully operative, we shall be able to care for every destitute Latterday Saint wherever he may be (Conference Address, 1942).  The law of consecration or the United Order is not, as some have supposed, a law doing away with Private Ownership. On the contrary, under this law each family in the Church would legally own enough Property to satisfy "his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs, inasmuch as his wants are just?" (Doc. And Coy, 58 82:17; 78:5-8). This would mean that the amount of property. Owned by the various families in the Church would of necessity vary since the needs of families are different. There would be equality, however, in that all families would have their needs. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked if the Mormon people believed in having all things in common his answer was "No." (D. H. C.. Vol. III, p. 28) In order to understand the true spirit of the law of the United Order it must be understood that basically all that we are and have really belongs to the Lord. He, therefore, can call upon us for our property as well as our lives since both are his in the first place (Doc. And Cov. 104: 14-17, 47-57). The amount of a man's property which should be retained by the Church and the amount he should receive back was to be determined as follows, as presented by the Prophet in a letter dated June 25, 1833 and addressed to Edward Partridge: "I proceed to answer your questions, concerning the consecration of property:? First, it is not right to condescend to very great particulars in taking inventories. The fact is this, a man is bound by the law of the Church, to consecrate to the Bishop, before he can be considered a legal heir to the kingdom of Zion; and _ this, too, without constraint; and unless he does this, he cannot be acknowledged before the Lord on the Church books: therefore, to condescend to particulars, I will tell you that every man must be his own judge how much he should receive and how much he should suffer to remain in the hands of the Bishop. I speak of those who consecrate more than they need for the' support of themselves and their families. "The matter of consecration must be done by the mutual consent of both parties; for to give the Bishop power to say how much every man shall have, and he be obliged to comply with the Bishop's judgment, is giving to the Bishop more power than a king has; and upon the other hand, to let every man say how much he needs, and the Bishop be obliged to comply with his judgment, is to throw Zion into confusion, and make a slave of the Bishop. The fact is, there must be a balance or equilibrium of power between the Bishop and the people, and thus harmony and goodwill may be preserved among you. "Therefore, those persons consecrating property to the Bishop in Zion, and then receiving an inheritance back, must reasonably show to the Bishop that they need as much as they claim. But in case the two parties cannot come to a mutual agreement, the Bishop is to have nothing ~ to do about receiving such consecrations; and the case must be laid before a council of twelve High Priests, the Bishop not being one of the council, but he is to lay the case before them." (Doc. Hist. 364- 65)?President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. When the parties reached an agreement, then the bishop would deed in fee simple the property agreed upon to the Church member. This the member would own outright as private property. The part of the member's property which was not turned back to him after these transactions had been made then became the common property of the Church to be used for the support of the poor in the Church. If a whole community of saints would thus comply with the law of the United Order there would be a feeling of equality among them, for all having been fair at first declaring their earthly possessions, they might by the same token feel free to call upon the bishop's store in time of need. The bishop, in tum, would be in the best position to administer such a "residue" of property (Doc. And Cov. 42:34-36), since he and his community would know that all had complied legally with the law of the Lord. Thus each saint would LESSON DEPARTMENT have his "Portion" or "Inheritance" from the common pool of properties or land first deeded to the Churchy. It was within the very first years of the Church that the Lord commanded his saints to obey the law of the United Order. By February of 1831, a number of the new converts had assembled in and about Kirtland, Ohio. It was the will of the Lord to have the members of the Church in New York assemble in Ohio. There would of necessity need to be preparations made for these people. Accordingly, Bishop Partridge was instructed to assign them lands after their arrival. At this time, the law of consecration was set into effect. The head of each family after having turned in his property was, in turn, issued a certificate for his portion and inheritance in the Church. Trouble came soon after this law went into effect since not all group played fair, The members of the Church from Colesville, New York, on their arrival in Ohio, were located at a place called Thompson, about sixteen miles northwest of Kirtland. Here, as we have learned, they were directed to live according to the Lord's law, that is, the order of stewardship and consecration of properties. Among these people there resided a man named Leman Copley, who was a member of the 'Shaking Quakers' before he joined the Church. He owned a large tract of land which he agreed to turn over to the Colesville branch to occupy in this manner of stewardship, agreeable with the revelation they had received. It appears that Copley had not been fully converted to the Gospel and he, with some others, later rebelled and broke the covenant of consecration. This caused confusion among the Colesville saints and placed them at the mercy of their enemies, as well as in jeopardy before the Lord. In their distress they sent Knight, who was in charge of the branch at Thompson, to the Prophet to learn what they should do. The Lord spoke unto them saying that their covenant had been broken and therefore was of no effect, and it would have been better for the one who was responsible for the offense, 'had he been drowned in the depth of the sea.' The members of the branch were now commanded to journey to Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites,' and there they were to seek 'a living like unto men' until the Lord might prepare a place for them (Essentials in Church History, page 127).  The Stories of other attempts to live the law of United Order are not unlike this one as to the Outcome some d e the Saints at times succeeded, but as a group they seemed not ready to comply with the will of the Lord in these matters. Today, with so many schemes abroad as to the best solution for a perfect social order, we as members of the Church might well look into the Lord's words and learn his will as did the people of Enoch. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1 . "And all things shall be done by common consent in the Church . . ." (Doc. and Cov. 26:2). What does this mean? Note pages 178-179 following Sec. 26 in the Commentary. 2. Is a person disloyal to the government who acknowledges God as the supreme ruler? (Read Doc. and Cov. 58:21-22) For further class discussion or home study on the United Order read, "Private Ownership Under the United Order" by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Conference Address, October 1942; see also Improvement Era, November 1942.

Visiting Seachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 7?Charity Hopeth All Things, Charity Endureth All Things Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, April 2, 1946 Objective: To show that charity meets offense with patience, understanding, and hope. Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you,... Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven (Matt. 5:43-45). THIS is strong doctrine. Man seems to be more inclined by nature to give blow for blow than love for hate or good for evil. Critics and skeptics call this Christian ideal good for the kingdom of heaven, but not for this world. Still, we may ask, what does experience teach us? Not infrequently when a person is dealt with unfairly his first impulse is to fight for his rights, to rally the support of his friends, or even to return evil for evil in order to teach the offender the error of his ways. Experience reveals the folly of such a course of action, for argument only stirs more argument as the wind stirs the open fire; and evil not only increases evil, but justifies it in the mind of the first offender. A person of charity knows a better way to deal with an offense against him. Since "charity seeketh not her own," his first reaction to injury or criticism is not to engage in self-defense, but to look within himself to find the cause for the real or imagined offense. If, after making careful study and receiving wise counsel, he finds no cause within himself for the offense, then he is happy that the accusation against him is not justified. And since "'charity rejoiceth in the truth" he is willing to wait, to hope, and even to endure until truth can be his vindicator which it can be and will be far more effectively than he himself could ever be. Hardship and suffering make up a normal part of a person's life. The rains descend, the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon every life (See Matt. 7:24-27). Sometimes these things come upon us as
natural consequences of our own ignorance and sins; often they are 
the result of the ignorance and sins of others or of the natural conditions
of earth-life. Whatever their cause, they do not leave us untouched. One
who comes face-to-face with real struggle and suffering will never be
the same person again. Either he will increase in cynicism, bitterness,
melancholy or self-pity, or he will grow in humility, compassion, understanding,
and love. It isn't what happens to us, and more especially what is said about us, that matters, but our attitude towards these things and toward those who offend us. Charity is an unfailing source of strength which enables us to meet
life with courage and faith, with patience, understanding, and love. It
relieves its possessor of the burden of a wounded self and of the need
to waste energy in self-excuse and self-defense, in blame, or retaliation.
It frees the mind and heart for their larger task of knowing the truth and
loving the right. Charity does not mean submission to wrong and to
error; it means more strength for the right and for the truth. LESSON DEPARTMENT
Literature The Bible in our Literature Lesson 7-Bible Influence as Revealed in Sermons Essays, and Orations. Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, April 16, 1946 Added the treasured songs, stories, and Plays that have been created for our recreation, we have we have
a wealth of choice sermons, essays, and orations. As distinguished
from the lyric, epic, and dramatic types of literature, already presented
in these lessons, the sermon, essay, and oration are in a general sense
more didactic in purpose and spirit. They teach or portray facts and
truths of life with more directness. At times, this didactic type of literature
rises to classic heights. All Down the Stream of time men h Voiced their thoughts and feelings have voiced their thoughts and feelings have tried to do what they felt was
right. Often what was said rang with such force that it echoed and
re-echoed through the years. For illustration: We hold these truths to be Self-evident that all men are Created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ? Declaration oi Independence, Thomas Jefferson. 62 It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation, _ under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. ?Gettysburg Speech, Abraham Lincoln Only great occasions bring forth such soul-stirring expressions. When a nation is at a crisis, some leader usually rises to voice the heart of the people. When truth is soundly, aptly spoken, the words are caught up and passed on as maxims for guidance, as clarion calls to duty. Usually such expressions, as the ones above, are simple,. Direct, rhythmic, easy to remember. In word or spirit, they reveal Bible inspiration. In "times that try men's souls," those who bear the responsibility of leadership, almost unfailingly turn to Holy Writ for light and strength. During Britain's darkest days of World War II, when Winston Churchill could promise his people only "blood, sweat, toil and tears," he constantly held faith and courage before them in words such as these: The task which has been set us is not beyond our strength; its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our cause, and unconquerable will power, salvation will not be denied us. In the words of the Psalmist: "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." Later, when the clouds had lifted, he could look back through the dark days and say: All the world, even our best friends, thought that our end had come.... We were united in that solemn, majestic hour.... We faced our duty, and by the mercy of God we were preserved. Such bracing of men and women for their duties is by no means limited to times of deepest distress. In less degree it comes with everyday needs. All of us, great or small, are constantly saying things to try to help the world along. One thing that marks our daily talk is folk sayings that have come down as a homely heritage of wisdom. Everyone will recall some of these old, time-tested bits of advice that fell from the lips of grandmother, grandfather or parents, or some helpful-spirited neighbor. Here are just a few samples: Don't let the grass grow under your feet. Remember, a stitch in time saves nine. Honesty is the best policy. Handsome is as handsome does. Frequently a bit of wisdom came in verse, as: The Devil was sick?the Devil a monk would be; The Devil was well?the Devil a monk was he. ?Rabelais A goodly part of our didactic literature, indeed, is cast into verse form?this to make it easier to learn by heart. Songs sung in religious services are in large measure more didactic than lyric. A central purpose in their creation is to impress a gospel lesson. For illustration, take these typical lines: Count your many blessings Name them one by one; And it will surprise you What the Lord hath done. Let us oft speak kind words to each other, At home or where'er we may be. LESSON DEPARTMENT Poets, dramatists, novelists, frequently let life lessons flower forth in their creations. Oliver Wendell Holmes, for example, after pondering over a broken shell of a chambered. Nautilus, created a beautiful lyric on its life and growth, and closed with a message for himself and for all of us. Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, As the swift seasons roll! Leave thy low-vaulted past! Let each new temple, nobler than the last, Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, Till thou at length art free, Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea! Bryant's "To a Waterfowl," in which the poet pictures a bird winging its solitary way through the sky into the night, closes with these impressive lines: He who, from zone to zone, Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight, In the long way that I must tread alone, Will lead my steps aright. Life lessons such as these, which blossom naturally out of songs, stories or plays, are diamond truths in their settings. Our literature is sprinkled with like gems of thought ?made the more impressive because they are artistically presented. In harmony with all true teaching, they lead, guide, persuade, but do not "force the human mind." Preachers will do well to keep this basic principle, so marvelously exemplified in the life of the Master Teacher, constantly in mind. Our most effective ones do. Indirectly, rather than directly, they present 63 their lessons of life. As with the Savior, they often make the truth walk and talk through a well-told story. Occasionally when conditions demand, they speak with plainness, as did Jesus when he drove the money changers out of the temple, and when he rebuked the scribes and Pharisees. Generally, however, the approach to the hearts and minds is such that folk are stirred with the impulse not merely to be good but to do good. A few illustrations of what may be called persuasive preaching or teaching are the following: I sometimes think that we expect too much of Christmas Day. We try to crowd into it the long arrears of kindliness and humanity for the whole year. As for me, I like to take my Christmas a little at a time, all through the year. And thus I drift along into the holidays?let them overtake me unexpectedly?waking up some fine morning and suddenly saying to myself: "Why, this is Christmas Day." ?The Friendly Road, David Grayson It. Is hard for me to see how a great man can be an atheist. Without the sustaining influence of faith in a divine power we could have little faith in ourselves. We need to feel that behind us is intelligence and love. Doubters do not achieve; skeptics do not contribute; cynics do not create. Faith is the great motive power; and no man realizes his full possibilities unless he has the deep conviction that life is eternally important and that his work, well done, is a part of an unending plan. ?Fundamentals of a Successful Life, Calvin Coolidge. There is no real wealth in gold. People talk about being wealthy?about being rich; but place the richest banking company in the world upon a barren rock, with their gold piled around them, with no possible chance of exchanging it, and destitute of the creature comforts, and they would be poor indeed.... 64 Men and women who are trying to make themselves happy in the possession of wealth or power will miss it, for nothing short of the Gospel of the Son of God can make the inhabitants of the earth happy, and prepare them to enjoy heaven here and hereafter. Discourses of Brigham Young, pages 473-4, 483. Our national welfare should always be a theme deeply rooted in our minds and exemplified in our individual lives, and the desire for our nation's good should be stronger than political party adherence. The nation's welfare means the welfare of every one of its citizens. To be a worthy and a prosperous nation, it must possess those qualities which belong to individual virtues. The attitude of our country toward other nations should always be honest and above suspicion, and every good citizen should be jealous of our nation's reputation both at home and abroad. National patriotism is, therefore, something more than mere expression of willingness to fight, if need be. Gospel Doctrine, Joseph F. Smith, page 517. Latter-day Saints, of all people, should show excellence in didactic literature. Opportunity for such expression is abundantly afforded them. And they will grow in grace and power if they study and practice expressing uplifting thoughts that come to them?not in just commonplace style?but with sincerity, and simple artistry. As a practical suggestion: Appreciate the ideas God gives you by writing them in your own best language; also keep inspirational thoughts others express?a few strikingly effective ones that have impressed you. With such practice and appreciation, skill to write and to speak will grow in you. Thousands upon thousands of choice sermons, essays, orations have been created and will continue to be created down the years. Again, if time is not to be wasted on the mediocre, we must cultivate a sense of selection.. No two of us will choose the same; our backgrounds for appreciation differ; even our moods change. Yet, if there is to be an upbuilding of our lives, only that which promotes a love for the good, the beautiful, and the true will claim our time and attention. This does not mean that we shall choose only those selections which plainly are linked with the Bible in word or spirit. Much of our didactic literature, particularly of the essay type, is created largely to inform or entertain. Observe, for example, the following paragraph from one of John Burrough's nature sketches, The Apple: How they resist the cold! Holding out almost as long as the red cheeks of the boys do. A frost that destroys the potatoes and other roots only makes the apple more crisp and vigorous; they peep out from the chance November snows unscathed. When I see the fruit vendor on the street comer stamping his feet and beating his hands to keep them warm, and his naked apples lying exposed to the blasts, I wonder if they do not ache to clap their hands and enliven their circulation. But they can stand it nearly as long as the vendor can. No mention of the Bible in this apple sketch, yet it brings enjoyment and stirs good memories, as do all well-written and wholesome essays on nature. Literature that takes us out-of-doors, that opens our eyes to the wonder world around us, that lets us travel far and wide, even though we do not leave our firesides to do it?is always helpful, if it is clean and pure. We may get not only information, but interpretation of human folk and also some good fun from such reading. LESSON DEPARTMENT A classic book of travel that spreads a feast of geography, history, descriptions of nature and human nature for us, with bits of humor thrown in to spice the trip, is Mark Twain's Innocents Abroad. Most folk think of this great writer as merely a humorist. He is all that and more. Observe, for example, these soul-lifting lines from the book just named: Night is the time to see Galilee. ... Its history and its associations are its chiefest charm, in any eyes, and the spells they weave are feeble in the searching light of the sun. Then we scarcely feel the fetters. Our thoughts wander constantly to the practical things of life. . . . But when day is done, even the most unimpressionable must yield to the dreamy influences of this tranquil starlight. ... In the lapping of the waves upon the beach, he hears the dip of ghostly oars; in the secret noises of the night he hears spirit voices; in the soft sweep of the breeze, the rush of invisible wings. Phantom ships are on the sea, the dead of twenty centuries come forth from the tombs, and in the dirges of the night wind the songs of forgotten ages find utterance again. In the starlight, Galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the heavens, and is a theater meet for great events; meet for the birth of a religion able to save the world; and meet for the stately Figure appointed to stand upon its stage and pro-claim its high decrees. . . . One can com-prehend it only when night has hidden all incongruities and created a theater proper for so grand a drama. With his vivid word pictures, his humorous touches, his sharp shafts at the sham and show and mockeries that bring unholiness to sacred placess, the author takes us round the land of Palestine, and leaves us, as he does in the above paragraphs, with deeper appreciation of the inner meaning and significance of storied places round which we linger with him in that Holy Land. Another selection which brings us closer to the spirit of religion and to the heart of a great American, comes from a treasured book, presented to the writer by President Grant, Abra-ham Lincoln? Man oi God, by John Wesley Hill. In this volume, rich with incidents of Lincoln, is a story told by one of his boyhood friends. This friend, on invitation, had ac-companied Lincoln to the home of a woman who had but a few hours to live. She had requested that her will be made before she passed away. When this was done, she said to Lincoln, "Now I have my affairs in this world arranged satisfactorily. I have also made preparation for the life to come. I do not fear death. I am glad that I am soon to meet those who have gone before." ' T our faith in God is wise and strong," said Lincoln. "Your hope of a future life is blessed." She then asked him if he would not read a few verses from the Bible. They offered him the Book; he did not take it but began reciting from memory the Twenty- third Psalm. Then he quoted the first part of the fourteenth chapter of John, 'In my Father?s house are many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you.? After he had given these and other quotations from the scriptures, he recited several hymns, closing with "Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me." "A little while after the woman passed to her reward," said the friend. "As we rode home in the buggy, I expressed surprise that he should have acted as pastor as well as attorney so perfectly, and Lincoln replied, 'God and eternity were very near me today.'

Social Science Modern Applications of Moral Principles Lesson 13?Some Broader Applications of Social Ethics Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, April 23, 1946 Lesson link: Moral aspects of courtship, marriage, widowhood, and other phases of family life were analyzed last time. It was shown that family stability is necessary to the building and maintaining of morals, and that morality in turn is fundamental to family stability. Selfishness was regarded as the major reason for family breakdown, the primary source of immorality in marriage; and, in contrast, love, co-operation, and helpfulness were named as the essence of family ethics. Lesson aim: To examine some of the inequalities and inhumanities existent in the world today, and to show that justice, when not violated, leads to both peace and happiness. LESSON DEPARTMENT LOOKING back over previous lessons, and remembering particularly the brotherhood principle, we can see that morality is offended whenever justice is violated. Advancements and satisfactions based upon self-interest alone are not enough when it comes to ethics; self-righteousness is no righteousness at all. Real morality is based upon love, equality, fraternity, and justice.
Need and Greed
In 1933, the middle of the great depression, America had between twelve and seventeen million workers unemployed. Several million are unemployed regularly, even in normal years. Furthermore, income varies greatly among those who are able to find work, as shown by the fact that in the 1935-36 period nearly half of America's families received yearly incomes of less than $1,000 each and the 195,000 highest income families received as much as the 13,000,000 families with lowest income. It was President Franklin D. Roosevelt who said that at least one-third of our families are "ill-housed, ill-clothed, ill-fed." During depression years the percentage of poverty goes even lower than that. In America, "the land of opportunity," the land favored with an abundance of natural resources as in no other spot on the earth, poverty and pauperism exist side by side with surplus and waste, people starve in the midst of plenty.
Greed is the explanation for much of the need in the world today. Our great maldistribution of wealth, which permits all of this suffering, is not to be explained on the basis of power and privilege more than ability and effort. It is true, of course, that individuals differ in capacities and abilities as well as in application and effort, so that it is utterly impossible to imagine any individual or level economic equality over a long stretch of time; wealth will quite naturally gravitate to those with ability and industry, and to some extent it should. Even so, any real justice tempered with Christian mercy would require that no one be permitted to go without the necessities of life; the "haves" should feel a responsibility for the "have nots." But more serious even than the widespread tendency on the part of the fortunate to refuse charities and ignore the handicapped, is the fact that economic fortune is so often related to luck, privilege, and a willingness to cheat. While we cannot expect equality so far as ability and industry are concerned, we do not even have an equality of opportunity. Wealth depends too much upon special advantage and deceit, not enough upon effort and honesty.
The profit motive in business, industry, labor groups, and some professions is apparently amoral in its nature, for it takes little heed of ethics or public welfare; expediency is the thing; profit is placed above principle. Advertising all too frequently overplays the qualities of the product in order to sell for profit. Merchandising has likewise in too many instances become a game of deceiving and tricking the public; note the technique of high-pressure salesmanship, for example; and the practice of making goods in order to mark them down again for a "sale"; and the tendency to reduce the quality of goods, jump price ceilings, and in other ways profiteer in wartime. Many big-time industrialists are still ready and willing to exploit the laborer and cheat the consumer in order to build up power and accumulate huge profits. And organized labor, on the other hand, has frequently resorted to work slowdowns, wage holdups, and other questionable devices; in its legitimate struggle for equality, labor has frequently gone rabid and extreme; its cry for justice has too often become a demand for power and special privilege. Professional ethics is probably more highly developed than business, industrial, or labor ethics, but even here is the frequent spirit of money madness. Unless the profit motive can somehow or other be tempered or oriented in the direction of social welfare in all fields of economic activity, justice will never be reached and morality will remain a thing talked about but seldom practiced.
Latter-day Saints should be appreciative of the Church Welfare Program, for its aim is that of security through both self-effort and brotherly love. Emphasis is upon helping people to help themselves rather than encouraging them to accept something for nothing. This is a high moral principle. Personal effort and individual responsibility are of primary concern, as they must always be in any true moral system. But also in the plan is the idea that mercy must go beyond mere justice; greed give way to brotherhood, and the actual needs of people be met by the individual himself if he is able to work, next by his family, and finally by the Church. By sustaining the dignity of labor this program avoids pauperization. By insisting upon moral responsibility toward both self and neighbors it builds character. Fundamentally it is a program of security through industry and mutual aid in the spirit of Christ.
Racketeering
Defined broadly, racketeering simply means to obtain money by fraud, swindle, or other immoral procedures. Sometimes it is outside the law, but often, too, it is technically within the law though beyond all bounds of ethics. The essential idea in racketeering is the circumvention of law for the sake of big money; it is the idea of extortion, or taking money with trickery or force without earning it. The law is evaded sometimes by direct defiance, as in the case of the so-called criminal; sometimes by hiring clever lawyers to find legal loopholes and technical escape valves; and sometimes by bribing public officials for the sake of protection. But always in racketeering there is the spirit of getting something for nothing; the idea that "only the foolish work."
Following are some of the leading types of rackets: (1) Organized robbery, burglary, and larceny. This is usually carried on by criminal gangs and is, of course, in defiance of the law. (2) Dishonest business dealings such as misrepresenting funds, "watering" stock, profiteering on war contracts, promoting fake enterprises, managing banks, stock exchanges, or corporations fraudulent in kind and other varieties. LESSON DEPARTMENT (3) Organized racketeering of industries. Sometimes this is spoken of as "gangster" control, actually, although this kind of criminal more often escapes the hand of the law, white-collar crime cheats the public out of far more money each year than do the more obvious types of stealing. (3) Kidnapping. This extremely depraved form of racket flourished here some ten or fifteen years ago but the Lindbergh law, which prescribes the death penalty for kidnappers, and the activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have practically put an end to it. (4) Bootlegging and the black market. During the prohibition era bootlegging became so prevalent as to constitute a national scandal, and during World War II the black market has expanded to similar proportions. In both cases millions of people have shown themselves willing to take advantage of an artificial legal scarcity and to run against the law for the sake of personal profit. (5) Professional gambling. By playing upon people's willingness to take a chance in order to "get rich quick," and resorting to underhanded trickery, professional gamblers are able to take millions of dollars away from the American public each year. In some areas this is legal, but in most places where gambling establishments operate they do so outside the law. (6) Tribute for "protection." Organized gangs, in the larger cities particularly where they often have an "understanding" with the political machine in power, sometimes extort large sums of money from the various business establishments on the farce of "protection." Unless each establishment hands over to these gangsters the requested sum, it will find its buildings wrecked with a bomb, its goods destroyed with acid, or some other mysterious disaster happening to it?and knowing this, the 69 establishment usually ? comes through. This is one of the most vicious types of racketeering. (7) Betrayal of public office. Where public officials accept bribes, let contracts at inflated figures with the understanding that they will get a "cut" from the contractor, sell their own goods to the government at padded values, or in any other way use their office dishonestly for personal profit, they are betraying the public and deserting all claim to morality. Political Corruption But this is exactly what is happening in so many cases-Organized crime and racketeering, discussed above; would have a difficult time surviving if it were not for the "big fix" where unscrupulous politicians agree to protect criminals, of both the overall and white-collar varieties, in return for votes and money. Political machines are closely organized party organizations that are primarily interested in votes and power regardless of how these are obtained. Party "bosses" with numerous henchmen under them administer their machines in an arbitrary, dictatorial manner. Votes are bought with money and_ personal favors; public jobs are handed out to supporters of the machine regardless of qualifications, and sometimes even jobs, which carry large compensations but little or no work, are created on the books for "faithful" party members; occasionally there is illegal control at the polls and a miscounting of votes. Machine politics is corrupt at its very core for it caters to vested interests, to pressure groups, and not to the will of the people. Corrupt politics is not confined to ~~ any one political party. Blind bigoted party loyalty, with little concern for the issues or the personalities involved, is as un-democratic as it is un-American; and yet we have and have had much of it. Narrow expediency in party politics, at the sacrifice of principle, is as un-Christian as it is immoral; and yet it abounds on every hand., As said in an earlier lesson, what we need is 'more statesmen and fewer politicians?more who are courageous enough to put justice and public welfare before private profit, and fewer who are willing to fleece the public for their own good. Since much of the inefficiency and corruption that is permitted to exist in government circles is there because of an uninformed and indifferent voting public, it follows that the only solution is an enlightened and aroused citizenry. War and Peace The periodic continuation of war throughout the ages, and the tendency for modern wars to be even more total in their brutality and their destructive tendencies than earlier ones is a pretty sad reflection upon the moral progress of mankind. War is basically immoral for it leads to suffering and sorrow rather than peace and happiness. And yet war persists and grows in intensity. But though war is an evil of considerable magnitude, it is not the greatest evil in the world today. Peace is highly desirable, but peace at any price is indefensible and inconceivable. The greatest evil of mankind is injustice, and until this can be eliminated wars will be inevitable and, to some extent, justifiable. There is no point in appeasing the perpetuators of wrong and Oppression; any compromise with error and evil is unthinkable. As wrong as war is, if it is a war for justice, truth, and righteousness it has some justification. (For a justification of killing for righteous purposes see 1 Nephi, chap. 4.) Permanent peace, the goal of mankind and the capstone of moral progress, can hardly be realized without the establishment first of all of equality and justice. Unless democracy and Christianity can be felt internally and lived nationally, there 'is little hope for any world-wide or universal application of these principles. Until we are wise enough and big enough to clean up our own house there is little chance that we will ever be able to help much in the building of a better world. Real happiness, then, can never come without peace, nor peace without justice, justice without brotherhood. The key to peace and happiness in this life, or the life to come, is and will always be love, equality, and justice. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Cite figures to show the great maldistribution of wealth in this country. Are all men equal in ability, in industry or effort, in opportunity? Give reasons for your answers. How do inequalities in ability, effort, and opportunity explain the inequalities in wealth? Which of these do you think are justified? Show how the profit motive often operates in defiance of ethics, Give illustrations from the various fields of economic activity, and discuss each. Why does justice require a more equable distribution of wealth and a further development of social security? Discuss aspects of this. Why does the elimination of need depend upon the elimination of greed? 2. Define racketeering.  LESSON DEPARTMENT How or why is it permitted to exist? Discuss each of the seven types of racketeering listed in the lesson, and give original examples for each type. 3. Why is blind party loyalty un-American? Why is expediency in party politics immoral? To what extent is the voting public responsible for corrupt politics? Can the problem be solved? How? 4. Why is moder war a reflection on moral progress?
