Suggestions to Contributors We reserve the right to edit all accepted manuscripts according to the needs of the Magazine. Where the changes are slight, the contributor will not be contacted regarding them. However, where more important changes may be necessary, the author will be consulted whenever this is possible. We do not solicit reprints and we publish material of this type only by special arrangements. Therefore, do not send us material of any kind which has been published or is in the hands of a publisher. Payments are made on publication and, due to overstocked files, no promises can be made as to when accepted manuscripts will be published. If an author wishes to have a manuscript, which has been accepted and is being held for publication, returned, he should request this to be done and enclose postage for return of the manuscript. Seasonal material should reach us four to six months prior to publication date. We cannot offer detailed criticism of rejected manuscripts. 2. PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS a. WE. Manuscripts should be typed (double-spaced) on one side only of regulation 8 1/2"x11" paper. Authors are asked to retain carbon copies of all manuscripts submitted to TheFor submitting manuscripts it is convenient for authors to use envelopes of two sizes, the larger envelope for the outgoing manuscript and the smaller envelope, bearing the writer's name and address, for return in case the manuscript is not accepted. Envelopes designated in the stationer's trade as No. 8 and No. 9g are suitable for poems and short manuscripts. For stories and longer articles 6"x9" and 6 1/2?x9 1/2" envelopes may be used.. Adequate postage should be provided for both outgoing and return envelopes. Manuscripts, which must always be sent first class, require (for the United States, Canada, and Mexico) three cents for each ounce or fraction thereof.. Correct spelling, paragraphing, and punctuation are definite aids in the acceptance of a manuscript. All factual material should be carefully checked for accuracy. Page 42 3. CURRENT NEEDS a. Stories, preferably short stories between 1500 and 3,000 words. Serials of eight to ten chapters of about 2,000 words each. For serials, submit at first only chapters one and two and an outline of the remainder. B. Articles, from 500 to 1500 words. Material should follow a definite outline with an interesting beginning and a logical sequence. C. Poetry, of definite pattern in stanza, form, and meter. Since many of our poems are used as fillers, we can more readily accept short poems (4-12 lines) than longer contributions. The use of archaic words, inversions, and contractions should be avoided. D. Photographs, glossy black and white, size 8"x10", suitable for cover or frontispiece.
