Prize-Winning Story Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest First Prize Story Spring Festival Mary Ek Knowles IT was Josef Straubel's fiftieth birthday, but he had forgotten all about that. As he stood on the corner of Main and Second Street waiting for his bus, his mind was troubled with last minute anxieties concerning the Spring Festival which was to be presented at eight o'clock that evening. Again he went over the program, his head moving slowly from side to side like a metronome as mentally he checked off each act. The kindergarten class? A Spring Flower Garden . . . first grade? Presenting Robin Red Breast . . . second grade . . . and so on down the program to seventh grade? Violin Solo? Mendelssohn's "Spring Song"? Greta Johanson. The program must be a success! Mr. Jessop and Mr. Bard of the school board were going to be there. Maybe if they saw how hard everyone had worked to make the Festival a success despite the handicap of only an antiquated gymnasium in which to present the program, they would see that Lincoln School got an auditorium. Doubts chilled Josef. The red velvet curtains donated by Mrs. O'Toole were very heavy. Would the wire stretched across one end of the gym hold! The spotlight? pray that Benny Lee controlled the imp in him, and kept it trained on the stage. Would the audience grow tired sitting on the backless benches? What if the fifth grade a cappella choir sang off key. And Greta Johanson? could he depend on her or would the weakness he had detected in h er character betray them at the last moment! 14 So Josef worried, and then suddenly a warm breeze caressed his cheek, and, rising above the confusion of the busy street, the smell of oil and gasoline, there was the scent of hyacinths. A crowded bus parked at the curb whizzed away and for a moment Josef's view was unobstructed. Across the street was the public square, like a painting done in water colors, hyacinths, lacy maple trees, a flowering almond bush, a golden forsythia, bright as sunshine. Josef breathed deep and his blood tingled. It was spring again. The opening bars of "Spring Song'? pianissimo, and with much expression?danced through his brain. One hand fell to his side, his fingers drummed out the notes on his trouser leg. In that moment Josef felt that the Festival would be a success. Lincoln School would get its auditorium. His heart was singing the "Spring Song" now, his fingers moving rapidly, crescendo, fortissimo... A shiny black car drove up to the curb and blotted out spring. A tall, heavy-set man got out. He slammed the car door, and gave clipped orders to his chauffeur. Then he turned. Josef saw his face, and his memory fumbled around like fingers searching for the right key on the piano. There was something familiar about the thin-lipped mouth, the square jaw. The man pushed his way through the crowd like a football player carrying the ball. Josef's memory found the right key, and the note was clear and true. Henry Biglow! Forward on the Camden University team, class of 1914! "Henry!" Josef called. "Henry Biglow!" The man stopped and looked back. Josef hurried forward, smiling. "Henry, you old culprit! Are you?" Henry Biglow frowned down at Josef, ignoring the outstretched hand. Then, slowly, recognition dawned, and he started to laugh, softly at first, then a roaring laugh so that people turned and stared. "Josef Straubel! What are you doing in Sanford?" "Tm teaching music at Lincoln School." "In the slums! Why, the last time I saw you, you were all set with a scholarship at Boston Conservatory of Music. What happened?" OSEF did not answer. He remembered the scholarship, and how young and eager he had been, and the memory was like the sweet strains of some forgotten melody. How to tell Henry Biglow that an undersized kid in a ragged, striped jersey had changed his plans. A skinny kid saying, "Mr. Straubel, you ain't goin' away, are yu?" "Still the idealist, aren't you?" Henry's laugh cut deep, and his small black eyes missed nothing. He took his hand out of his pocket, and Josef saw the diamond on his little finger sparkle. 'Well, I'm still the hardheaded realist. Get what I mean? Bye!" Still laughing, he pushed his way through the crowd. Yes, Josef "got" what his former classmate had meant. "You be an idealist," Henry used to say in those college days. "I'll be a realist, and we'll see who comes out on top." Josef winced as he remembered the scorn in Biglow's voice. Somehow he had never thought of his life in terms of failure or success. SPRING FESTIVAL Time had passed so rapidly, days into weeks, weeks into months, and suddenly there were years, thirty of them. He remembered then that today was his birthday and he was fifty years old. He saw his reflection in the plate glass of the hotel door. It was not reassuring. He saw a short fat man in a shabby black suit, the jacket of which was stretched almost to the breaking point so that the top button could be buttoned. A gray felt hat of ancient vintage was perched atop his head. Under his left arm he carried a portfolio full to bursting. His right hand toyed with a fraternity pin dangling from the watch chain looped across his vest. He heard someone say, "There's the Willowcreek bus now!" He remembered the Spring Festival and that if he missed this bus he would have to wait a half hour for another. He ran for the bus. Josef Straubel lived at No. 7 Gunnel Court. The advertisement had described the house as within easy walking distance of town, furnished. Josef, the graduate, had found the rent cheap, the house a two-room frame, small, but with a bit of rearranging, large enough for his baby grand piano, his books and his music. Plenty good enough to live in for the short time until he went to Boston. He had paid a month's rent in advance. He had stayed thirty years. The light was on, and when Josef opened the door and walked into the small crowded front room, Mrs. Hennessey, his landlady, came out of the tiny kitchen, a spoon in her hand, a starched percale apron covering her ample form. "Hope you don't mind my just barging in like this," she said, "with you gone and all. But it was getting late, and I knew you'd be rushed, what with your big program and all, so I come over and brought you a bit of stew and a piece of rhubarb "That was very kind of you!" Warmth for Mrs. Hennessey with her friendly manner, and her gray hair crimped about her big face, filled him. He had a sudden impulse to tell Mrs. Hennessey what Henry Bigelow had said. After all he had known her for thirty years. He would tell her 'a she would say, "Well, the high and mighty, who does he think he is, anyhow!" And they would laugh, and the feeling that swept over him like nausea every time he remembered what Henry had said would go away. He opened his mouth to speak, then shut it again. He just wanted to forget the whole thing. He laid his portfolio on the grand piano, tossed his hat on a chair. "Come, eat up, now," Mrs. Hennessey said as she walked back into the kitchen. "Get the food while it's hot!" JOSEF saw that Mrs. Hennessey had straightened the lean-to kitchen, washed the breakfast dishes and set the narrow table. He went to the sink, ran water into the enamel basin, and washed his hands and face. "I ironed your shirt, but I told Pa, 'Hennessey,' I said, 'how much longer Mr. Straubel thinks this shirt'll last I don't know.? Had to patch it again on the elbow. And your suit! It's that shiny in the seat!" Through the mirror Josef saw her 16 stand with hands on her broad hips. "Grew Brothers are havin' a sale this week. Good white shirts $1.97 and suits $25.89. Whyn't you let me buy you some clothes? You only have to pay five down and five a month." Josef suppressed a groan. Money, money! Somehow he never had enough to go around. This month he'd be lucky if he had enough left over to pay his rent and buy food. There was the bill at Kendall Music Company, the last payment on the loan at Friendly Credit. He smiled ruefully at himself in the mirror and the lines at the corners of his mouth deepened. "I?ll have to do that, Mrs. Hennessey. One of these days I'll have to do that." "And where have I heard that before!" Mrs. Hennessey threw a jacket around her shoulders, and her face was red. "It's just about time, Josef Straubel, that you started thinkin' of yourself for a change. So all-fired generous with them students of yourn. And do they appreciate it! Mark my words, someday you'll be sorry you was such a soft touch!" "Next month, Mrs. Hennessey. Next month I'm going to outfit myself like a dude. You'll see!" "W ell?we'll just see." Mrs. Hennessey hesitated, her hand on the front doorknob, her voice gentler. "Hope your program goes off all right, and you get your auditorium." "Thank you, Mrs. Hennessey." Left alone, Josef stood in the center of the room and looked around him. The room seemed to have shrunk in size. The piano took almost half the space. Everywhere were books, filling the three-shelf bookcase, piled on top, stacked on the floor in the corner. Music was piled on the piano?music for operettas, choruses, a half-completed Christmas cantata. Photographs of former students were hung on the wall above the piano. Somewhere among the clutter was a letter informing Josef Straubel that he had won a scholarship. He had placed it there that spring day long ago. He had come home from school with Eddie Thompson's words ringing in his ears, he had thought, I'll stay on at Lincoln just long enough to help straighten Eddie out. Thirty years, he thought, and this is all I have. This and a pile of debts, a worn suit and a patched shirt. It was so still that the ticking of the clock on the wall sounded loud. He remembered the Spring Festival. If only Lincoln got its auditorium, then it would be as if the days and weeks and months of that thirty years were blended into a triumphant song. WHEN he reached Lincoln School, the lights were on, and cars were parked on both sides of the street for blocks. All the fears came back, and he hurried through the side door, down the long hall that smelled of chalk and that oil peculiarly' like citronella. He opened the door of room one. Paperclad children rushed to him. "Here's Mr. Straubel now!" Miss Deal smiled toothily. "They were afraid you might muss the bus!" Josef saw Robin Red Breast, the members of the a cappella choir, the flower garden... But no Greta Johanson. "Where's Greta?" he asked. SPRING FESTIVAL Miss Deal looked worried. "I haven't seen her. It's getting late, too!" He went to look for her, the apprehension within him deepening. He couldn't depend on her, then. All these months had been for nothing! I he passed the music room, a voice called to him. "Oh, here you are Greta!"' Relief swept over him. Greta held her violin tight in her hands. "Mr. Straubel, I'm scared. All those people out there, all those faces watching me. What if I forget the music, what if I play off key!" So it was only stage fright. Josef looked at Greta's broad, pale face, saw the fear in her blue eyes. He saw, too, the new blue taffeta dress, obviously homemade, yet covering so proudly the tall lanky body. He took her hand in his. It was like ice. "Greta," he said kindly, "listen to me. I know what you can do. I know that you are going to forget everything but your violin and the song you want it to play. You're going to be a big success, Greta." She looked at him for a long moment, and seemed to draw strength from his words. She smiled. "I'll try awful hard, Mr. Straubel." The small gym was so crowded that people were sitting in the windows, standing in doorways. He saw Mr. Jessop and Mr. Bard sitting on chairs right in front. Mr. Jessop looked over the crowd, then bent and whispered to Mr. Bard. This should convince them we need an auditorium, Josef thought. He stood before the orchestra and raised his baton. He led them through the overture, held his breath 17 as two brown elves pulled back the red velvet drapes. But the wire held firm, and for the next hour and a half Josef forgot himself, he forgot Henry Biglow. The show was going over. One by one the acts came on, did their parts, bowed their way out to enthusiastic applause. And soon it was the last act. Greta Johanson stood before them, and as she played, Josef listened with the critical ear of a musician, He heard clear tone, a sureness of touch. But there was something else, too, an emotion that was Greta's own, that something that no teacher, no matter how excellent, could give her. He looked at Greta. There was something regal about the lanky figure in the cheap dress. He remembered Greta as she was that day two years ago when he kept her after class. "Don't you like music, Greta?" Her defiant attitude during class had been very noticeable. "Music!" she sneered. Her childish face was thick with make-up, her hair a tangled mop, her clothes too tight, too short on her tall body. Jors= had said nothing, but sometimes when the orchestra was playing, he had seen a look in Greta's eyes. He once took his violin from the top of the piano and played a few bars of Schubert's "Serenade." Greta was at his side. "That's what I wanna do," she choked. "Play the violin!" "Then why don't you?" "You kiddin'?" Her eyes filled with tears. "My old man ain't got enough money to feed us, let alone buy me a violin." "I have an inexpensive violin I could let you borrow, and I could give you the first lessons." Josef came back to the present as "The Spring Song" ended with two perfectly blended chords played softly. Since then there had been times when Greta had been unpredictable, unstable, but now he knew suddenly that she was going to be all right. There was a moment's hushed silence, then the audience burst into thunderous applause. Josef arose, satisfaction for a job well done filling him. Lincoln would get its auditorium. He turned to see Mr. Jessop and Mr. Bard walking out the side door. People were filing out without so much as a backward glance. In a surprisingly short time, the crowd was gone, and Josef was alone standing by the piano, his hand outstretched. He sank down weakly on the piano stool. He had been mistaken, then, and the program hadn't been a success. Even in this he was a failure. Disappointment was like a heavy stone crushing him. "Mr. Straubel, please!" Josef turned. A woman stood beside him. A red kerchief was tied over her head, a shabby black coat was draped on her tall form. Her work-worn hands were clasped tight before her. "Oh?hello, Mrs. Johanson." She spoke with a thick accent. "Mr. Straubel. I come to thank you. Tonight I sit there, I listen my Greta play, I think, so is she now, sweet and good, playing like a musician on the radio, yet. But so it was not always. How many nights I wait up, not knowing where is Greta?" "Greta was never bad, Mrs. Johanson," Josef defended. "It was just that she had this restlessness, this?all she needed was to have that great energy directed into the right channels." "Yah, I know! But nobody knew how to doit. Nobody but you?" "I just loaned her my violin?" "Nah! You not have one to loan. You buy her one." "Such an inexpensive one!" "You not foolin' me. Professor Lanz, he say it a good one.. Yah, I know. To everyone else Professor Lanz is three dollars, to mine Greta fifty cents." Tears were running down her lined face. Embarrassed, Josef looked away from her. "Someday we pay you back, Mr. Straubel. But now?all I can give you is a mother's blessin'. God bless you, Mr. Straubel!" She turned and hurried out of the gymnasium. Josef Straubel stared in the direction in which she had gone. It was true, of course. For eighteen months he had been paying for her lessons. From the first he had known Greta had unusual talent. How could he see it go to waste? Since that day when little Eddie looked up at him so pleadingly, he had not been able to turn a gifted child away. He had never tried to put the thought into words before, but now it came to him that the soul of a wayward child was like music played in discord, but if the melody could be found, then it would be like a symphony. He thought of the different students he had known. "Incorrigibles," he had heard them called. Never had he failed to reach them through music. Bob Ginsburg?the cornet had appealed to him. Marie Serpentine?the accordion for her. Sammy Lewis... Mose Washington. SPRING FESTIVAL Mose had been a puzzler until Josef saw the look on his ebony face when the drummer went through his tricks. The money it had cost him, he had not missed. A few minutes later he was walking home through the spring night. "Josef Straubel," he told himself, "Henry Biglow was right. You're fifty years old, and a failure." But he didn't care. He knew that if he had his life to live over, he would do just as he had done. He was sorry about the auditorium, but somehow they'd manage. He knew the quiet peace of a man who has found his destiny. It was late when he reached the small house. He turned the key in 19 the lock, opened the door. Lights flashed on, the night rang with cries of, "Happy Birthday!" Josef stood quite still, his hand on the doorknob. He saw the faces of students, teachers, the smiling face of Mrs. Hennessey. On the kitchen table was a birthday cake, and gifts stacked high. Mr. Jessop and Mr. Bard came toward him smiling, and he knew that Lincoln School would get its auditorium. In that moment he would not have traded places with all the Henry Biglows in the world. The little house was full, so full that it seemed the walls would burst, yet even so, not so full as Josef Straubel's heart. Mary Ek Knowles of Ogden, Utah, is the wife of Roland C.

Even the deaf feel vibrations. Some people have their feelings for music pent up in them, are musically tongue-tied, unable to produce a sound in key. Some people, when in the country, may not be aware that birds are singing, may not feel the romantic influence of music, and yet may have music within them needing only an awakening ?Anonymous. Nicholas G. Smith?A Tribute Elder Marion G. Romney Assistant to the Council of the Twelve N all my memory pictures of Nicholas G. Smith, there stands at his side Florence Gay Smith, his life's companion. They exemplified the Master's teaching, "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh" (Matt. 19:5-6). From Salt Lake City to South Africa, from Southern California to the Northwest and Alaska, at home and abroad, their lives ran together in an undivided current. Under their guidance, there developed in their home an unusually fine relationship between themselves as parents and their four sons. Rarely do parents enjoy the unrestrained confidence of their children as did they. Nicholas shared with his wife and family the fullness of his rich life, and judged in the light of eternity, his life was rich indeed. All but eight of his adult years he spent filling some major assignment in his Master's service. Often he had more than one such assignment at a time. Between thirteen and fourteen years he spent in the mission field; eighteen months as a high councilman; twelve and one-half years on the General Board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association; twelve years as bishop of the Seventeenth Ward; three years as Acting Patriarch to the Church; three years in the presidency of the Salt Lake Temple; and four and one-half years Page 20 NICHOLAS G. SMITH as an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles. As I think of this service, the 37th verse of the 13th chapter of First Nephi comes to my mind: And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, (when the Book of Mormon should come forth) for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost: and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be. NICHOLAS G. SMITH?A TRIBUTE The strength of his youth and the wisdom of his maturity he freely gave in publishing peace and declaring tidings of great joy. The whole purpose of his life was to assist in _ bringing forth Zion. And he endured to the end, which is the condition upon which the blessings of eternal life and exaltation are predicated. 21 Surely he was of the blessed who are described as being "beautiful upon the mountains." He and his family had before his passing, and his family now has, a sure hope that he shall be lifted up at the last day.
