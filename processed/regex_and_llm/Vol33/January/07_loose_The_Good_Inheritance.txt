BS Page 6 Prize- (inning (Poems Eliza Roxey Snow Memorial Prize Poem Contest EVA WILLES WANGSGAARD First Prize Poem Star of Gold Eva Willes Wangsgaard 1 ? My neighbor's Where last year window frames a golden stat hung its counterpart in blue, A sharp reminder of one gone too fat To walk again the friendly street he knew. Long weeks ago his mother hung it there And still the dusk of grief is in her eyes And loneliness impossible to share Ox mitigate by kneeling where he lies. She neither dwells upon him nor evades The mention of his name when others ask; Though memory wounds each day with deeper blades, She goes with normal mien from task to task. At what a cost her courage has been won! I've seen her hang her pillow in the sun. Page  II ? This star is many sons in one to her: A gurgling baby showing his first tooth, A tear-stained youngster pleading for a cur, A proud boy scout, a gangling, earnest youth. She knew his untried strength, his zest for life, Ideals he thought worth fighting to uphold, The girl he loved and hoped to make his wife And sharp cessation in this star of gold. To me, it is a symbol of the loss Of myriads of men who went beyond The lonely foxhole to the small white cross In Libyan sands or brushed by tropic frond. Oh, modern wise men, kneel in reverence Before this star and offer recompense! III ? The roaring wings that tore the world apart And made a mockery of miles and weather Can fly the lanes of peace and make a start Toward landing fields where all men walk together As neighbors should. Then, though he lies in sands Long burned by suns, or under shaggy palm Or chestnut tree or where the linden stands, His timeless sleeping shall be sound and calm. There was another star, another cross, Another wound that grew a rose as red; They hold the answer to my neighbor's loss. This star can lead us as the other led The shepherd's feet. Though high the goal and far, Can we deny the beckoning of a star?

CAROLINE EYRING MINER Third Prize Poem She Good Inheritance Caroline Eyring Miner I ? Earth All this is mine: the warm and fertile earth That yearns to yield her body to the seed Of purpling grape, of grain, of flower; the speed Of swallow darting through the dusk to find His mate; the miracle of human birth; The beauty of the changing sky; the need Of sun and rain for growth; the slender reed That trails the stream and sways against the wind And echoes back all songs the world has known; The hour when the sun has set, and light Along the mountains frames one Star alone; The heat of summer and the shade's delight. All this, the earth, the sea, the sky, in mood Both gay and sad, God gave, and called it good. II ? Democracy The love of man for man is at the core Of all; it is the song upon the lips; The anguished cry that mothers give, that more tom heart than voice emerges, and so grips Was blessed for use of common man; a low, But certain call in England's monarchy, ? glorious anthem of democracy. III ? Religious Freedom Almost a century ago they came, Brave fighting hearts, wending their weary way is the quiet peace the warbler knows That sits atop the tallest branch to Test, Surveying berry patch and garden rows And the unfathomed teaches of the sky, with mystery and wonder in his eye. Accuracy of expression.
