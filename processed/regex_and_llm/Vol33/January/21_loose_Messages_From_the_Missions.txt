MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS New England Mission MYRTLE BERNARDS, auxiliary supervisor of the New England Mission, reports: "In October of 1944 the Relief Society in the Providence Branch was discontinued because of the lack of members. Three families had moved to Salt Lake City and one to Mississippi. Since the first of the year, however, membership in the branch increased by the baptism of converts and other members moving in. The Relief Society was reopened in March with Sister Alice Lyon as president. One of the rooms in the branch chapel wasn't being used so the new Relief Society made their first project the redecorating of this room for their own use.. "The priesthood members replastered the walls and the Relief Society carried on from there. They had the floors covered with a dark green linoleum, painted the walls and woodwork and made curtains and drapes for the windows. The Providence chapel at one time had been used as a theater and the stage curtains had been left. These curtains were made up into drapes for all the windows in the chapel. This first project has been completed and the members of the Relief Society now have a lovely place to meet in Page 50 and carry on their regular outlined work. The priesthood members of the branch have recently completed a baptismal font and are now beautifying the grounds. On work nights the Relief Society sisters cook dinner at the chapel so the brethren may come right from their work, have dinner, and work outside around the chapel while it is still light. The Relief Society of this branch has greatly helped to increase activity and unity." Eastern States Mission ALBERTA O. DOXEY, president of the Eastern States Mission Relief Society, reports: "I have been able to visit a few of the branches of the mission and on these occasions I have found the sisters laboring under great difficulties due to scattered membership and scarcity of gasoline to reach meeting places but carrying on just the same, and their devotion to duty and accomplishments has indeed been inspiring. Many of our members are actively participating in some war service along with their Relief Society work and we have one member, a widow and officer in the Princeton Branch Relief Society, who has just donated her ninth pint of blood to the American Red Cross. BUFFALO BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY, EASTERN STATES MISSION, CHRISTMAS TOY DISPLAY Photograph submitted by Alberta O. Doxey, President Eastern States Mission Relief Society 52 Some notable accomplishments of some of our branches follow: "The small branch Relief Society at Newburgh, New York, with five active members, sponsored a bazaar on April 14, 1944, which netted a clear profit of $80.75 through the sale of refreshments and many beautiful articles made by the hands of these few sisters. "On August 24, the Altoona Branch Relief Society, with a total of seven active members, held a rummage sale which made a net profit of $61.49. All of the goods sold was donated by members and it was felt that the sale was a success in view of the amount made and the fact that only two months preparation was given to it. "The Buffalo Branch Relief Society had a notable project in September. It was decided that because of the scarcity and poor quality of toys that would be available, the branch Relief Society would make Christmas toys. As a result of many hours of work, quite a collection of adorable stuffed animals, some attractive bean bags, rag dolls, and the beginnings of drums, sets of blocks, costume jewelry for the older girls, scrap books, and other such things were made. Because of the infantile paralysis epidemic in Buffalo, the Crippled Children's Guild Hospital was overcrowded and _ it was thought it would be best to remember these children with the toys. Therefore, 130 separate toys and gifts were made and wrapped and most of them delivered to the children's ward of the Meyer Memorial Hospital on December 23. The remainder of the toys were distributed to the children of the Buffalo Branch at the annual Christmas party on Saturday evening, December 23, 1944. (See picture on preceding page. ) "Another project of interest was that of the Lancaster Branch Relief Society which gathered 106 articles of clothing and packed them and sent them to war refugees.: "In Syracuse, New York, the Syracuse Branch Relief Society held its annual bazaar on November 14. The Fulton, New York, Branch Relief Society joined with a booth of handiwork, as well as food. Such articles as hand-embroidered and crocheted linen of various descriptions were on sale, as well as pies, cakes, cookies, hot dogs, sweet cider, and homemade candy. A fish pond provided entertainment for adults and children as well. Though none of these sisters had ever made or worked on a quilt before, the beautifully appliqued quilt which they had ready for the bazaar sold for $26. The total proceeds from the bazaar amounted to $63.03. "The Philadelphia Branch Relief Society, with an active membership of ten, held a bazaar on December g which was well attended by the branch membership. The entertainment provided by the missionaries laboring in the mission office was especially enjoyable. A profit of $87.12 was realized." Northwestern States Mission HEA STOTT, counselor in the Golden Ridge Branch Relief Society, Great Falls District, reports as follows: "The Golden Ridge Relief Society, consisting of fifteen members, under the able leadership of Sister Armida Hanberg, president, has sponsored two outstanding NOTES FROM THE FIELD entertainments during the 1944-45 season. "A bazaar was sponsored in November. Articles were donated by members and some non-members. The Relief Society collected rags and prepared them for rugs at work meetings. Fourteen rugs were woven and sold at the bazaar. Materials for a quilt were donated by some of the members. It was quilted at work meetings and also sold at the bazaar. When all expenses were paid a profit of $163 was made. "On March 17 the organization sponsored the Annual Day entertainment. A delicious banquet, furnished by the members, was served on a_ beautifully decorated table. The table was arranged with candles, place cards, napkins and favors to carry out the Relief Society colors, blue and gold. All members and partners were in attendance. A dance was enjoyed after the banquet." Australian Mission GERTRUDE SHIRRA, counselor in the Brisbane Branch Relief Society, Queensland, Australia, writes: "Far away here in sunny Queensland we Relief Society sisters wish to express our appreciation to the General Board for the excellent suggestion of a patriotic program honoring our boys in the services, their mothers, wives and children. On Sunday, July 27, 1943, we celebrated our Society's twelfth anniversary by staging this patriotic program in the evening's meeting. "The church was suitably decorated with American and British flags. The congregation sang, "The Star Spangled Banner," and 53 ?National Anthem." The foreword and conclusion were given by Sister Irene Boulton in patriotic costume. A talk was given by Sister May Sharman on 'Our Boys as Missionary Soldiers.' A chorus, 'Lest We Forget,' was rendered by the Singing Mothers and daughters. "A Salute to the Flag," by two boy scouts. All servicemen present and wives and mothers of those away were then honored and had patriotic ribbons pinned on them. "After a talk by Sister Gertrude Shirra on 'Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom,' the congregation joined in singing "Victory Hymn.' "Community hymn _ singing. Which, as a regular feature for the entertainment of our visiting servicemen, follows each Sunday night's service, was then enjoyed, as were also refreshments. Lights were turned out and twelve candles were lit on a three-tiered birthday cake made and donated by Sister Ida Parker. Our president, Sister Harriet Dean, then blew out the candles successfully in one breath and our eldest member of the Relief Society, Sister Anna Gilbert, seventy-six, came forward and cut the cake which was passed to all. "We truly felt our efforts were immeasurably compensated. "Similarly, we celebrated our 13th anniversary and we acclaim both patriotic evenings as memorable occasions. "With Sister Harriet Dean, Sister Ethel Orth, and myself as a presidency, we are extremely happy to' mention that love and unity and enthusiasm pervade all our meetings and because of this we are truly grateful to our loving Father in  MEXICAN MISSION RELIEF SOCIETY President Mary D. Pierce and six Relief Society branch presidents.

Heaven who sheds his spirit upon us so bountifully." Mexican Mission "THE following is a report from the Mexican Mission by Sister Mary D. Pierce, president: "The regular semi-annual conference of the Mexican Mission was held May 18, 19, and 20. This year an exposition was held of work completed by the members of our mission in Relief Societies and in their homes. A medium-sized room of the chapel was filled with the articles brought in. Several quilts covered one wall, and the other three were covered by a variety of articles. There were lace tablecloths, embroidery work on towels, pillowcases, luncheon cloths, etc., drawn work, dolls, a child's crocheted dress, and a yellow organdy formal. On a table in the center of the room was a miniature plush living room set, several artificial flowers, a pair of leather gloves and a carved wooden plaque, tinted, of the Prophet Joseph Smith, made by one of the brethren. 'There was also a wall plaque of plaster that was very pretty "Immediately after the second session of the conference, everyone was invited to see the exposition, and a demonstration was given by Sister Pauline Green, under the direction of Sister Mary D. Pierce, NOTES FROM THE FIELD The members were shown how to cover the end of a quilt, so as to be -able to keep it clean longer. Sister Green also told them how to wash a quilt to get the best results. A demonstration was then given on how to paint cloth with crayolas and keep the color in, even after washing. This is very simple and easy to do, and you can make very pretty curtains, bedspreads, etc. With it. Each member was then given printed instructions on how to make pot holders, and two types of aprons that are especially useful. They were also shown the finished articles. "The demonstration ended with Sister Pierce telling the members that the project for the Relief Society this coming year is to have every family in the mission supplied with the number of quilts they need. "The exposition itself continued until the end of the conference. It was a real success, and if the members express a desire for it, we plan on having another one next conference." The mission further reports: "In one of the smaller branches of the Mexican Mission which is located in Atlixco, Puebla, a tiny Indian town about eighty-five miles southwest of Mexico City, a handful of faithful Mexican sisters carry on the regular Relief Society lesson work and activity. A typical example of their work is the special program which was held a short time ago in commemoration of the organization 55 of the Relief Society, March 17, 1842. Sister Mary D. Pierce reports that on the evening of March 19 a special celebration was held at the home of one of the members to which all of their husbands were also invited. "A play was presented centered about the lives of the six Relief Society presidents and each Mexican sister taking part gave a short sketch of the life and activities of one of the presidents. Two recitations and a song then were given with a short skit on temperance ending the program. Ice cream and cookies were served to those present. "The entire program was very simple and unelaborate, but it demonstrates that even among those of humble birth and little or no formal education, the Relief Society can go forward in the true spirit of our Church and carry on activities in which the whole group participates. The sisters of the Atlixco Branch, several of whom do not know how to read nor write, are all very poor and their lives are not much affected by this modern world, but they all joined together in planning and taking part in an evening of enjoyable entertainment in honor of the organization to which they belong. A detailed report of this program was sent in to Sister Pierce at the mission home in Mexico City by Sister Concepcion de Lara, Relief Society president in Atlixco."
