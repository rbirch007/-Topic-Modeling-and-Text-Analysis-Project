The United Order Begun and Its Establishment in the Settlements Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, April 2, 1946 Objective: To show how the Lord strives always to have his children seek the more perfect social order of living. THE gospel of Jesus Christ has been sent to the earth for the salvation of mankind. In many cases the saints, and more especially people of the world, have felt that this salvation is meant only for happiness hereafter. While no one can deny that it is the joy of eternal peace that is the ultimate goal of living, yet to insure such a hope it is necessary to labor for salvation in this mortal existence. Such being the case, anything, then, that blights and dwarfs our living here should be alleviated. Sick men cannot work. Poverty-stricken people have no spirit to do, nor can those who are trapped in the wages of sin find joy in future living. The Lord would stamp out all things that shackle the souls of men. This, of course, can only be done when men co-operate. The Lord can show the way, but if the benefits of his counsel are to be realized, his children must learn to listen and obey. Page 56 One of the first things the Master taught the early members of his Church was the need for working together. They were to share, as a group, the sorrows as well as the joys. There would always be poor among them. Just as sure as the rising sun, disappointments and reverses would always be a part of this life, and suffering would come as a result. The widow and the fatherless, the invalid and the weak, all must be assisted. The human heart is tender and the human soul has pride. Both of these must be considered even above the immediate relief of physical want. If they are not, the spirit and will to rise above difficulties breaks, leaving often but the shell of man, the outward form bereft of the divine light of his inner spirit. Few sights are more heart-rending LESSON DEPARTMENT than those to be viewed upon the park benches of great cities?human driftwood, cut free from the moorings of purpose in life. In his wisdom the Lord knows that there can be no true salvation for his people unless the evils of poverty and destitution can be controlled. This was the reason that, in the very beginning of the establishment of his Church in the latter days, he tried to bring about what is known as the law of the United Order or consecration of properties, To fully understand this law and its far-reaching effects swells the heart with love and kindness, for what greater joy is given man than to know he is of worth to others? You will recall that the Prophet Joseph Smith, before the fatal return to Nauvoo, said: "If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to While, as a People, the saints of early days were not quite equal to the responsibility of accepting this higher law of social living, still it has not all been loss to know of their failure. "A man's Teach should exceed his grasp, else what's a heaven for," writes the poet, Robert Browning. The lesson for this month can have but little in the way of history in a few communities in the far west, such as Orderville in Southern Utah. - in practice, the brethren in Missouri got away, in their attempts to set up the United Order, from the principles set out 57 in the revelations. This is also true of the organizations set up here in Utah after the saints came to the valleys. I the departure came by way of the nature of the title which was given to the Church and of the title which was reconveyed to the donor?in Practice it was a sort of "Tend-lease arrangement" as finally developed. The revelations and the instructions of the Prophet called for a fee simple conveyance of real estate by the donor to the bishop and an absolute bill of sale of the personal property of the donor also to the bishop. The bishop then granted back to the donor by the same sort of documents the donor's 'portion,' 'stewardship,' or ' inheritance.' In the Orderville experiment a regular communal organization apparently was set up and all property held in common. The Prophet Joseph had time and time again declared that the Church was not a communal organization. On one occasion, while attending a lecture on socialism, he declared, "I said I did not believe the doctrine." This was in 1843. ? ?President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Today on a Church-wide scale we may be nearing something of a United Order under the present Welfare Plan. Says President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.: Perhaps... When the Welfare Plan gets thoroughly into operation... We shall not be so very far from Carrying out the great fundamentals of the United Order, If the Welfare Plan is fully operative, we shall be able to care for every destitute Latterday Saint wherever he may be (Conference Address, 1942).  The law of consecration or the United Order is not, as some have supposed, a law doing away with Private Ownership. On the contrary, under this law each family in the Church would legally own enough Property to satisfy "his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs, inasmuch as his wants are just?" (Doc. And Coy, 58 82:17; 78:5-8). This would mean that the amount of property. Owned by the various families in the Church would of necessity vary since the needs of families are different. There would be equality, however, in that all families would have their needs. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked if the Mormon people believed in having all things in common his answer was "No." (D. H. C.. Vol. III, p. 28) In order to understand the true spirit of the law of the United Order it must be understood that basically all that we are and have really belongs to the Lord. He, therefore, can call upon us for our property as well as our lives since both are his in the first place (Doc. And Cov. 104: 14-17, 47-57). The amount of a man's property which should be retained by the Church and the amount he should receive back was to be determined as follows, as presented by the Prophet in a letter dated June 25, 1833 and addressed to Edward Partridge: "I proceed to answer your questions, concerning the consecration of property:? First, it is not right to condescend to very great particulars in taking inventories. The fact is this, a man is bound by the law of the Church, to consecrate to the Bishop, before he can be considered a legal heir to the kingdom of Zion; and _ this, too, without constraint; and unless he does this, he cannot be acknowledged before the Lord on the Church books: therefore, to condescend to particulars, I will tell you that every man must be his own judge how much he should receive and how much he should suffer to remain in the hands of the Bishop. I speak of those who consecrate more than they need for the' support of themselves and their families. "The matter of consecration must be done by the mutual consent of both parties; for to give the Bishop power to say how much every man shall have, and he be obliged to comply with the Bishop's judgment, is giving to the Bishop more power than a king has; and upon the other hand, to let every man say how much he needs, and the Bishop be obliged to comply with his judgment, is to throw Zion into confusion, and make a slave of the Bishop. The fact is, there must be a balance or equilibrium of power between the Bishop and the people, and thus harmony and goodwill may be preserved among you. "Therefore, those persons consecrating property to the Bishop in Zion, and then receiving an inheritance back, must reasonably show to the Bishop that they need as much as they claim. But in case the two parties cannot come to a mutual agreement, the Bishop is to have nothing ~ to do about receiving such consecrations; and the case must be laid before a council of twelve High Priests, the Bishop not being one of the council, but he is to lay the case before them." (Doc. Hist. 364- 65)?President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. When the parties reached an agreement, then the bishop would deed in fee simple the property agreed upon to the Church member. This the member would own outright as private property. The part of the member's property which was not turned back to him after these transactions had been made then became the common property of the Church to be used for the support of the poor in the Church. If a whole community of saints would thus comply with the law of the United Order there would be a feeling of equality among them, for all having been fair at first declaring their earthly possessions, they might by the same token feel free to call upon the bishop's store in time of need. The bishop, in tum, would be in the best position to administer such a "residue" of property (Doc. And Cov. 42:34-36), since he and his community would know that all had complied legally with the law of the Lord. Thus each saint would LESSON DEPARTMENT have his "Portion" or "Inheritance" from the common pool of properties or land first deeded to the Churchy. It was within the very first years of the Church that the Lord commanded his saints to obey the law of the United Order. By February of 1831, a number of the new converts had assembled in and about Kirtland, Ohio. It was the will of the Lord to have the members of the Church in New York assemble in Ohio. There would of necessity need to be preparations made for these people. Accordingly, Bishop Partridge was instructed to assign them lands after their arrival. At this time, the law of consecration was set into effect. The head of each family after having turned in his property was, in turn, issued a certificate for his portion and inheritance in the Church. Trouble came soon after this law went into effect since not all group played fair, The members of the Church from Colesville, New York, on their arrival in Ohio, were located at a place called Thompson, about sixteen miles northwest of Kirtland. Here, as we have learned, they were directed to live according to the Lord's law, that is, the order of stewardship and consecration of properties. Among these people there resided a man named Leman Copley, who was a member of the 'Shaking Quakers' before he joined the Church. He owned a large tract of land which he agreed to turn over to the Colesville branch to occupy in this manner of stewardship, agreeable with the revelation they had received. It appears that Copley had not been fully converted to the Gospel and he, with some others, later rebelled and broke the covenant of consecration. This caused confusion among the Colesville saints and placed them at the mercy of their enemies, as well as in jeopardy before the Lord. In their distress they sent Knight, who was in charge of the branch at Thompson, to the Prophet to learn what they should do. The Lord spoke unto them saying that their covenant had been broken and therefore was of no effect, and it would have been better for the one who was responsible for the offense, 'had he been drowned in the depth of the sea.' The members of the branch were now commanded to journey to Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites,' and there they were to seek 'a living like unto men' until the Lord might prepare a place for them (Essentials in Church History, page 127).  The Stories of other attempts to live the law of United Order are not unlike this one as to the Outcome some d e the Saints at times succeeded, but as a group they seemed not ready to comply with the will of the Lord in these matters. Today, with so many schemes abroad as to the best solution for a perfect social order, we as members of the Church might well look into the Lord's words and learn his will as did the people of Enoch.
