THE MORNING STAR Courtney E. Cottam Black is the night of my despair, Cold, cold before the dawn; Hope's congealed within my heart, My idols are fallen and gone; I am alone. In the anguish of my grief, One ray of hope shines through, The Morning Star, the Light of Christ, His promise, ever new; And night is gone. LETTER Nan S. Richardson Dear Emma: So you think I am feeble? how little you know About your big sister out here in the snow; I'll tell you about it, I'll be honest as of yore, In a very short time I will be eighty-four. To begin with, last year, I had passed eighty-three, Just what I could do, Santa Claus told to me. So I made fourteen doilies? some large and some small. Four pillow cases? handmade lace and all. I crocheted three shopping bags, they are handy and neat To take down to the stores and use on the street. To carry small parcels, Christmas ribbons and tags. To help out the salvage and save paper bags. Then came two house dresses? all trimmed with stitchin', Five calico aprons to wear in the kitchen. I help make my dresses, I trim hats and mend. One can always find sewing that never does end. Now I wash and I iron, I sweep with a broom; I mop and I cook and I clean my own room; I write dozens of letters, and this is no joke, If it weren't for me. Uncle Sam would go broke. To Relief Society sometimes I go To work on the quilts and help others sew; They sent me a bag of soft flannel scraps To make little quilts for sick men's laps. If my friends take the notion to have a nice lunch And if I'm invited, I go with the bunch; I dance and I sing, I have plenty to say. With the help of a stick I can walk every day. Old age makes one slow? I've lost all my speed. But you'll have to confess that I've not gone to seed. I get pretty tired, but I'm willing to try; And I'll never give up till the day that I die. I count all my blessings, dear sister, a score. Then why should I care if I am eighty-four! So I'm hoping these lines will bring consolation.
