Let Us Fittingly Mark the Land Elder Howard R. Driggs (Prepared at the Request of the Church Beautification Committee) home town of Pleasant Grove to Salt Lake City the other day, we saw an out-of-state car pausing before the roadside marker the Highway Commission has built to tell of the first battle of the pioneers with the Indians in Utah. Again, as we rounded the "Point of the Mountain," we observed another such car parked at the monument built by members of the adult Aaronic priesthood to commemorate the Pony Express. As the children in the party were reading the story on the bronze plaque, the father was taking a snapshot. Vivid memories of the first fast mail of the West, these young Americans would carry away to their home and schools. A letter from a dear old friend from Ohio was awaiting me when we reached our apartment. In part it read: I recall with a great deal of happiness our trip to the top of the Big Mountain and then down into the Valley following the route of the famous migration, and am glad to know that an appropriate memorial is to be erected. A nation without monuments, memorials and shrines is one without worth-while history. What makes travel interesting? Impressive scenery, yes; well-kept homes and farms, certainly; well-bred folk, of course. Yet, added to all this, is another thing that gives spiritual meaning to any tip. That is drama. People love to linger around places where things of import have been enacted. Precious landmarks and story spots lure travelers to linger and learn. Our National Capital with its throbbing activities is ever a place of a thousand attractions. It is there one may feel the pulse of the whole world. Yet most folk who visit the city are likely to remember best and longest?if they have the privilege? the trip down the quiet old Potomac to the home and the tomb of Washington. And all who go there are profoundly grateful that a patriotic group of Americans preserved in its beauty and storied significance the sacred shrine?Mount Vernon. Likewise are visitors to Philadelphia filled with gratitude that old Independence Hall, the home of Betsy Ross, and other shrines have been saved. We are deeply indebted, also, to those who have kept for us such historic landmarks as Old South Church, Paul Revere's home in Boston, the Alamo in San Antonio, Sutter's Fort in Sacramento. And our hearts go out always to the group of surveyors of the Burlington Railroad, who, finding the tire-marked grave of Rebecca Winters on the Mormon Trail, changed the survey to let this pioneer mother rest in peace. These sacred shrines, we should remember, do not save themselves. Nor do the old trails, where "Pilgrim feet?a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness," mark themselves. Page 31  OLD CENTRAL SCHOOL, PLEASANT GROVE, UTAH The wing at the left was built in part from the adobes used in the first Pleasant Grove schoolhouse built in 1852. The building is now used as a Hall of Memories by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers and the centerpiece of a park dedicated to these nation builders. Someone has to take the initiative in this labor of love. Others of kindred spirit must join in the work. And such patriotic service is done not merely to remember the past; it is ever for the living present and the future. Our West, like other realms in their youth-time, has been somewhat slow in conserving its wealth of historical resources. Old things that seemed to be in the path of progress have often been not only neglected, but at times _ ruthlessly cleared away for more modem, less significant creations. This is not only unsound patriotism, but poor business. Let us face for a moment the suggestion that there is real money value in storied landmarks. The writer once asked of the late curator of Sutter's Fort?who had helped to change a run-down story spot to one of historic attractiveness?"How many out-of-town visitors registered at this old Fort last year?" "Considerably more 100,000," was the reply. "How much money, would you estimate, did each visitor leave in this city?" "That would be difficult to say; but certainly $5.00 each would be conservative." "What other business in this town brings in as much outside money?" was a final question. APPLY this to the throng of tourists attracted into Salt Lake City by reason of its historical and other attractions, or put the test to other cities that have kept their storied shrines. Whatever may be the conclusions as to the amount of money that comes from a proper preservation of such resources, it must be agreed that they pay richly for the effort. LET US FITTINGLY MARK THE LAND Any community that fails to keep and develop its historical heritage is financially short-sighted. There is, however, a deeper tea son for doing so. That is the preservation and development of the character of the community. In the lives of our pioneers is a spiritual force to be treasured and perpetuated. Through the prophet saving of the storied places that vibrate their spirit?the marking of the trails they made historic?we keep reminders of their sterling worth. To appreciate the worthy past is to fortify the future. 33 Not all landmarks, of course, are worth saving. Those that do exemplify the sturdy virtues of our nation-builders?that are filled with cherished memories?are priceless. There should ever be discrimination in this work?selection and development, to conserve historical monuments and to make them educationally attractive and upbuilding. It is a pleasure here to commend the town of my birth?Pleasant Grove. Through the devoted work of the Daughters of the Pioneers there and the understanding help of the city officials, the old schoolhouse has been preserved as a monument to the pioneers, and the lot on which it stands made a park dedicated to their memory. PRESIDENT GEORGE ALBERT SMITH AT TRAPPERS' RENDEZVOUS, BEAR LAKE Photograph by John D. Giles, taken in August 1937. 34 Plans are to develop this story spot, with the city, Daughters and Sons of the Pioneers, and the schools co-operating, into a fine memorial. Here is a pattern which other communities might follow in their own fine ways with profit. What has gone into the building of a town or state makes its character ?gives it individuality. Communities that treasure their fine traditions, that preserve landmarks and relics to keep the courageous past alive and vibrant, stand out for all who live there or who visit them. Places that become merely a collection of houses and stores and service stations are passed by unremembered. It should be the pride of every town to develop its individuality. Certainly one of its storied buildings should be made a hall of memory?and it should have at least one block dedicated to the heroic men and women who gave their lives to the founding of the community. Another vital point: See that the historic trails that lead to your town are interestingly marked. Every community is linked with some such storied highway or byway?trails of the Indians, the pathfinding trappers, the pioneers. Many of these faded trails are in danger of oblivion. Here is challenging activity for young scouts, older ones who remember, and others, to reclaim a heritage and add to the attractiveness of the town and to travel. RECLAIMING A PONY EXPRESS STATION, "PASS" (DRY STATION) IN THE UTAH DESERT LET US FITTINGLY MARK THE LAND An awakening has come along these vital lines over the land. Many commendable things have already been accomplished by devoted, clear-seeing leaders in marking the trails and story spots, in developing wayside rests where travelers may linger and learn. Much more can be done. America is already again on the move. Years ahead will see throngs traveling. What is needed right now is well-directed, co-operative effort to help make this travel more 35 Why not center our efforts on teaching America? Why not do more to lure the speeding folk to linger and learn the dramatic story of the old trails? Why not stir every community to rise to its best?to bring out its fine American tradition ?its stirring pioneer story?its forward-looking history?, Nothing will do more for our country and the world than to keep alive the spirit of those who have given their all that this might be a land of freedom based on eternal righteousness. Opportunity is before every community to help impress this on the hearts of ??~<-?
