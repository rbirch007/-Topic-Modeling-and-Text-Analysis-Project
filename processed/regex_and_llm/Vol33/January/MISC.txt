THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE THE INFINITE Grace Sayre Where day has swept her silken sails of gold The sunset sky holds brightly bannered light; Beneath the evening's fast-diminishing glow The wet sand hollows lie in saucered mold. Upon the rocky ledge here at my hand I reach to lift a star-beam from the pool Of saucered sand, and dip my finger tips To place it on a shelving rock to cool. I lift my two cupped hands, high up, to hold The star that slips through trickling sands of gold. Where does this beauty go, when tides have cleaned The star-beams from each hollowed spot of sand? Why does the tide sweep loveliness away When I have held the universe in my hand? I can but trust my world to him to hold Who made the stars, the tides, the ocean's gold. The Cover: "Silhouette of Trees" from a photograph by Grace O. Tuttle. VOL. 33, NO. 1 JANUARY 1946 GENERAL PRESIDENCY OF RELIEF SOCIETY President Belle S. Spafford, Counselors Marianne C. Sharp and Gertrude R. Garff
