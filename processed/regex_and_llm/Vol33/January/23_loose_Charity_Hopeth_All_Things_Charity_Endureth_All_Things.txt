Charity Hopeth All Things, Charity Endureth All Things Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, April 2, 1946 Objective: To show that charity meets offense with patience, understanding, and hope. Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you,... Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven (Matt. 5:43-45). THIS is strong doctrine. Man seems to be more inclined by nature to give blow for blow than love for hate or good for evil. Critics and skeptics call this Christian ideal good for the kingdom of heaven, but not for this world. Still, we may ask, what does experience teach us? Not infrequently when a person is dealt with unfairly his first impulse is to fight for his rights, to rally the support of his friends, or even to return evil for evil in order to teach the offender the error of his ways. Experience reveals the folly of such a course of action, for argument only stirs more argument as the wind stirs the open fire; and evil not only increases evil, but justifies it in the mind of the first offender. A person of charity knows a better way to deal with an offense against him. Since "charity seeketh not her own," his first reaction to injury or criticism is not to engage in self-defense, but to look within himself to find the cause for the real or imagined offense. If, after making careful study and receiving wise counsel, he finds no cause within himself for the offense, then he is happy that the accusation against him is not justified. And since "'charity rejoiceth in the truth" he is willing to wait, to hope, and even to endure until truth can be his vindicator which it can be and will be far more effectively than he himself could ever be. Hardship and suffering make up a normal part of a person's life. The rains descend, the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon every life (See Matt. 7:24-27). Sometimes these things come upon us as
natural consequences of our own ignorance and sins; often they are 
the result of the ignorance and sins of others or of the natural conditions
of earth-life. Whatever their cause, they do not leave us untouched. One
who comes face-to-face with real struggle and suffering will never be
the same person again. Either he will increase in cynicism, bitterness,
melancholy or self-pity, or he will grow in humility, compassion, understanding,
and love. It isn't what happens to us, and more especially what is said about us, that matters, but our attitude towards these things and toward those who offend us. Charity is an unfailing source of strength which enables us to meet
life with courage and faith, with patience, understanding, and love. It
relieves its possessor of the burden of a wounded self and of the need
to waste energy in self-excuse and self-defense, in blame, or retaliation.
It frees the mind and heart for their larger task of knowing the truth and
loving the right. Charity does not mean submission to wrong and to
error; it means more strength for the right and for the truth. LESSON DEPARTMENT
Literature The Bible in our Literature Lesson 7-Bible Influence as Revealed in Sermons Essays, and Orations. Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, April 16, 1946 Added the treasured songs, stories, and Plays that have been created for our recreation, we have we have
a wealth of choice sermons, essays, and orations. As distinguished
from the lyric, epic, and dramatic types of literature, already presented
in these lessons, the sermon, essay, and oration are in a general sense
more didactic in purpose and spirit. They teach or portray facts and
truths of life with more directness. At times, this didactic type of literature
rises to classic heights. All Down the Stream of time men h Voiced their thoughts and feelings have voiced their thoughts and feelings have tried to do what they felt was
right. Often what was said rang with such force that it echoed and
re-echoed through the years. For illustration: We hold these truths to be Self-evident that all men are Created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ? Declaration oi Independence, Thomas Jefferson. 62 It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation, _ under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. ?Gettysburg Speech, Abraham Lincoln Only great occasions bring forth such soul-stirring expressions. When a nation is at a crisis, some leader usually rises to voice the heart of the people. When truth is soundly, aptly spoken, the words are caught up and passed on as maxims for guidance, as clarion calls to duty. Usually such expressions, as the ones above, are simple,. Direct, rhythmic, easy to remember. In word or spirit, they reveal Bible inspiration. In "times that try men's souls," those who bear the responsibility of leadership, almost unfailingly turn to Holy Writ for light and strength. During Britain's darkest days of World War II, when Winston Churchill could promise his people only "blood, sweat, toil and tears," he constantly held faith and courage before them in words such as these: The task which has been set us is not beyond our strength; its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our cause, and unconquerable will power, salvation will not be denied us. In the words of the Psalmist: "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." Later, when the clouds had lifted, he could look back through the dark days and say: All the world, even our best friends, thought that our end had come.... We were united in that solemn, majestic hour.... We faced our duty, and by the mercy of God we were preserved. Such bracing of men and women for their duties is by no means limited to times of deepest distress. In less degree it comes with everyday needs. All of us, great or small, are constantly saying things to try to help the world along. One thing that marks our daily talk is folk sayings that have come down as a homely heritage of wisdom. Everyone will recall some of these old, time-tested bits of advice that fell from the lips of grandmother, grandfather or parents, or some helpful-spirited neighbor. Here are just a few samples: Don't let the grass grow under your feet. Remember, a stitch in time saves nine. Honesty is the best policy. Handsome is as handsome does. Frequently a bit of wisdom came in verse, as: The Devil was sick?the Devil a monk would be; The Devil was well?the Devil a monk was he. ?Rabelais A goodly part of our didactic literature, indeed, is cast into verse form?this to make it easier to learn by heart. Songs sung in religious services are in large measure more didactic than lyric. A central purpose in their creation is to impress a gospel lesson. For illustration, take these typical lines: Count your many blessings Name them one by one; And it will surprise you What the Lord hath done. Let us oft speak kind words to each other, At home or where'er we may be. LESSON DEPARTMENT Poets, dramatists, novelists, frequently let life lessons flower forth in their creations. Oliver Wendell Holmes, for example, after pondering over a broken shell of a chambered. Nautilus, created a beautiful lyric on its life and growth, and closed with a message for himself and for all of us. Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, As the swift seasons roll! Leave thy low-vaulted past! Let each new temple, nobler than the last, Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, Till thou at length art free, Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea! Bryant's "To a Waterfowl," in which the poet pictures a bird winging its solitary way through the sky into the night, closes with these impressive lines: He who, from zone to zone, Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight, In the long way that I must tread alone, Will lead my steps aright. Life lessons such as these, which blossom naturally out of songs, stories or plays, are diamond truths in their settings. Our literature is sprinkled with like gems of thought ?made the more impressive because they are artistically presented. In harmony with all true teaching, they lead, guide, persuade, but do not "force the human mind." Preachers will do well to keep this basic principle, so marvelously exemplified in the life of the Master Teacher, constantly in mind. Our most effective ones do. Indirectly, rather than directly, they present 63 their lessons of life. As with the Savior, they often make the truth walk and talk through a well-told story. Occasionally when conditions demand, they speak with plainness, as did Jesus when he drove the money changers out of the temple, and when he rebuked the scribes and Pharisees. Generally, however, the approach to the hearts and minds is such that folk are stirred with the impulse not merely to be good but to do good. A few illustrations of what may be called persuasive preaching or teaching are the following: I sometimes think that we expect too much of Christmas Day. We try to crowd into it the long arrears of kindliness and humanity for the whole year. As for me, I like to take my Christmas a little at a time, all through the year. And thus I drift along into the holidays?let them overtake me unexpectedly?waking up some fine morning and suddenly saying to myself: "Why, this is Christmas Day." ?The Friendly Road, David Grayson It. Is hard for me to see how a great man can be an atheist. Without the sustaining influence of faith in a divine power we could have little faith in ourselves. We need to feel that behind us is intelligence and love. Doubters do not achieve; skeptics do not contribute; cynics do not create. Faith is the great motive power; and no man realizes his full possibilities unless he has the deep conviction that life is eternally important and that his work, well done, is a part of an unending plan. ?Fundamentals of a Successful Life, Calvin Coolidge. There is no real wealth in gold. People talk about being wealthy?about being rich; but place the richest banking company in the world upon a barren rock, with their gold piled around them, with no possible chance of exchanging it, and destitute of the creature comforts, and they would be poor indeed.... 64 Men and women who are trying to make themselves happy in the possession of wealth or power will miss it, for nothing short of the Gospel of the Son of God can make the inhabitants of the earth happy, and prepare them to enjoy heaven here and hereafter. Discourses of Brigham Young, pages 473-4, 483. Our national welfare should always be a theme deeply rooted in our minds and exemplified in our individual lives, and the desire for our nation's good should be stronger than political party adherence. The nation's welfare means the welfare of every one of its citizens. To be a worthy and a prosperous nation, it must possess those qualities which belong to individual virtues. The attitude of our country toward other nations should always be honest and above suspicion, and every good citizen should be jealous of our nation's reputation both at home and abroad. National patriotism is, therefore, something more than mere expression of willingness to fight, if need be. Gospel Doctrine, Joseph F. Smith, page 517. Latter-day Saints, of all people, should show excellence in didactic literature. Opportunity for such expression is abundantly afforded them. And they will grow in grace and power if they study and practice expressing uplifting thoughts that come to them?not in just commonplace style?but with sincerity, and simple artistry. As a practical suggestion: Appreciate the ideas God gives you by writing them in your own best language; also keep inspirational thoughts others express?a few strikingly effective ones that have impressed you. With such practice and appreciation, skill to write and to speak will grow in you. Thousands upon thousands of choice sermons, essays, orations have been created and will continue to be created down the years. Again, if time is not to be wasted on the mediocre, we must cultivate a sense of selection.. No two of us will choose the same; our backgrounds for appreciation differ; even our moods change. Yet, if there is to be an upbuilding of our lives, only that which promotes a love for the good, the beautiful, and the true will claim our time and attention. This does not mean that we shall choose only those selections which plainly are linked with the Bible in word or spirit. Much of our didactic literature, particularly of the essay type, is created largely to inform or entertain. Observe, for example, the following paragraph from one of John Burrough's nature sketches, The Apple: How they resist the cold! Holding out almost as long as the red cheeks of the boys do. A frost that destroys the potatoes and other roots only makes the apple more crisp and vigorous; they peep out from the chance November snows unscathed. When I see the fruit vendor on the street comer stamping his feet and beating his hands to keep them warm, and his naked apples lying exposed to the blasts, I wonder if they do not ache to clap their hands and enliven their circulation. But they can stand it nearly as long as the vendor can. No mention of the Bible in this apple sketch, yet it brings enjoyment and stirs good memories, as do all well-written and wholesome essays on nature. Literature that takes us out-of-doors, that opens our eyes to the wonder world around us, that lets us travel far and wide, even though we do not leave our firesides to do it?is always helpful, if it is clean and pure. We may get not only information, but interpretation of human folk and also some good fun from such reading. LESSON DEPARTMENT A classic book of travel that spreads a feast of geography, history, descriptions of nature and human nature for us, with bits of humor thrown in to spice the trip, is Mark Twain's Innocents Abroad. Most folk think of this great writer as merely a humorist. He is all that and more. Observe, for example, these soul-lifting lines from the book just named: Night is the time to see Galilee. ... Its history and its associations are its chiefest charm, in any eyes, and the spells they weave are feeble in the searching light of the sun. Then we scarcely feel the fetters. Our thoughts wander constantly to the practical things of life. . . . But when day is done, even the most unimpressionable must yield to the dreamy influences of this tranquil starlight. ... In the lapping of the waves upon the beach, he hears the dip of ghostly oars; in the secret noises of the night he hears spirit voices; in the soft sweep of the breeze, the rush of invisible wings. Phantom ships are on the sea, the dead of twenty centuries come forth from the tombs, and in the dirges of the night wind the songs of forgotten ages find utterance again. In the starlight, Galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the heavens, and is a theater meet for great events; meet for the birth of a religion able to save the world; and meet for the stately Figure appointed to stand upon its stage and pro-claim its high decrees. . . . One can com-prehend it only when night has hidden all incongruities and created a theater proper for so grand a drama. With his vivid word pictures, his humorous touches, his sharp shafts at the sham and show and mockeries that bring unholiness to sacred placess, the author takes us round the land of Palestine, and leaves us, as he does in the above paragraphs, with deeper appreciation of the inner meaning and significance of storied places round which we linger with him in that Holy Land. Another selection which brings us closer to the spirit of religion and to the heart of a great American, comes from a treasured book, presented to the writer by President Grant, Abra-ham Lincoln? Man oi God, by John Wesley Hill. In this volume, rich with incidents of Lincoln, is a story told by one of his boyhood friends. This friend, on invitation, had ac-companied Lincoln to the home of a woman who had but a few hours to live. She had requested that her will be made before she passed away. When this was done, she said to Lincoln, "Now I have my affairs in this world arranged satisfactorily. I have also made preparation for the life to come. I do not fear death. I am glad that I am soon to meet those who have gone before." ' T our faith in God is wise and strong," said Lincoln. "Your hope of a future life is blessed." She then asked him if he would not read a few verses from the Bible. They offered him the Book; he did not take it but began reciting from memory the Twenty- third Psalm. Then he quoted the first part of the fourteenth chapter of John, 'In my Father?s house are many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you.? After he had given these and other quotations from the scriptures, he recited several hymns, closing with "Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me." "A little while after the woman passed to her reward," said the friend. "As we rode home in the buggy, I expressed surprise that he should have acted as pastor as well as attorney so perfectly, and Lincoln replied, 'God and eternity were very near me today.'
