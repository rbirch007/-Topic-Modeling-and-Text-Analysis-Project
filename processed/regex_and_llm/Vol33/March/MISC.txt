THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 33, NO 3 MARCH 1946 Alice Morrey Bailey The cleaning wind of March is riding high And jubilant across the smoke-thinned town. Before his cutting breath, the ice flows down; Beneath him, mud-choked streams go swirling by. He sweeps exuberant clouds across the sky, While swelling earth appears in naked brown, And timidly puts forth her new green gown. And with the wind there comes the wild bird's cry. Swing wide your doors and windows, oh, my soul, Long closed against the stinging winter's blast; Look far in heaven's blue inverted bowl. Let light and laughter wash you clean at last, Remove all petty hurts and nurtured pain, And let eternal springtime in again. E The Cover: 'Dry Valley," the desert between Moab and Monticello, Utah. Photograph by Willard Luce. VOL. 33, NO. 3 MARCH 1946 "SINGLE ROSES" From a Water Color by Artemesia R. Romney
