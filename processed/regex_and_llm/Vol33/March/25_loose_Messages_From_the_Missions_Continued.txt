MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS (Continued) Finland District, European Mission HE following excerpts are from a recent report from Europe sent to Elder Thomas E. McKay: "The acting Mission President, Elder C. Fritz Johansson and Elder Claus A. Person from Malmo, accompanied by Sister Astrid Johansson, a representative from the Mission Relief Society Board, made a journey to Finland August 7, 1945. "Journeyings in Finland are at present very fatiguing on account of heavy railroad traffic, worn-out equipment, engines and cars being in repair, and facilities at hand being far below the needs. 'The crowding of cars forced our party to stand up one whole night. "However, to the good and faithful saints in Larsmo Branch, situated close to Jacobstad, it was a great joy when the travelers arrived August 10, at 5:28 a. M. A special meeting was held on Saturday, the 11th, under the direction of the acting mission president. The first Relief Society in Finland was organized. A glorious spirit reigned, and often our thoughts turned to the day when the first Relief Society in the world was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith. "The Spirit of God Like a Fire is Burning' was sung and prayer Page 206 was offered by Elder Claus A. Person, after which 'If the Way Be Full of Trial Weary Not' was sung. "Acting Mission President C. Fritz Johansson thereupon greeted the saints present and Sister Astrid Johansson spoke of her appreciation of the opportunity to come to Larsmo to assist in organizing a Relief Society. She invoked the guidance of the Lord upon all present and explained that the purpose of the Relief Society organization was to help and to serve the members and our fellow men and to disseminate light and sunshine in a dark and dismal world. "The following points were discussed: 1. The fundamental aims of the Society. 2. The proper organization, president, counselors, and secretary. 3. The duties of teachers. 4. Meeting regulations. 5- Manuals. 6. The use of the help fund. 7. Reports and yearly dues. 8. Dressing the dead. G. Unity of board members. 10. The slogan: 'And above all these things put on chanty, which is the bond of perfectness' (Coloss. 3:14) was read. "Sisters were thereupon appointed to the different offices in the organization they had just completed and NOTES FROM THE FIELD were set apart in the branch meeting the following day. All expressed their joy and appreciation for the privilege of working in the Lord's cause, knowing that if they sought God in prayer, he would assist them and the work would go forward. Elder Berg said this was such an organization as they had been longing for, and he appreciated the visit of the mission authorities. "Be Ever Glad, Ye Daughters of Zion' was sung by Sisters Viola and Inga Ronnkvist, Vera Numan, and Georgina Back. Elder Claus A. Person spoke on the work of the Relief Society, a labor of love which will be written in the Book of Life. "Acting Mission President C. Fritz Johansson was the final speaker. He referred to the important event when. The Prophet Joseph Smith in the name of the Lord turned the key for this Society. Brother Johansson wished the sisters success in their work. The meeting closed with singing 'O Lord, Let Me Come to Zion's Land' and the benediction was pronounced by Elder J. Viktor Berg. All felt that the spirit of God was present in rich abundance and our hearts were filled with thanks to God for our membership in his Church. Besides the authorities from Sweden, those present were: Branch President J. Viktor Berg and the First Counselor Anselm H. Stromberg. The following were appointed to preside over the Relief Society: Sister Anna Stromberg, President; Sisters Johanna Soderholm and Inez Ikalainen, First.

North Central States Mission ANN J. KILLPACK, President of the North Central States Mission, reports a mothers' and daughters' banquet, a social, and an old folks' party: MOTHERS' AND DAUGHTERS' BANQUET BILLINGS BRANCH "As a fitting climax for the year's Relief Society activities, sisters of the Billings Branch met together May 29, 1945 at a mothers' and daughters' banquet at which more than a hundred were in attendance. One of the oldest mothers present was Sister Mercy Elery who was a convert to the Church four years ago. This dear sister is very faithful in Church activity and many times has expressed her joy and gratitude for having been privileged to live long enough to find the true Church of Christ. She is now making plans to go to the temple to take out endowments. "Relief Society officers, Lucy Call Taylor, President; Johanna Sanderson, First Counselor; Edna B. Collins, Second Counselor; and Mary Grebe, Secretary, feel very grateful for the fine spirit of co-operation manifest among class leaders and fellow members. A great deal has been accomplished through this combined co-operation of the sisters. Visiting teachers have been very active and have awakened active participation among a large percentage of the branch membership. A_ Singing Mothers' group is very active and has contributed much toward musical entertainment, and the branch organization attained placement on the honor roll of The BILLINGS (MONTANA) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY North Central States Mission, Mothers' and Daughters' Banquet Photograph submitted by Ann J. Killpack, President, North Central States Mission Relief Societies. All of this has been accomplished through combined effort and co-operation which is the spirit of all true Latter-day Saint women." MOTHERS' AND DAUGHTERS' SOCIAL "The ladies of the Minneapolis Branch Relief Society entertained at a mothers' and daughters' social Wednesday, June 27, 1945. An invitation to attend was also graciously extended to the fathers and sons. The crowd was delightfully entertained by a program of poetry, dancing and music. Later they re tired to the recreation room where a tasty luncheon was served, and some danced to polka music. This was especially fitting as most of the members are from Scandinavian countries. "This social terminates what has been a very successful year of Relief Society activities. The sisters are especially proud of a rummage sale which they recently held. This sale netted them a profit of $103.84. All of the goods sold was donated by the sisters in the branch. A willingness to serve is manifest by all, and this is the true spirit of Relief Society work." OLD FOLKS' PARTY MINNEAPOLIS BRANCH "The ladies of the Minneapolis NOTES FROM THE FIELD Branch who were over sixty years of age met together at the North Central States Mission Home, March 22, 1945, for an afternoon of renewing friendships with sisters in the gospel. Ten of the thirteen women in attendance were converts. Most of them had heard the gospel in foreign lands and had given up friends, family, and all they held dear there to join the Church and come to the land of Zion, yet none of them felt that the sacrifice was too great, for through the gospel, they have learned to know real joy. They are happy in the knowledge that they have found the true Church of Christ. These sisters have been very faithful in Relief Society and other auxiliary work and are very regular in their attendance RES Sg OM... Fl 209 when the weather and their health permit. "An afternoon's entertainment and refreshments were provided by President William L. Killpack; his wife, Ann Jane Killpack, Mission Relief Society President; and missionaries Norma Baldwin, Marjorie Yeates, and Caroline Stucki." Northern California Mission MARY S. ELLSWORTH, President of the Northern California Mission Relief Society, reports: "Salinas, like twelve other branches in the mission, is doing all it can to assist the priesthood in obtaining money for a new church building. I think throughout the mission that they all realize how much better 4 MINNEAPOLIS (MINNESOTA) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY North Central States Mission, Old Folks' Party.

Ellsworth said, "The hall is not a church. The meetings held in it seem to be just group meetings. All are determined, as soon as the priority is lifted, to have money ready to do something toward their own church building. "The sisters of the Salinas Branch gave a dinner, charging $5.00 a plate, and they were enabled to clear $215. During the summer months they are having a luncheon at each other's homes, taking their husbands and whoever else will join them, charging them fifty cents each and the other day they cleared $40."

The Relief Society of her district: The sisters appear to be receiving "In spite of war conditions, our Themore Relief Societies are still holding their regularly now." We protest earnestly and with determination. We protest existing policies which encourage the consumption of liquor, with all the far-reaching consequences of that consumption. We protest the expansion of the liquor traffic and its freedom from the reasonable restrictions which would contribute to reconversion. We protest the use of thousands of tons of raw materials in making intoxicants.  Deets Picket, from The Voice, December 1945. Ze Work Meeting
