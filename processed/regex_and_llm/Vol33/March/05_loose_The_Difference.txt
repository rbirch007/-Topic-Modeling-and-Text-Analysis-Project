THE DIFFERENCE Cleo Gordon A black wind shrieked, but you and I Went out to battle with heads held high; And fighting through it, arm in arm, Found weird beauty in the storm. Today I watch in sheltered pain Frail flowers whipped by driving rain; Now, fearfully, I shrink to see How wild and bitter a storm can be.
