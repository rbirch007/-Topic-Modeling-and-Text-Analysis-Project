THRIFT BEGINS IN THE GARDEN For salads, soups, and for flavoring meats, these herbs are miracle workers. Some clever cooks use differ-ent combinations of herbs for steep-ing in vinegar to make exotic flavors that are intriguing, to say the least. Dill for pickles, mint for flavoring fruit juices, and sage for sausages, are only a mere beginning of what may be done with herbs. Most of these plants are so small that they may be used for borders around flower gardens or vegetable plots, but many gardeners prefer to make a special small bed near the kitchen door for the handy herbs. Yet even window boxes may be utilized for growing them. If you have trouble in finding a sunny spot for cucumber or tomato plants, try planting these useful ornamentals in tubs or barrels and set them along the edges of the cement path or in a corner of the porch. Dis-carded metal vats of different shapes and sizes, large kettles or cans, such as may be salvaged from junk yards, serve very well for this purpose. If you wish to be exceedingly thrifty put a hive of bees in the corner of y our yard and then even your flowers can be useful by producing nectar for the hive. Bees can be raised and cared for with very little expense and they are pleasant friends to have about. Buy prepared "combs" so that your bees can spend all their time making honey. Certainly a practical garden can be a real adventure along the road to self sufficiency, and you may find yourself providing the neighbors with occasional treats. You might even make some sales to the corner grocery. At least you can help to win the battle of the board bill. SANCTUARY Roberta Bates I find when I can face the world no longer, A solace here among the things you loved. This dusty chair before your battered desk, Where oft you sat to invite as fancy moved. Is cool and soothing to my aching head. And if those useless tears again should start To drop unheeded, it is just because These worn-out slippers left a deep imprint Upon my heart. Even the Frail Christie Lund Coles RITA BERNSTROM looked through the open window and knew that this was the hardest time of day to bear this hour between light and darkness when the earth and sky seemed luminous, bell like in their clarity. It was as if every sight and sound might break the heart the gilt of the sun sifting through the window, the cool, dark shadow of the lilac bush across the foot of the bed. She could hear the neighbor women clanging kitchen utensils as they Prepared the evening meal. She could hear the shouts of children, the slide of their roller skates. She could even hear the neighbor women clanging kitchen utensils as they prepared the evening meal. She could hear the shouts of children, the slide of their roller skates. She could even hear the grunt of the of the rope as two children "pumped" each other in the back-yard swing. Men were coming home from work, dogs were barking, running after the occasional car that passed on the quiet street, sending the dust spiraling upward. She closed her eyes, listened as the radio played softly an old tune that swept over her in waves of light and darkness, waves of memories that were gay and tender. She was in a pink tulle dress, leaning backward in Brock's arms, laughing, saying, "You wouldn't fool me, would you, Mister?" dancing, whirling. Brock was smiling his one-sided smile, slowly, briefly, telling her seriously, "I'll never fool you, Rita. I love you too much. I'm going to malty you and we're going to have..." Page 186 She murmured softly, "Yes. I know. We're going to have a white house with green shutters... And five sons and maybe a daughter." His arm tightened about her and she felt his lips on her hair. And maybe a daughter! What casual words. Sons weren't so important, she supposed, not when the daughter was Eleanor Eleanor with her dark hair and blue eyes, blue as the sky at noon, like morning glories in the sun. She turned her head on the rumpled pillows. She was terribly tired. That was strange because one shouldn't get tired just lying, just thinking.... After a moment, she opened her eyes. She heard footsteps on the porch. Through the window she could see Mrs. Smith's tall, gaunt form, her bony fingers clutching a Stay sweater about her. Rita's heart began pounding. Instinctively, she reached over to close her door. She didn't want to see anyone. But Mrs. Smith gave a brief knock and walked in. She stood in the doorway, looking appraisingly about the room before she said, "Still down? Oh, dear..." There was no point in reminding Mrs. Smith that she would be down for a long time yet, so Rita only repeated the words, "Still down." Then, "Sit over there, won't you?" The other woman shook her head, "No, I haven't time. I've got to get Supper going. There's always so much to do. You're lucky to be able to lie here and test. Sometimes, I think if I gave up..." She sighed as if words could not tell of her affliction. 'Tm sorry," Rita said, "what does the Doctor think is wrong?" 'The Doctor . . . pshaw! What do they know ? "Once more she looked about the room and Rita was aware of the dust, of the bed's disorder. Then Mrs. Smith was leaving, say-ing, "If there's anything I can do ... let me know." "RITA smiled ironically, closed her eyes. Her weariness was alive with a sudden, gnawing unhappiness. She wanted to weep, but there were no tears, not any more. Why did that woman come, why did anyone come, with their curious eyes. She wanted to be alone, to shut her door, to wait here in the stillness where even pain wasn't as real as the figures moving in her mind, the bits of poetry. Emily Dickinson had said, "I measure every grief I meet with analytic eyes. I wonder if it weighs like mine or has an easier size ..." She heard Eleanor and her friend coming in at the back door. For a moment she even resented that intrusion. She listened to them as they discussed a radio program of the night before. Eleanor was saying, "She said, 'Goodbye, goodbye Steve.' She was in love with him. Then she crashed.' " Suzanne, the other child, added, "Yes. She said 'Goodbye, goodbye Steve.' I don't get it . "'Now they were entering her room, bringing in the evening paper. They were so sweet, each emerging into long-legged little girlhood. Eleanor squeezed her tightly and asked, "Are you all right, Mommie? Is there anything you need?  Rita kissed her smooth, firm cheek, "Not a thing," she told her, remembering how each time her daughter went out to play she would place a glass of water beside her, some tissues, and her digitalis. She would say, "Now you won't need anything until I come back." Suzanne stood back smiling shyly. Rita was sorry she had even momentarily resented her coming in. There were no questions to be answered in a child's eyes, no doubt. Children took the world on faith. She reached out to the child and Suzanne came into her arms as naturally as vapor emerges into sun-light. "You're awful sweet," Suzanne said, squeezing her, "I love you." Eleanor looked puzzled as she asked her friend, "Why do you love my mother? I don't love yours." Suzanne only smiled, and Rita said, "I like her to love me." Then, "Shall I read you the funnies?" She knew that was the thing that had brought them in. And why not? Who would stop skating, swinging, just to ask how a sick person felt or if she wanted anything. Each of them curled up on the bed beside her while she read, but when she had finished she did not keep them there as she tried to do other nights, telling them Bible stories or little jokes. She was in no mood for talk. Her world had strangely become a dark snood, shut-ting out the reality of everything. And she didn't care. She didn't care. But Brock would be coming soon. He would come in, the dog jumping about his feet. He would put his lunch pail down on the kitchen sink, go into the bathroom, wash his hands, splash water over his face and dark hair, whistling as he did so. "Hello," he would say slowly, coming into her room, drawing the word out into almost three syllables. He would pick up the evening paper _where Eleanor had left it, glance at it, and finally, bend over and kiss her. Even after nine years of marriage it was not a perfunctory kiss. It was tender and warm and sometimes, she was sure, it said all the things, the "How are you, my dear? I hope you've had a good day," that he was too inarticulate to say. At times it hurt her that he didn't say more, ask more. Then she would remember one night when he took her in his arms and cried, brokenly, "Oh, I'm so sorry for you. So terribly sorry." She knew it was better this way. Neither saying what was in the mind, each pretending. And it wasn't hard to pretend when he was here, for something within her bubbled with warmth and elation... Especially on Sundays when he and Eleanor would prepare Sunday dinner, then bring it in on a gaily bedecked tray. Each would take credit for whatever was best, each would deny having made the lumpy gravy. OFTEN, when the dishes were washed, Eleanor would come in and they would play Chinese checkers. Brock would pretend complete interest in whatever he was doing in the living room but soon he would be drawn in, would ask with his slow, one-sided smile, "Do you think you can beat me?" "Oh, I daresay," she would assure him, smiling up into his eyes, watching him as he picked up the board, arranging the brightly colored marbles so they could all three play until she was tired and forced to sink further into the rumpled pillows. She knew she was lucky to have Brock, but there were times, like this, when she was overcome by a horrible, clawing ache. She resented this frail body with its great weariness, its swift heartbeats. She even resented him and his kindness. She didn't want him doing her work, having the neighbors pity him. She turned her head to the wall and let her eyes travel for the unnumbered time up the pink wall paper, trace the white flower upon it. Brock had papered a few months ago. He thought it would make lying here easier. But already there were smudges on it where Eleanor touched it when she crawled into bed with her after her daddy left in the morning. She sighed as she heard Brock's car in the driveway. Now, the game would go on. He would pretend he didn't mind having a wife who couldn't measure up to the name. She had been gay and _ vivacious when he had married her, though not as strong as some women because of an old heart ailment. But she had kept the house, taken care of things until after Eleanor's birth. Then, she had gradually grown more tired, less able to make her ener, teach... Until the collapse. She recalled the small, intent doctor telling her she would have to have complete rest for at least a year, maybe longer. She remembered telling Brock, "Some people in the world would make quick work of my kind of person. EVEN THE FRAIL They don't let them hang on and suffer." He had looked at her "Don't be silly." But it was true, and perhaps, it was better. Suddenly, she put her hands over her eyes as her mind's shutter opened on the picture of a little girl, her beautiful little daughter. Each day, almost each time she came into the house she called to her mother immediately after opening the door, called and waited. If there was no answer she called again, an urgency, a fear in her voice that, please God, should never have been there. Darkly, ROCK seemed slower in coming to her room. It seemed more of an effort for him to take his eyes from the paper and kiss her. And as he bent down, she saw new lines about his mouth, lines put there, no doubt, by worry and unhappiness. She asked him, through force of habit, "How is everything at the plant?" "Fine," he assured her, not noticing her preoccupation, the look in her eyes. Then, "what would you like to eat?" "It doesn't matter," she said quietly. It didn't matter. It would probably be the same as always, meat and potatoes, string beans or carrots, canned fruit from the basement. What would she like, really? Creamed chicken on toast, shrimp salad, something green and crisp and appetizing, something cool and light. He left her room and shortly afterwards she heard Gloria at the back door, Gloria Ross, the neighbor girl who came in on Saturdays and helped with the cleaning. "Hi" she greeted Brock now, "how'd you like me to come and help get supper?" "Fine," he assured her, "you said you would some time. I'm getting tired of my own cooking. Not that it's not good, mind you." Gloria laughed, "Oh, I'm sure it is delicious." She was soon rattlin pans in the small, bright kitchen, the kitchen Rita loved with its crisp white and red curtains, the huge bay window which caught both the morning and the afternoon sun. She had so loved working there, baking on cloudy days, ironing. They talked of the good weather, Gloria's school work. Then she squeeled, "Turn on the radio! Har. Ty James! And is he the stuff?" After a second she went on, "Or can Mrs. Bernstrom stand it?" "She doesn't mind," Brock assured her, stepping into the other room to snap the radio on. Ordinarily it wouldn't have bothered her, but tonight it seemed the jive music was pounding upon her. But she didn't speak of it. She reached over to close her door and as she did so, she could see into the kitchen, could see Gloria holding out her dress, doing a little dance step as she told Brock, "This is getting in the groove." ITA could see the smile on Brock's face, the youngness there that she hadn't seen in a long time, too long. The thought came to her and she couldn't get it out of her mind  that he might care for Gloria. After all, it could be. She was young and vivacious, all the things his wife had left behind. And she couldn't blame him. It didn't matter. She was in 190 a place apart from them, a place with a closed door between. She heard a car door close outside just as Brock and Gloria were taking out her dishes. Brock said, "I guess that's Peter. I met him yesterday and he said he was coming out." Rita brushed at her hair with fluttering hands, "Why didn't you tell me?" she asked. "I guess I never thought of it," he answered casually, "I'll let him in." Gloria hurriedly gathered up the paper on the bed saying, "Til fix these then beat it through the back door." As Gloria slipped away Rita heard the voice of her husband's brother. He was successful, immaculate, somewhat condescending. She knew where his sympathies lay. And why not? Why shouldn't he pity Brock with his nose to the grindstone, paying doctor bills, growing old before his time. Once more she wanted to close the door, but Brock was bringing him in, he was asking how she felt, saying cheerfully, "You're going to be all right." "Of course," she agreed. Course." Just like that! After a few more words the two men went out and she reached over and closed her door quietly. She wouldn't need to see him again since it was an agreement between her and her husband that when it was shut she did not want to be disturbed. She thought she could sleep, but sleep was for those who were at peace, those who were weary from work or play. She heard the two brothers step out onto the front porch. She heard "Of Eleanor talking to her dolls in her own room. The spring evening was sweet and still. Through the open window she could have heard the two men talking but she didn't listen, she didn't want to listen until she heard Brock say, "How is Erma?" Erma was Pete's wife. She was everything that Rita wasn't, "disgustingly healthy," she described herself. Impervious, and beautiful. Peter answered, "She's fine I imagine." Then, "I seldom see her. She's forever at this luncheon or that club." "War work, too, I suppose," Brock went on. She was amazed at the irony in Peters voice, "Erma? Don't be funny." Brock told him that she, Rita, had written many letters to soldiers, and knit a couple of sweaters. He was trying to justify her lying here, she thought. Peter said, "She doesn't look too well. She's lucky to have you." Her husband didn't speak and she held her breath as she waited. She heard him laugh shortly before he disagreed, "Oh, I don't know." He seemed to be trying to find words and she thought: Now, all the bitterness and tiredness and resentment will come out. After a moment, he said, "No, Peter, she's not especially lucky. I'm the lucky one. She's so darn sweet. She has taught me a lot of things." After a moment, he went on hesitantly, "You know, Pete, if we were all strong we wouldn't ever need fight a defensive war. In many countries they 'take care' of the weak, put them out of the way, here, we fight for them, for the right of EVEN THE FRAIL even the frail to live and do good in their own way. Who knows, it may be a farther-reaching good than that of the strong." Suddenly, her nails dug into the flesh of her palms, they were wet with perspiration. Peter laughed good-naturedly, almost enviously, "Then I suppose you are both mighty lucky." Brock agreed, "Yes. I think we're ALL mighty lucky. Just living in America is really something." There was no tiredness in his 191 voice, no bitterness, just the honest goodness that was Brock. He wasn't sorry for her. He thought she was lucky, AND SHE WAS. She was. She turned her face to the pink wallpaper and lay very still looking at it, at the gray smudges. Tears, good, healing tears filled her eyes, spilled on her cheek. She reached over to the closed door, opened it wide, calling as she did so, "Eleanor, darling, don't you want to come in and say your prayer by my bed?" SHE HANGS THE LINEN ON THE LINE Dott J. Sartori Here is snow impervious To March's melting weather. Here is white unsullied as An egret's flowing feather. Here, in intermittent drifts, In cities without number, Are hung the linens of the land, Companions of our slumber. Here will snow shine glacier-clean As long as there shall be A home and need, and one who smooths A pillow tirelessly. The Best Little Shrub Mabel Harmer LINE MORTENSEN arose A briskly from the luncheon table and started putting leftovers back in the refrigerator. "What's the rush, Mother?" asked her husband mildly, teaching for another of the fresh, sugar-coated doughnuts, "are Tidwells having another remnant sale?" "It's my day to go visiting teaching and Henry!" she exclaimed, stopping short in the midst of scraping the jelly dish, "that's at least five doughnuts! Is that what you call watching your waistline?" "You shouldn't tempt me," he sighed. "I'll start cutting down tomorrow I think. What was that song you were singing a while ago?" "Oh, something I heard at Church the other day, It goes like this: If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill Be a shrub in the valley, but be The best little shrub by the side of the rill Be a bush if you can't be a tree. That's all I can remember. I just thought it sort of fitted me. I've always been the shrub type never had any big positions in the Church like Emmaretta and some of the others. She's been put in the Relief Society stake presidency now, you know. I guess being a visiting teacher is about as high as I'll ever get." "Well, you're a pine around this house," said Henry gallantly, as he pushed back his chair, "and don't let any of those female women keep you talking until you're late for dinner." "Don't you ever think of anything but eating?" sighed Aline, taking off her kitchen apron and hanging it in the broom closet. "Sure. Right now I'm wondering if I have time fora ten minute snooze before I have to get back to work." "No. But take it anyway or you'll be worrying about it all afternoon. Shall I wear my navy dot this afternoon or the rose print? Isn't it nice to have two dresses so that you can choose between them?" "Wear the rose, of course," answered Henry, breaking his yawn in the middle. "If you're going to be a shrub you might as well be a rose shrub. And don't forget to come home. When you and that Janet Meeks get together " "Janet can't go today," said Aline, bustling off to the bedroom. "I have to go alone." "Well, don't forget to come home anyway. I get mighty lonesome while you're making up formulas for the Wilkins baby and reading to old Sister Ballard." "Why, Henry," chuckled Aline. "You know that I don't do that very often." "No, just once a month," he answered drowsily. HALF an hour Jater Aline, fresh as a June morning in her rose print and white linen hat, was hurrying down the street. "I do hope that Retta Hubbard has good news of her grandchild by now," she mused, "and that Ellen Crabtree has decided to try and get along with her THE BEST LITTLE SHRUB mother-in-law. Dear me, it's always something and it's so hard to decide just how much I can do without going too far." As she turned onto a neat walk, lined with brilliant petunias, she added, "I wish that everyone was as nicely settled as Daphne Rhoades here. A pretty new home, a fine young husband and a darling baby. I'll just peek in here for a minute and then hurry on." Daphne Rhoades sat staring across the luncheon table with unseeing eyes. The sound of a back door as Rod had slammed it shut barely registered on her consciousness. A door crashing was nothing when her whole world had just gone to smash. This was most certainly the end. There was no use trying to make a go of it any longer. She might just as well get out and find a job now while she was still young and had only one child to support. Mentally she rehearsed the bitter scene that she and Rod had just been through as if trying to convince herself that it had really happened. Within ten minutes after he had come home for lunch she had known that something was wrong when he failed to go in to the baby or mention the scones which were his special favorite. Pausing by his chair, she had laid down the plate with the piping hot scones and, tweaking his ear playfully, had said, "All right, out with it. Have you quarreled with the boss or lost that wallet I gave you for Christmas?" "Tt's worse than that," he had answered heavily. "Sit Daphne. I night just as well tell you first as last. Uncle Steve came in down, 193 this morning to see me. He's in an awful jam. Aunt Marty's just had an operation and he had to have three hundred dollars for the hospital. 3 told him how it was with us but " "Oh, Rod!" she cried. "You didn't give it to him? Not again!" "But Daphne," he pleaded, his eyes looking tragically old in his young face, "what else could I do? He had to have some money and there wasn't another soul he could turn to." "He'd have had to turn somewhere else if you hadn't given it to him," she answered stonily. "Everyone else comes first with you and it's your own family last. You know how badly I want this house. And we've worked so hard to make that down payment. When I think of how I've scrimped and saved one nickel at a time to get that three hundred dollars and then you hand it over without even asking me. Now Jones will sell it to someone else." The first of the hot tears came, to be followed by many more. "There wasn't any need of asking you," said Rod tonelessly. "He had to have it. And he'll make every effort to pay it back." "He may have the best intentions in the world but it will be the same story over again," she retorted. "Your father intended to pay his back too, when he got the money for that extra piece of land." "But he will, just give him time," interrupted Rod. "Two years is quite a bit of time," said Daphne icily. "And then your sister had to have the next bit to go to New York." "But Jed only had a week's furlough and maybe it's the last time 194 she'll ever see him. I couldn't refuse  not my own sister," he pleaded. "Don't I know it?" she snapped. "And now here it is again. And not even one of your own family. Next you'll be handing out our savings to every acquaintance that comes along and happens to be in a tight pinch and I never will have a home of my own or any security. Well, I'm not going to stand for it. I'll get out and earn my own money and keep it where your relatives can't get their hand's on it." It was at this point that Rod, white-faced and shaken, had risen from the table, without ever having touched his lunch, and gone out of the house, and now Daphne, in her agitation, sat rocking the baby and giving vent to her angry thoughts and emotions by talking aloud to the baby. REALIZING, half unconsciously, that she would have to act quickly while her resolve was supported by anger, she set the baby down in his crib, brought out a couple of suitcases and started to pack. She was interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell, and hastily dabbing a bit of powder over the tell-tale streaks on her face, she picked up the baby and went to the door. She drew a quick sigh of relief when she saw that it was Sister Mortensen, the visiting teacher. She was such a pleasant, understanding soul. Just the sort of person to whom she could tell her troubles if she knew her a little better or if this were the sort of thing that she could tell to anyone. "Do come in," she said, opening the door, and while her guest was being seated she smoothed the baby's clothing and her own feelings at the same time. "I love to come here," said Sister Mortensen, sinking down into a large chair. "It's such a delightful room. I believe you said that you were thinking of buying the house." "Yes we were thinking of it," replied Daphne, a bit unsteadily. "But I'm afraid we've changed our minds " now "Oh, dear! I do hope that you aren't going to move away," exclaimed Aline. "I'd be terribly sorry to lose you from my district. It's such a pleasure to know a fine, normal young family like yours in these days of change and divorce." "Yes," agreed Daphne hesitantly, "there is more divorce now than in your day, but perhaps times are different perhaps there is more reason for it now." "Bosh, child, times are no different and people are no different. I guess there've been mighty few couples that it didn't take a lot of stamina and forgiveness and just plain intestinal fortitude to stick a marriage out what with _ taxes, measles and plumbing repairs always cropping up at the wrong time." "But not you, I'll bet," ventured Daphne with a smile. "You look so good-natured and even-tempered that I imagine an'. Earthquake wouldn't upset you." "Yet, even I ran home to my mother once," she returned with a chuckle. "That is, I went part way before I realized how silly I was behaving and turned back. And it was all on account of a sick dog that Henry brought home and was nursing on my best satin living room pillow. I still want to laugh when I THE BEST LITTLE SHRUB 195

PATTERN Eleanor Welch Schow Father, the world is filled with pain and woe. By night the terror walks; The hearts of men wax cold; the arrow flies By day; gaunt hunger stalks The weak and poor. The while, in this blest land, Laden, the orchards bend. While apples, red and gold, and purple plums In gorgeous colors blend With grasses green, like orient carpets spread Upon the earth. Yet we Hoard and are loth to heed the orphan's cry. Drift, and are slow to see Their need. Father, God, show us, we pray. The path to life eternal, the straight way. PATTERN   197 II Over a hundred years ago, a Prophet called A small assembly, gathered in Christ's name To do the deeds of loving charity That everyone must do who dares to claim Christ as a brother. He revealed to them A plan, a call to women to unite In loving kindliness and sisterhood To help the erring find the path of right. This way they passed along the stretch of years And grew in strength and knowledge every day; They blazed a trail through suffering's wilderness And placed their pattern along the way. Today, one hundred thousand members march In strength of womanhood. This is no wraith Of something that has been; this sisterhood Has shown the world one hundred years of faith! The hearts of these fail not in times of stress. But bravely show the weak the way to cope With sin; they nurse the sick and aid the poor. Supported by one hundred years of hope. The lamps of loving kindness ever burn Behind them on the trail with clarity. To show the path their steady feet have trod. Throughout a century of charity. Ill Dear God, forgive the selfish ones who hoard their food While hungry children cry; Forgive the petty stores of pretty silks, When men must chill and die. Help us, as they, along the ways of want To let our light so shine That all may see and glorify thy name! May we true Christians be; Give us the eyes to see, the will to show Unfailing charity. To leave for all who follow through the strife This pattern along our path of life.  197 And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER 10 (Conclusion ) THE spring days floated by as lightly as almond blossoms, each one filled with the perfume of growing things and the sweetness of spring breezes but each one bringing closer the day when Alec's and Jim's leave would end. Now Alec begrudged the hours that Delsa spent with Jeff Holden's children. "Don't go over there tonight, Delsa," he would beg. "I've such a few days left. Let's go riding up to our boulder." Sometimes she would listen to his pleading and would barely glance in on the children and then would hurry home, slip into her rodeo pants and plaid shirt, saddle and bridle Blue Star, and meet Alec. 'Then they'd ride, galloping along the road, cutting across the brush-covered flat, urging their horses up the steep canyon paths. Delsa liked these afternoons best of all, because while they were riding Alec looked almost completely happy. Of course, when they stopped, he was bound to look gloomily into the future, but often she could think of places to go that were far enough away so that they had no time for these pensive talks. At other times Delsa would have to stay at Jeff's till quite late, taking care of the youngsters, soothing Mrs. Reeder's ruffled spirits. Davy, though still a baby, was almost more than the tactless and inexperienced woman could handle. Page 198 Delsa understood what was wrong with the little boy no, not wrong with him but what caused him to act as he did. It was spring. The warm air invited the youngster to come outdoors and play. And he would answer that invitation, playing until he was too weary to mind what he was told, too utterly worn out to obey even the simplest com-- mands, and Mrs. Reeders commands were not always simple. Then again, the spring thaw made many fascinating mud puddles, and Davy could not keep his hands and feet out of the inviting mixture. 'T'his made extra work for his guardian, and extra work meant irritability. So, very often when Delsa went to the little house she found Davy in tears, and Mrs. Reeder scolding. It took time to bring order out of this chaos, and Delsa would forget that Alec was waiting impatiently while she bathed the little boy, gave him warm supper, and got him into bed. Trudy, still too young to make the mischief her brother made, and yet old enough to care for herself a little, was a different kind of worry to Delsa. Mrs. Reeder would put the baby in her pen and leave her alone for hours. Because she was a good baby and happy under most circumstances, she was left alone too much, and Delsa could think of hundreds of accidents that might happen to the child. The truth was, Delsa admitted to Alec one night when he was scolding her for neglecting him, the children AND FOR ETERNITY were becoming so dear to Delsa that she hated to be away from them. She might chafe at the responsibility that included keeping Mrs. Reeder happy, but the care of the children was sheer pleasure. BETWEEN Jeff and Delsa had risen an icy barrier of reserve. Jeff seldom came into the house while Delsa was there, but as it was planting time and he had his farm to care for as well as his job, his staying outside until after she left was excusable. At school he talked to her quietly, friendly enough when there was something that had to be said; the rest. Of the time he left her to herself. One afternoon Alec was waiting outside the schoolhouse when Delsa came out on her way to Jeff's. "Listen, Delsa," he said eagerly, "let's saddle the horses and ride down the valley this afternoon. Jim's been telling me about an old Indian that lives out about four miles and I want to see him. A real Indian! I don't know why no one ever told 22 me about him before! "Old Chickup!" laughed Delsa. "I guess no one thought he was worth telling about. We never even think of him." "Jim says he has a wonderful collection of authentic arrowheads. I do want to see them, Delsa. Let's go. You can show me the way." Delsa shook her head. "I'd love to, Alec, but I can't tonight. I promised Davy that if he'd be a good boy today I would show him how to make windmills like the first graders. I can't disappoint him." "You can disappoint me, though," 199 Alec said sulkily. 'Look, Delsa, you'll have those kids to tend as long as you want them. I think Jeff Holden has imposed on you long enough. He can hire someone to tend his kids for him and not tie you down this way all the time. Tell him you're not coming tonight." "Tt isn't Jeff's fault that I go over there, Alec," Delsa said soberly. "I really think Jeff would be glad if I didn't have to come, but I do have to. He can't get anyone else. You know for yourself how busy everyone is. "Don't I, though!" grumbled Alec, and added angrily, "If I could have found anyone else to show me, I wouldn't have bothered you, knowing that you'd rather play nursemaid." "You're being childish, Alec," Delsa said quietly. "I've really got pe) to hurry! "Well, hurry then; nothing's stopping you!" he answered shortly, and turned and walked swiftly away. Delsa felt as if he had actually slapped her, and her face burned with anger and resentment and shame as she ran down the road to Jeff's house. Davy hadn't been a good boy, she found when she entered the house, and Mrs. Reeder, exasperated beyond her forbearance, had taken matters into her own hands. Delsa found Davy sobbing as if his heart would break and when she went to pick him up she cried out in anger and surprise. He was tied to the table leg with a short length of rope  tied so tightly that the rope cut into his fat little middle, obviously hurting him. Delsa's hands were shaking as she 200 undid the rope, and, with the child in her arms, went to the kitchen to face Mrs. Reeder. D=ELS4: was so angry that she took no pains to hide her feeling, and Mrs. Reeder, evidently chagrined at the justice of Delsa's complaint, took refuge in her old challenge. "You ain't my boss, Miss Delsa, and you can't talk to me that way. I got along all right with Jeff till you came buttin' in, and I don't aim to stand and listen to you any longer. I'm quitting!" She grabbed her shawl from its peg and threw it over her head and walked majestically out of the house. Delsa sat down in the kitchen rocker and held Davy close. She had butted in. And now she had lost Jeff's only help. Well, there was nothing she could do about it just yet, though she would have to find a way to make things right later. She comforted Davy and picked up Trudy from her play pen to find the baby wet and cold and unhappy. Delsa set to work in her usual brisk way and almost forgot her anger at Mrs. Reeder and at Alec as she held the tiny body close and whispered _ comforting words to the whimpering child. She was so busy that when she heard the door open she thought only that Jeff had come in. She started in surprise when she heard Alec's voice, "Delsa, I'm sorry. I've come to apologize." "That's all right, Alec," Delsa said. "I suppose you do think it's unnecessary for me to put so much time in over here, but if you only knew the truth of it! If you only knew Mrs. Reeder!" Alec came across the room, and Delsa was so absorbed in her task that she didn't think how strange it was for the marine to be using Jeff's house so freely. "Where's Jeff?" Alec asked, and Delsa said without looking up, "He's outside, plowing, I guess. I hardly ever see him," she added, scarcely knowing she did so. Delsa put the last spoonful of mush into Trudy's mouth, wiped the baby's face and hands on a damp napkin, untied her bib, and sat back in the low rocker to cuddle the little girl for a moment or two before putting her into her crib. Alec stood above her, looking down, smiling in a queer sort of way. "You look like a madonna, sitting there, Delsa," he said huskily. Delsa laughed. "T don't feel much like one. I have been so angry I've scared Mrs. Reeder clear away, and I'm afraid it's for good." She rose and carried Trudy into the bedroom and laid her down gently. "Go to sleepy-bye, darling," she whispered, and turned to leave the room. Alec had followed Delsa in, and now he said, putting his arms about her, "Delsa, darling, now the kid's asleep, you can break away, can't you?" Delsa drew back sharply, saying, "Don't, Alec!" He looked at her and anger began to burn in his eyes again. '"What's the matter?" he asked gruffly. "What's so horrible about me putting my arms around you? I've done it often enough, haven't I?  AND FOR ETERNITY DELSA had been surprised at her own reaction. She had never before felt the dislike toward Alec that she felt at that moment. It was almost as if he had asked her to be unfaithful..... Delsa caught her breath at the thought that had sprung into her mind. She looked up at Alec and the wonder of her discovery gave a special glow to her eyes. "Delsa!" he cried, forgetting his anger in the radiance of that look. "Please go, Alec!" she said, and there was such finality about the request that Alec turned slowly, unquestioningly, and left the house. Delsa went into the kitchen. She wanted to sing and dance. She caught Davy up from the chair where he had been busy making his pinwheel, and held him close, kissing him. Then she set him down again, took Mrs. Reeder's abandoned apron from the nail behind the door and set to work to get Jeff's and Davy's supper. Davy laughed in delight at her. "You look funny in that apron!" he said. 'You look like a a ",, he couldn't think of a word. "A good old witch!" Delsa said, laughing back at him. "A good old witch that's going to get supper now for Davy and his daddy. Do you want to help, Davy?" It was growing dark in the kitchen and Delsa lighted the kerosene lamp, smiling to think that Jeff's house was so old-fashioned. Then she remembered that it was off the main line and she thought, as soon as the war's over, he can have a line run up here, I guess. Davy was putting the knives and forks on the table and Delsa was at 201 the stove with her back to the door when Jeff came in. She heard the door shut and turned, but she was in the shadow and Jeff hardly looked at her. Davy ran to his father. "Daddy! Daddy!" he cried, "Aunt Delsa's here. She's getting supper! I'm helping her!" Jeff turned then, and looked at Delsa, as she stood there in front of the stove with Mrs. Reeder's apron almost hiding her. "Delsa!" he said "What's the matter? Where's Mrs. Reeder? Delsa thought his voice was harsh, and her own voice caught a little as she went toward him. "Oh, Jeff! I'm so sorry! But I got angry at Mrs. Reeder and she left for good, I'm afraid." Jeff looked at her blankly. "I ll help, Jeff, until she comes back or we find someone else. That's why I stayed tonight to get your supper. It's all ready." She was trying to appear nonchalant, calm, but there was a strange radiance in her heart. Jeff turned without a word and went into the bathroom to wash. When he came out, Delsa was leaning over Davy, putting some hot scrambled eggs onto his plate. She straightened up, the serving dish still in her hands. Jeff stood just inside the doorway. He looked at her with such a strange intensity that Delsa set down the dish she was holding and went across the room and stood in front of him. "Delsa," Jeff said quietly, "I appreciate all you have done. But you had better go now." His voice broke suddenly. "I can't bear to have you here like this and not " 202 SUDDENLY his arms went around her and he was holding her tight against him. He bent his head, pressing his lips against her hair. "Delsa! Delsa! I love you so! I can't bear to have you near me and know that you do not love me!" Delsa lifted her face to his and the same wonder that had dazzled Alec an hour before now shone out, unafraid. "But I do love you, Jeff! Oh, I do!" Jeff's arms dropped to his sides and he leaned back against the door frame, as if he needed some support to steady him in what he was going to do.  "No, Delsa," he said firmly, "you don't love me. You feel sorry for me, maybe, and I know you love the children but not me!" Delsa put her hands 6n his shoulder, lifted herself on tiptoe, her lips raised. "Kiss me, Jeff! Kiss me, and you'll know that I love you truly, deeply, as a woman should love the man she marries." Unbelief stood stark in his eyes as he whispered, "You don't mean  you can't mean " "Jeff, listen. You need so much convincing. Alec was here a little while ago. He put his arms about me, here in your house, and I felt so alarmed I thought to myself, it is just as if he had asked me to be unfaithful to my husband because I was thinking of you, Jeff, though I didn't know it. I do want to marry you, Jeff I've loved you so long only I didn't know it, Jeff! I didn't know it!" Jeff didn't need any more convincing. His arms went close around her, he kissed her uptumed face and she answered his kisses and he knew then that her whole heart was his. And Delsa, standing in the circle of his arms, feeling Jeff's kisses, was at last content. Gone were her doubts and fears, her anxiety over what others might say or think. There was only Jeff Jeff and the babies, and later, of course, other babies of her own. This was what she wanted, above everything else in life and in eternity. Her hands went to Jeff's head, felt the soft, thick hair, pressed his head down toward her. Her lips were on his. They were oblivious to everything but this moment of surrender. Then Davy ruthlessly startled them, crying, "Supper's getting cold, Aunt Delsa! Come 'n eat!" Laughing, hand in hand, Delsa and Jeff went to the table and sat down in the circle of light from the little lamp.   CALL OF SPRING Beatrice K. Ekman Over the sodden fields, the March winds blow, And dormant seeds within the wet, cold sod, Long under cover of the winter's snow, Stir, as the warm sun sends its rays abroad. Soon now we'll hear again the sweet refrain Of mourning doves' soft cooing in the lane. _ OFS. Lady-in Waiting Marguerite J. Griffin HE little old lady was so small T and slight that she hardly made a swell in the bed cover. I wondered what I would say to her, meeting her for the first time this way. Her granddaughter whom I was visiting would not let me leave until. I had seen her. "For she will not be with us long, you know. She is very old, almost ninety-five. She isn't sick. Her body is just wearing out, becoming weaker and weaker. There isn't much for her to do, just waiting like this, and she has always loved people. Seeing you will brighten her whole day." This suggestion did not make me happy. I dreaded going into her room. I had always thought old age at best was a tragic time of life. And now to meet a human being who was just waiting for her mechanism to stop functioning, who was waiting for death to walk in at her door  But there was nothing I could do. I couldn't refuse if I might brighten one last moment. But how? What should I say to her? I had worried needlessly. I realized that the moment I saw her bright brown eyes twinkle at me from the wrinkled parchment of her cheeks. They told me at once that within her frail body was a spirit very much alive and alert. Her hands upon the counterpane were almost as white as the cover, and transparent so that the blue veins were plainly visible. Her hair was white like soft wavy strands of silk, a little scanty, but gently circling her face. She patted the locks in place as her bright eyes looked up at me eagerly. A smile scattered the wrinkles into new places but filled her countenance with a warm glow. "Sit down, my dear." Her voice was a little thin and tremulous. "I'm so pleased to meet you. You look so full of life. I bet you have children to care for." "Yes, three of them. But sometimes I don't feel so full of life." "They are wearisome, the little ones. But it's the happiest time of your life. Still, I don't know. All of life is good. I've seen a lot of it, too, my dear. And there's nothing quite like grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, and even great-greatgrandchildren. Oh, I'm very old, you know. I've seen a lot of things, a lot of change." Her voice faded away as if her thoughts were traveling faster than she had the power of speech to convey them. Then suddenly she started on another subject. "Jenny," she said to her granddaughter, "show the lady my new dress." A new dress at her age, in her bedridden condition? It was fantastic. Was there vanity still left, after all these years, in this little gnarled creature? Jenny brought it as if there were nothing unusual in the request. It was white silk crepe, dainty with lace. I know astonishment was on my Page 203 204 face, for the old lady said: "It's my burial gown, you know. And ['ll be wearing it soon." THE words were so gentle I couldn't gasp, but my heart was beating fast. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen. A beautiful gown like a bride's, and the little old lady positively anticipating the wearing of it. "Show her the rest, Jenny. The slip and the stockings. "You seem surprised. Maybe you hadn't thought the resurrection would be such a practical affair, but it will. There is no death really, only a change, a separation. The spirit leaves the body until the morning of resurrection." I could see why she could be so calm with a philosophy like that. I could see why her granddaughter was so sweet, so patient in her attentions toward the old lady. "It is a beautiful belief," I said. "Not a belief, my dear, but a truth." Her words were calm and quiet. She was not filled with the fire of a fanatic, but she was sure of her convictions. Besides, I didn't want to argue with her. I envied her peace of mind, her assurance. "It's a wonderful story, the story of man," she went on. "It's the story of change and progression, and we must be ready for each new thing. We lived before we came to this world, you know. Before this world was built. Our spirits were sons and daughters of God our eternal Father, and we lived with him." There was a soft glow on her face. Her eyes were mellow almost as if the vision were before them, or, as if being so close to death, to returning from whence she came, she caught the gleam and could remember. Then she looked at me quickly, as if sensing my thoughts. "It's all in the Bible, you know. It's not something I've made up. It's there, but the world tries to explain it away. Man thinks he is so great and, being a son of God, he does have a noble heritage. But can he hope to understand the business of our Heavenly Father any more than a child can understand the works of his earthly father? A toddler cannot comprehend how his mother makes cookies, but he accepts them, none the less, and munches upon them happily. So should we eat of the Bread of Life. So should we accept it, without worrying about how it will be accomplished. God has spoken. That should be enough. Jenny, hand me my Bible and my glasses." HAT! Could this little shrunken creature still use her bright eyes to read? What a blessing when she loved the Book so much! You could tell the gentle way she handled its worn pages. You could tell she had spent a lifetime reading it, for she found her passages with ease. "Listen to the words of the Lord to Job: "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare if thou hast understanding.' " Her sharp eyes peered at me over the spectacles as if she were challenging me to answer. "When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy,' we were there LADY-IN-WAITING and we were that glad over the earth the Lord was building for us." She closed her book and removed her glasses. "But time is short, my dear. We are born, we live and grow, and just as we reach our prime, when our mental powers are at their best, our bodies wither, wane and die. It is as Paul says." And now she was quoting her scripture from memory. If there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen.... And if Christ be not risen, then is your faith vain.... If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept..... For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death..... Then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? I was speechless. I, who had come in to brighten an old lady's moment, 205 had found it was she who had so much to give. She misinterpreted my silence. "But I'm sorry. I've tired you with my preaching. You must forgive me." "Oh, no. I must thank you very much." For even then I knew I would never forget her. What a triumph to grow old so gracefully, and even in her weakness be a source of strength to all who came her way! When next I saw her, and it was not very long after, she lay in state, daintily gowned in the dress whose beauty was its purity of color, its simplicity of style. Every lock of her white hair was neatly in place. Her hands, unadorned save for a heavy gold wedding band, lay quiet and at rest. Death had softened her features as if it had been welcome. No bride ever looked more lovely. It was as if she slept ever so gently, just waiting for her Master's voice to bid her rise. Oa SPRINGTIME IN THE WEST Lydia Hall Bright spots of heaven shining through The petals of a blossomed tree, A greening field whence, throbbing, comes The lark's loud song of ecstasy; The changing crimson of a hill Agleam with rain and flowers bright, A well-loved river's wide expanse Reflecting shadows and the light; The scented fingers of the sage Upon the desert's sunburnt breast, The pulse of life and loveliness, And springtime comes again out West.

MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS (Continued) Finland District, European Mission HE following excerpts are from a recent report from Europe sent to Elder Thomas E. McKay: "The acting Mission President, Elder C. Fritz Johansson and Elder Claus A. Person from Malmo, accompanied by Sister Astrid Johansson, a representative from the Mission Relief Society Board, made a journey to Finland August 7, 1945. "Journeyings in Finland are at present very fatiguing on account of heavy railroad traffic, worn-out equipment, engines and cars being in repair, and facilities at hand being far below the needs. 'The crowding of cars forced our party to stand up one whole night. "However, to the good and faithful saints in Larsmo Branch, situated close to Jacobstad, it was a great joy when the travelers arrived August 10, at 5:28 a. M. A special meeting was held on Saturday, the 11th, under the direction of the acting mission president. The first Relief Society in Finland was organized. A glorious spirit reigned, and often our thoughts turned to the day when the first Relief Society in the world was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith. "The Spirit of God Like a Fire is Burning' was sung and prayer Page 206 was offered by Elder Claus A. Person, after which 'If the Way Be Full of Trial Weary Not' was sung. "Acting Mission President C. Fritz Johansson thereupon greeted the saints present and Sister Astrid Johansson spoke of her appreciation of the opportunity to come to Larsmo to assist in organizing a Relief Society. She invoked the guidance of the Lord upon all present and explained that the purpose of the Relief Society organization was to help and to serve the members and our fellow men and to disseminate light and sunshine in a dark and dismal world. "The following points were discussed: 1. The fundamental aims of the Society. 2. The proper organization, president, counselors, and secretary. 3. The duties of teachers. 4. Meeting regulations. 5- Manuals. 6. The use of the help fund. 7. Reports and yearly dues. 8. Dressing the dead. G. Unity of board members. 10. The slogan: 'And above all these things put on chanty, which is the bond of perfectness' (Coloss. 3:14) was read. "Sisters were thereupon appointed to the different offices in the organization they had just completed and NOTES FROM THE FIELD were set apart in the branch meeting the following day. All expressed their joy and appreciation for the privilege of working in the Lord's cause, knowing that if they sought God in prayer, he would assist them and the work would go forward. Elder Berg said this was such an organization as they had been longing for, and he appreciated the visit of the mission authorities. "Be Ever Glad, Ye Daughters of Zion' was sung by Sisters Viola and Inga Ronnkvist, Vera Numan, and Georgina Back. Elder Claus A. Person spoke on the work of the Relief Society, a labor of love which will be written in the Book of Life. "Acting Mission President C. Fritz Johansson was the final speaker. He referred to the important event when. The Prophet Joseph Smith in the name of the Lord turned the key for this Society. Brother Johansson wished the sisters success in their work. The meeting closed with singing 'O Lord, Let Me Come to Zion's Land' and the benediction was pronounced by Elder J. Viktor Berg. All felt that the spirit of God was present in rich abundance and our hearts were filled with thanks to God for our membership in his Church. Besides the authorities from Sweden, those present were: Branch President J. Viktor Berg and the First Counselor Anselm H. Stromberg. The following were appointed to preside over the Relief Society: Sister Anna Stromberg, President; Sisters Johanna Soderholm and Inez Ikalainen, First. And Second Counselors, respectively; Viola Ronnkvist, Secretary-Treasurer; Inga Ronnkvist, Assistant Secretary; Sisters Georgina Back and Inez Ikalainen to act as teachers in Jacobstad 207 and Sisters Lena Renlund and Viola Ronnkvist to act as teachers in Larsmo." North Central States Mission ANN J. KILLPACK, President of the North Central States Mission, reports a mothers' and daughters' banquet, a social, and an old folks' party: MOTHERS' AND DAUGHTERS' BANQUET BILLINGS BRANCH "As a fitting climax for the year's Relief Society activities, sisters of the Billings Branch met together May 29, 1945 at a mothers' and daughters' banquet at which more than a hundred were in attendance. One of the oldest mothers present was Sister Mercy Elery who was a convert to the Church four years ago. This dear sister is very faithful in Church activity and many times has expressed her joy and gratitude for having been privileged to live long enough to find the true Church of Christ. She is now making plans to go to the temple to take out endowments. "Relief Society officers, Lucy Call Taylor, President; Johanna Sanderson, First Counselor; Edna B. Collins, Second Counselor; and Mary Grebe, Secretary, feel very grateful for the fine spirit of co-operation manifest among class leaders and fellow members. A great deal has been accomplished through this combined co-operation of the sisters. Visiting teachers have been very active and have awakened active participation among a large percentage of the branch membership. A_ Singing Mothers' group is very active and has contributed much toward musical entertainment, and the branch organization attained placement on the honor roll of The BILLINGS (MONTANA) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY North Central States Mission, Mothers' and Daughters' Banquet Photograph submitted by Ann J. Killpack, President, North Central States Mission Relief Societies. All of this has been accomplished through combined effort and co-operation which is the spirit of all true Latter-day Saint women." MOTHERS' AND DAUGHTERS' SOCIAL "The ladies of the Minneapolis Branch Relief Society entertained at a mothers' and daughters' social Wednesday, June 27, 1945. An invitation to attend was also graciously extended to the fathers and sons. The crowd was delightfully entertained by a program of poetry, dancing and music. Later they re tired to the recreation room where a tasty luncheon was served, and some danced to polka music. This was especially fitting as most of the members are from Scandinavian countries. "This social terminates what has been a very successful year of Relief Society activities. The sisters are especially proud of a rummage sale which they recently held. This sale netted them a profit of $103.84. All of the goods sold was donated by the sisters in the branch. A willingness to serve is manifest by all, and this is the true spirit of Relief Society work." OLD FOLKS' PARTY MINNEAPOLIS BRANCH "The ladies of the Minneapolis NOTES FROM THE FIELD Branch who were over sixty years of age met together at the North Central States Mission Home, March 22, 1945, for an afternoon of renewing friendships with sisters in the gospel. Ten of the thirteen women in attendance were converts. Most of them had heard the gospel in foreign lands and had given up friends, family, and all they held dear there to join the Church and come to the land of Zion, yet none of them felt that the sacrifice was too great, for through the gospel, they have learned to know real joy. They are happy in the knowledge that they have found the true Church of Christ. These sisters have been very faithful in Relief Society and other auxiliary work and are very regular in their attendance RES Sg OM... Fl 209 when the weather and their health permit.

Ellsworth said, "The hall is not a church. The meetings held in it seem to be just group meetings. All are determined, as soon as the priority is lifted, to have money ready to do something toward their own church building. "The sisters of the Salinas Branch gave a dinner, charging $5.00 a plate, and they were enabled to clear $215. During the summer months they are having a luncheon at each other's homes, taking their husbands and whoever else will join them, charging them fifty cents each and the other day they cleared $40."

We protest earnestly and with determination. We protest existing policies which encourage the consumption of liquor, with all the far-reaching consequences of that consumption. We protest the expansion of the liquor traffic and its freedom from the reasonable restrictions which would contribute to reconversion. We protest the use of thousands of tons of raw materials in making intoxicants.  Deets Picket, from The Voice, December 1945. Ze Work Meeting  Save Those Precious Scraps DON'T throw away your tiny print scraps until you have seen this quilt pattern," says Sister Ivie H. Jones, Relief Society President of the Spanish American Mission. "Whether it be called a 'String Quilt Block,' because it uses those long, narrow wedge-like strings from the side of skirt gores, etc., or whether it be called "The Scrap Bag,' "The Four Point Star,' or 'Economy Quilt Block,' it is a very practical way to use those tiny, irregular scraps that are too precious to throw away and yet too small to cut up into other types of quilt blocks. In fact, the smaller and more irregular the scraps, the prettier the finished quilt will be. It really might be called the 'Prism,' for the octagon wheel, made of the print scraps, looks pretty much like a prism of different shapes, sizes, and colors. "Making this quilt is especially suitable as a Relief Society project, since the sisters can work on the blocks at home and be assured that they will all be the same size when finished, and that is quite an item. But it is like seeing the Carlsbad Caverns or the Grand Canyon. No one can properly explain its beauty. You'll just have to see it for yourself." Materials Needed: Sufficient wrapping paper to cut forty squares, 1314x1314". (Newspaper is not satisfactory. ) Two yards plain colored material or two dyed flour sacks. However, the pattern adjusts itself nicely to any material on hand. Two yards will make strips 2" wide. 114 yards makes strips 114" wide, etc. Two feed or flour sacks (or mulsin) for the stars.

MARCH PROMISES Aileen M. Overfelt March winds are blowing, High, clear winds of spring, Mysterious with promise  Adventure on the wing. Promise of a primrose Blooming on a hill, Promise of an orchard Filled with robin's trill. Best of all, the promise In a woman's heart, To greet a man's returning From a foreign port. Voices in the high wind, Blow across the sea, Take this message to my love, "I will wait for thee."
