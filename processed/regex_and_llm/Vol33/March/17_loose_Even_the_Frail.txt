Even the Frail Christie Lund Coles RITA BERNSTROM looked through the open window and knew that this was the hardest time of day to bear this hour between light and darkness when the earth and sky seemed luminous, bell like in their clarity. It was as if every sight and sound might break the heart the gilt of the sun sifting through the window, the cool, dark shadow of the lilac bush across the foot of the bed. She could hear the neighbor women clanging kitchen utensils as they Prepared the evening meal. She could hear the shouts of children, the slide of their roller skates. She could even hear the neighbor women clanging kitchen utensils as they prepared the evening meal. She could hear the shouts of children, the slide of their roller skates. She could even hear the grunt of the of the rope as two children "pumped" each other in the back-yard swing. Men were coming home from work, dogs were barking, running after the occasional car that passed on the quiet street, sending the dust spiraling upward. She closed her eyes, listened as the radio played softly an old tune that swept over her in waves of light and darkness, waves of memories that were gay and tender. She was in a pink tulle dress, leaning backward in Brock's arms, laughing, saying, "You wouldn't fool me, would you, Mister?" dancing, whirling. Brock was smiling his one-sided smile, slowly, briefly, telling her seriously, "I'll never fool you, Rita. I love you too much. I'm going to malty you and we're going to have..." Page 186 She murmured softly, "Yes. I know. We're going to have a white house with green shutters... And five sons and maybe a daughter." His arm tightened about her and she felt his lips on her hair. And maybe a daughter! What casual words. Sons weren't so important, she supposed, not when the daughter was Eleanor Eleanor with her dark hair and blue eyes, blue as the sky at noon, like morning glories in the sun. She turned her head on the rumpled pillows. She was terribly tired. That was strange because one shouldn't get tired just lying, just thinking.... After a moment, she opened her eyes. She heard footsteps on the porch. Through the window she could see Mrs. Smith's tall, gaunt form, her bony fingers clutching a Stay sweater about her. Rita's heart began pounding. Instinctively, she reached over to close her door. She didn't want to see anyone. But Mrs. Smith gave a brief knock and walked in. She stood in the doorway, looking appraisingly about the room before she said, "Still down? Oh, dear..." There was no point in reminding Mrs. Smith that she would be down for a long time yet, so Rita only repeated the words, "Still down." Then, "Sit over there, won't you?" The other woman shook her head, "No, I haven't time. I've got to get Supper going. There's always so much to do. You're lucky to be able to lie here and test. Sometimes, I think if I gave up..." She sighed as if words could not tell of her affliction. 'Tm sorry," Rita said, "what does the Doctor think is wrong?" 'The Doctor . . . pshaw! What do they know ? "Once more she looked about the room and Rita was aware of the dust, of the bed's disorder. Then Mrs. Smith was leaving, say-ing, "If there's anything I can do ... let me know." "RITA smiled ironically, closed her eyes. Her weariness was alive with a sudden, gnawing unhappiness. She wanted to weep, but there were no tears, not any more. Why did that woman come, why did anyone come, with their curious eyes. She wanted to be alone, to shut her door, to wait here in the stillness where even pain wasn't as real as the figures moving in her mind, the bits of poetry. Emily Dickinson had said, "I measure every grief I meet with analytic eyes. I wonder if it weighs like mine or has an easier size ..." She heard Eleanor and her friend coming in at the back door. For a moment she even resented that intrusion. She listened to them as they discussed a radio program of the night before. Eleanor was saying, "She said, 'Goodbye, goodbye Steve.' She was in love with him. Then she crashed.' " Suzanne, the other child, added, "Yes. She said 'Goodbye, goodbye Steve.' I don't get it . "'Now they were entering her room, bringing in the evening paper. They were so sweet, each emerging into long-legged little girlhood. Eleanor squeezed her tightly and asked, "Are you all right, Mommie? Is there anything you need?  Rita kissed her smooth, firm cheek, "Not a thing," she told her, remembering how each time her daughter went out to play she would place a glass of water beside her, some tissues, and her digitalis. She would say, "Now you won't need anything until I come back." Suzanne stood back smiling shyly. Rita was sorry she had even momentarily resented her coming in. There were no questions to be answered in a child's eyes, no doubt. Children took the world on faith. She reached out to the child and Suzanne came into her arms as naturally as vapor emerges into sun-light. "You're awful sweet," Suzanne said, squeezing her, "I love you." Eleanor looked puzzled as she asked her friend, "Why do you love my mother? I don't love yours." Suzanne only smiled, and Rita said, "I like her to love me." Then, "Shall I read you the funnies?" She knew that was the thing that had brought them in. And why not? Who would stop skating, swinging, just to ask how a sick person felt or if she wanted anything. Each of them curled up on the bed beside her while she read, but when she had finished she did not keep them there as she tried to do other nights, telling them Bible stories or little jokes. She was in no mood for talk. Her world had strangely become a dark snood, shut-ting out the reality of everything. And she didn't care. She didn't care. But Brock would be coming soon. He would come in, the dog jumping about his feet. He would put his lunch pail down on the kitchen sink, go into the bathroom, wash his hands, splash water over his face and dark hair, whistling as he did so. "Hello," he would say slowly, coming into her room, drawing the word out into almost three syllables. He would pick up the evening paper _where Eleanor had left it, glance at it, and finally, bend over and kiss her. Even after nine years of marriage it was not a perfunctory kiss. It was tender and warm and sometimes, she was sure, it said all the things, the "How are you, my dear? I hope you've had a good day," that he was too inarticulate to say. At times it hurt her that he didn't say more, ask more. Then she would remember one night when he took her in his arms and cried, brokenly, "Oh, I'm so sorry for you. So terribly sorry." She knew it was better this way. Neither saying what was in the mind, each pretending. And it wasn't hard to pretend when he was here, for something within her bubbled with warmth and elation... Especially on Sundays when he and Eleanor would prepare Sunday dinner, then bring it in on a gaily bedecked tray. Each would take credit for whatever was best, each would deny having made the lumpy gravy. OFTEN, when the dishes were washed, Eleanor would come in and they would play Chinese checkers. Brock would pretend complete interest in whatever he was doing in the living room but soon he would be drawn in, would ask with his slow, one-sided smile, "Do you think you can beat me?" "Oh, I daresay," she would assure him, smiling up into his eyes, watching him as he picked up the board, arranging the brightly colored marbles so they could all three play until she was tired and forced to sink further into the rumpled pillows. She knew she was lucky to have Brock, but there were times, like this, when she was overcome by a horrible, clawing ache. She resented this frail body with its great weariness, its swift heartbeats. She even resented him and his kindness. She didn't want him doing her work, having the neighbors pity him. She turned her head to the wall and let her eyes travel for the unnumbered time up the pink wall paper, trace the white flower upon it. Brock had papered a few months ago. He thought it would make lying here easier. But already there were smudges on it where Eleanor touched it when she crawled into bed with her after her daddy left in the morning. She sighed as she heard Brock's car in the driveway. Now, the game would go on. He would pretend he didn't mind having a wife who couldn't measure up to the name. She had been gay and _ vivacious when he had married her, though not as strong as some women because of an old heart ailment. But she had kept the house, taken care of things until after Eleanor's birth. Then, she had gradually grown more tired, less able to make her ener, teach... Until the collapse. She recalled the small, intent doctor telling her she would have to have complete rest for at least a year, maybe longer. She remembered telling Brock, "Some people in the world would make quick work of my kind of person. EVEN THE FRAIL They don't let them hang on and suffer." He had looked at her "Don't be silly." But it was true, and perhaps, it was better. Suddenly, she put her hands over her eyes as her mind's shutter opened on the picture of a little girl, her beautiful little daughter. Each day, almost each time she came into the house she called to her mother immediately after opening the door, called and waited. If there was no answer she called again, an urgency, a fear in her voice that, please God, should never have been there. Darkly, ROCK seemed slower in coming to her room. It seemed more of an effort for him to take his eyes from the paper and kiss her. And as he bent down, she saw new lines about his mouth, lines put there, no doubt, by worry and unhappiness. She asked him, through force of habit, "How is everything at the plant?" "Fine," he assured her, not noticing her preoccupation, the look in her eyes. Then, "what would you like to eat?" "It doesn't matter," she said quietly. It didn't matter. It would probably be the same as always, meat and potatoes, string beans or carrots, canned fruit from the basement. What would she like, really? Creamed chicken on toast, shrimp salad, something green and crisp and appetizing, something cool and light. He left her room and shortly afterwards she heard Gloria at the back door, Gloria Ross, the neighbor girl who came in on Saturdays and helped with the cleaning. "Hi" she greeted Brock now, "how'd you like me to come and help get supper?" "Fine," he assured her, "you said you would some time. I'm getting tired of my own cooking. Not that it's not good, mind you." Gloria laughed, "Oh, I'm sure it is delicious." She was soon rattlin pans in the small, bright kitchen, the kitchen Rita loved with its crisp white and red curtains, the huge bay window which caught both the morning and the afternoon sun. She had so loved working there, baking on cloudy days, ironing. They talked of the good weather, Gloria's school work. Then she squeeled, "Turn on the radio! Har. Ty James! And is he the stuff?" After a second she went on, "Or can Mrs. Bernstrom stand it?" "She doesn't mind," Brock assured her, stepping into the other room to snap the radio on. Ordinarily it wouldn't have bothered her, but tonight it seemed the jive music was pounding upon her. But she didn't speak of it. She reached over to close her door and as she did so, she could see into the kitchen, could see Gloria holding out her dress, doing a little dance step as she told Brock, "This is getting in the groove." ITA could see the smile on Brock's face, the youngness there that she hadn't seen in a long time, too long. The thought came to her and she couldn't get it out of her mind  that he might care for Gloria. After all, it could be. She was young and vivacious, all the things his wife had left behind. And she couldn't blame him. It didn't matter. She was in 190 a place apart from them, a place with a closed door between. She heard a car door close outside just as Brock and Gloria were taking out her dishes. Brock said, "I guess that's Peter. I met him yesterday and he said he was coming out." Rita brushed at her hair with fluttering hands, "Why didn't you tell me?" she asked. "I guess I never thought of it," he answered casually, "I'll let him in." Gloria hurriedly gathered up the paper on the bed saying, "Til fix these then beat it through the back door." As Gloria slipped away Rita heard the voice of her husband's brother. He was successful, immaculate, somewhat condescending. She knew where his sympathies lay. And why not? Why shouldn't he pity Brock with his nose to the grindstone, paying doctor bills, growing old before his time. Once more she wanted to close the door, but Brock was bringing him in, he was asking how she felt, saying cheerfully, "You're going to be all right." "Of course," she agreed. Course." Just like that! After a few more words the two men went out and she reached over and closed her door quietly. She wouldn't need to see him again since it was an agreement between her and her husband that when it was shut she did not want to be disturbed. She thought she could sleep, but sleep was for those who were at peace, those who were weary from work or play. She heard the two brothers step out onto the front porch. She heard "Of Eleanor talking to her dolls in her own room. The spring evening was sweet and still. Through the open window she could have heard the two men talking but she didn't listen, she didn't want to listen until she heard Brock say, "How is Erma?" Erma was Pete's wife. She was everything that Rita wasn't, "disgustingly healthy," she described herself. Impervious, and beautiful. Peter answered, "She's fine I imagine." Then, "I seldom see her. She's forever at this luncheon or that club." "War work, too, I suppose," Brock went on. She was amazed at the irony in Peters voice, "Erma? Don't be funny." Brock told him that she, Rita, had written many letters to soldiers, and knit a couple of sweaters. He was trying to justify her lying here, she thought. Peter said, "She doesn't look too well. She's lucky to have you." Her husband didn't speak and she held her breath as she waited. She heard him laugh shortly before he disagreed, "Oh, I don't know." He seemed to be trying to find words and she thought: Now, all the bitterness and tiredness and resentment will come out. After a moment, he said, "No, Peter, she's not especially lucky. I'm the lucky one. She's so darn sweet. She has taught me a lot of things." After a moment, he went on hesitantly, "You know, Pete, if we were all strong we wouldn't ever need fight a defensive war. In many countries they 'take care' of the weak, put them out of the way, here, we fight for them, for the right of EVEN THE FRAIL even the frail to live and do good in their own way. Who knows, it may be a farther-reaching good than that of the strong." Suddenly, her nails dug into the flesh of her palms, they were wet with perspiration. Peter laughed good-naturedly, almost enviously, "Then I suppose you are both mighty lucky." Brock agreed, "Yes. I think we're ALL mighty lucky. Just living in America is really something." There was no tiredness in his 191 voice, no bitterness, just the honest goodness that was Brock. He wasn't sorry for her. He thought she was lucky, AND SHE WAS. She was. She turned her face to the pink wallpaper and lay very still looking at it, at the gray smudges. Tears, good, healing tears filled her eyes, spilled on her cheek. She reached over to the closed door, opened it wide, calling as she did so, "Eleanor, darling, don't you want to come in and say your prayer by my bed?"
