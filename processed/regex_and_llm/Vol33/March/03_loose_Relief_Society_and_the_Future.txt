Relief Society and the Future Leah D. Widtsoe FAMILY life is best lived when man and wife form a real partnership, each pulling an equal share of the load and sharing equally in responsibility. It would be unfair and results would be far from happy if the man received most of the advantages and possessed any great gift from which his life partner were excluded. This is especially the case if the exclusion is simply because she is a woman. A Glimpse Into the Past When the true Church of Christ was restored through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the equal rights of men and women on earth and before God were assured. From the first, women were asked to exercise their religious franchise, the same as were the male members. Their votes in sustaining officers were accepted as were men's, and that practice continues to this day. 'The great and primal right of free agency belongs to all God's children to his daughters as well as to his sons. In order to give women greater opportunities for progress, the Relief Society was organized through inspiration by the Prophet Joseph Smith on March 17, 1842. It was organized to "purge out iniquity" from their midst, but always to be "armed with mercy" in pursuance of their righteous labors. And, while the purpose which caused the sisters to want an organization was the desire to aid the poor and needy, yet the Prophet greatly enlarged its scope by declaring: "The Society is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls." 'This incentive should stimulate the women of the Church to be active in this Society and to carry on incessantly. When the priesthood was restored, it was bestowed on all the righteous male members of the Church, but the blessings accruing therefrom are for the benefit of all Church members, men, women, and children. This is a wise provision, for as the mothers of men, potential or actual, women have a calling which is so time-and-energy consuming that added duties would be burdensome. In one of the Prophet's instructive discourses to the sisters, "he spoke of delivering the keys of the Priesthood to the Church, and said that the faithful members of the Relief Society should receive them in connection with their husbands, that the Saints whose integrity has been tried and proved faithful, might know how to ask the Lord and. Receive an answer" (D. H. C. Vol. IV, page 604). The sisters should accept this as a challenge to be wise and circumspect, and truly in harmony with God's laws and ordinances, or they may lose this precious gift. At another time the Prophet stated to the sisters: "I now turn the key in your behalf, in the name of the Lord, and this society shall rejoice, and knowledge and _intelligence shall flow down from this Page 147 148 time henceforth." This glorious promise is for us today, as well as for the women of the past, and should stimulate every woman in this Church to participate in the activities of Relief Society. The Present Speaks That the women of the Church have profited and do appreciate these blessings is proven by the continual growth of the Society. From the original eighteen members at the organization meeting, it has grown to a membership of over 102,000, with active groups in most of the civilized countries of the world today. The program includes the provision for the mental and spiritual growth of the members, as well as for the care of the poor or ill or needy in any way. The promise of the Founder is being fulfilled! But growth and Church membership demand progress. What of the Future? And now to us all today comes the challenge of the Future! What may we, the members of Relief Society do to help heal our sick and war-torn world? How it needs the administrations of the Great Physician, the Father of us all! I often wonder whether the women of the world, and especially of this Church, really understand the great power that they possess. If every mother were to impress upon her young and growing child that to love is so much more fun than to hate, that men are essentially good and are intended to love righteousness, and that everyone's difficulty may be settled by finding out what is right and then doing it if that could be done, then wars would be impossible. The mother has this definite responsibility, because through nature it is she who gives birth to and nurtures the child most closely during his early formative years, when his character for his entire future life is being formed. There are two great truths with vast implications that all should understand: (1) all great causes have small beginnings; (2) a chain is no stronger than its weakest link. The mightiest rivers on earth have their beginnings hundreds of miles away in the tiniest trickle from a melting snowbank. Many of these "trickles" unite to form a rivulet, many rivulets make a stream, the streams make a river, and many rivers uniting form the mighty Mississippi, Amazon, and Volga rivers, with their majestic power. Similarly there is an ultimate beginning of every war, and it is in the homes in which the children of men are reared in your home and mine and all the countless homes of earth. The individual home may be likened to the tiny trickle which begins the mighty river. If a child is loved and cared for and understood from infancy, and all his problems met with fairness and justice by wise parents, he grows up with faith in his playmates and later in his fellow men, prepared to expect and to give justice and mercy 'in all his dealings in later life. These are undoubtedly the "men (and women) of good will" of whom the angels sang on the first Christmas morn when they promised peace! On the other hand, if a busy, distracted, selfish, untrained, wrongly brought-up mother, or father, treats the child with unfairness, punishes him unjustly (as the child feels), RELIEF SOCIETY AND THE FUTURE | and fails to give time and patience and love enough to understand him and his problems, even though they think they love him, then this child is very likely to grow to maturity feeling that the world is unjust, that evil is everywhere. He is sure to feel that only he succeeds who looks out for himself, and it does not matter what happens to anyone else so long as he gets what he wants. Such a child grows to maturity with a burning determination to "get even," to get revenge for the wrongs he feels were innocently forced upon him. That is but human. Of such children grow the future overlords, dictators, and all their kind who think might is right, and any means justify getting the power to rule others. War will cease only when men learn from infancy the power of love, justice, and the true worth of all God's children on earth, with their right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." The first and greatest teachers of these noble truths are the mothers of men; they can be ingrained into one's character in no other way. When the chain of world peace is forged, it can be no stronger than the men and women who have come from homes such as yours and mine with their determination, OT lack of it, to be truly "men of good will." to place on the shoulders of the mothers of men. Indeed, it is too big a job to be left to chance. Motherhood is indeed and should be the greatest of all professions, for its results are far-reaching and 149 tremendously important. Yet this profession is practically the only one today which is ignored, as such, by our schools, colleges, and universities. One must be trained for any and every other profession even for trimming fingernails of curling hair  and especially for the "fine art" (?) of killing one's fellow men, women, and children! The tremendous increase in juvenile delinquency and crime ls rightly laid, as first cause, to faulty or broken homes, and they are surely the result of ignorant and untrained mothers and fathers but especially mothers. Yet, what are we doing to make better mothers? Girls should learn the technique of homemaking. To trust to home training or instinct is not enough in too many cases it is negligible. The condition of the world today proves this to be true. This, then, may be one of the greatest opportunities for the active endeavor of every mother of Zion: to work for better motherhood in the Society and to demand special intensive training in homemaking and parenthood in all our schools, even in the grades for many girls do not reach high school or college.. This training should be as fundamental as the "Three R's." Its neglect can bring greater disaster to the entire human race. Our Relief Society program has included instruction for better motherhood and such training will be continued. Are we doing all we can in the Society,: n the communities, as in our homes, to inculcate justice, fairness, and nobility into the lives of our children and their friends? Are we making our convictions known so that our schools and other agencies will 150 provide training for parenthood and homemaking for every boy and girl in the land? If the hundred thousand voices of Relief Society are raised in any cause, they are sure to be heard. The second century of Relief Society will have many tasks for our willing hearts and hands, but surely this is one way of meeting the needs of the hour and extending our usefulness for world betterment. Our Heavenly Father will help us in this great task, if we ask him, and activate the truths he has given for our guidance in the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is but one way we may fulfill truly our destiny as members of this great God-given Relief Society!
