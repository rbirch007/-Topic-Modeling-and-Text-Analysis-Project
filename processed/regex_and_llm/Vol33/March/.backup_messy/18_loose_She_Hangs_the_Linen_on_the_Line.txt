SHE HANGS THE LINEN ON THE LINE Dott J. Sartori Here is snow impervious To March's melting weather. Here is white unsullied as An egret's flowing feather. Here, in intermittent drifts, In cities without number, Are hung the linens of the land, Companions of our slumber. Here will snow shine glacier-clean As long as there shall be A home and need, and one who smooths A pillow tirelessly.
