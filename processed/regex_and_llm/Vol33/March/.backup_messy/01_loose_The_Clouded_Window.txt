The Clouded Window Caroline Eyring Miner THERE was once a woman who called to her neighbor and said, "My dear, just look, if you will, at Sarah Brown's washing on the line. It is so grimy it's a disgrace to hang it out," and she peered through her window again at the line hung with damp clothes, as if to justify her remark. That glance, through her own soot-covered, dusty, and spotted window was the only possible justification for her cruel words. Outside, or viewed through shiny windows, Sarah Brown's clothes swung white as freshly fallen snow in the crisp morning breeze. Too often the windows of our souls are sooty and grimy with dirt so that they obscure the true state of affairs. I am thinking of the soot of envy, and jealousy, the grime of slander and gossip and alibi. My neighbor has succeeded in winning prizes on her canned vegetables and fruits at the county fair. I have seen her products and feel that mine are better and I have desired and coveted just such recognition as she has received. Looking through a clean window I would see things as they are. Her products, which she made a great effort to display, were really the best at the fair. I should be glad for her justified reward, but I am viewing the incident through a clouded window and so I am envious and jealous of her recognition. I slander her work and alibi my own position. Almost every moment of our lives is colored or discolored by the window through which we view it, or in other words by our individual point of view. I know a woman intimately who looks at the world through a rose-colored window. She is enthusiastic about everyone and everything. She is uncritical and each experience as it comes to her, whether objectively good or bad, is the very best thing that could have happened to her. What a delightful view she enjoys from her window. We are not all alike, though, and perhaps it is as well that we are not all looking at the world through tinted windows. The essential thing is that we see things as they are through clear windows and not distorted and sullied, through sooty and clouded ones. Page 172
