LATE MOTHERHOOD Eva Willes Wangsgaard She has waited long for this Marvel of maternal bliss; Joy illumining her face Wells from love as deep as space. Here is proof that love can wreathe A room till you can feel it breathe; Rapt with joy, she has not heard Our steps. Retreat, without a word. Let no movement nor mischance Startle moth-winged radiance.
