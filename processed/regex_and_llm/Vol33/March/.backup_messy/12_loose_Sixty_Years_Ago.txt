Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, March 1 and March 15, 1886 "For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE Rights OF THE WOMEN OF ALL Nations" WRITE TO ME VERY OFTEN Write to me very often, If you but send a line, For the ocean rolls between us, Yet your life seems linked to mine. I am tarrying with strangers, But when your letters come, My heart is high with rapture, For they speak of love and home.  Anonymous ee Re HOUSE-FURNISHING: In house-furnishing a little money and a good deal of taste go much farther than a little taste and a good deal of money. The first rule, and 4 most important one, is to go slowly. Learn what you want, and having decided this question, never accept anything else until all possible expedients are exhausted for procuring it. Do without until the moment of absolute necessity rather than accept unsatisfactory substitutes  Selected a CONVERSATION: One of the chief benefits of conversation is that each can learn that which his companion knows and he does not; but this benefit can come only to the modest and receptive mind. Most of the argument held by persons of opposite views is quite futile for the want of this mental condition. The object is not to find out the truth about the mooted subject, but to shine and to conquer. Neither party becomes wiser, neither is convinced. The humiliation of the one and the triumph of the other are alike fruitless. Editorial Note UTAH STAKE: Relief Society Conference, February 26, 1886. President John felt well in meeting with the sisters in conference once more and thought we were doing a good work. We know that this is the Kingdom of God, and feel that the Lord is blessing us here in Provo****Let us honor those who are called to preside over us and pray for them. We must learn to build up and not pull down. Let us cultivate a spirit of peace, for our strength lies in the power we have with God. O. Daniels, Secretary MISCELLANEOUS: Many a small man never ceases talking about small sacrifices he makes; but he is a great man who can sacrifice everything and say nothing. Let any man in middle life look over the list of those he has known and ask himself whether those have always succeeded best whose minds were most intent upon success. OUR CHILDREN: It is a great boon to the rising generation that the old custom of "telling ghost stories" and "witch stories" is pretty much abandoned. Pleasant and true stories are the best for the little ones to become interested in ****In connection with this subject, it may be observed how very important it is that little ones should be early taught to pray.
