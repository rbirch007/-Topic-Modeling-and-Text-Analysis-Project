MARCH PROMISES Aileen M. Overfelt March winds are blowing, High, clear winds of spring, Mysterious with promise  Adventure on the wing. Promise of a primrose Blooming on a hill, Promise of an orchard Filled with robin's trill. Best of all, the promise In a woman's heart, To greet a man's returning From a foreign port. Voices in the high wind, Blow across the sea, Take this message to my love, "I will wait for thee." Page 215 216 Welcome Moon Handicraft Gift
