An Open Door to Happiness Wilford D. Lee FROM the time that the boy first tastes great juicy apples from his father's orchard, and plays hide-and-seek in the gigantic sweet clover which grows between the trees, to the time that he comes into manhood, he becomes more and more convinced that God made this unusual world as a place to be enjoyed. Because the boy was raised on a farm he came in contact with nature early, and as far back as he can remember, these contacts have been pleasant. Moreover, the things which were pleasant when they were experienced have continued to give him joy when the experience itself is gone. It is interesting to step inside the boy's mind and find what is stored there to see how the sights and sounds and tastes and smells of natural life help to give the man happiness. His father was a beekeeper who placed his hives on the sunny southwest slopes of those low Idaho hills just east of the upper Snake River. When the spring came the boy was chosen, because of a special skill, to stay near the apiary and watch for swarms. The boy had learned to whistle, but not in the little girls' way, nor in the manner of the bird imitator. His whistle was a loud and lusty blast, a piercing sound which, on a clear day, could be heard half a mile away. What marvelous beauties he experienced on those first warm days of spring! He lay on his back with his hat over his eyes, there on the Page 162 sun-splashed hillside, soaking in the warmth which so long, through the winter months, had been denied. And even with his eyes shut, he could tell what was going on in the valley below him. Just a few rods away, the canal skirted the hill, and in the willows that fringed its banks, the red-winged blackbirds caroled their melodious harmony. In the silences, when they flew away, the boy could hear his father plowing in the field below the canal, the steady squeak of stretching leather, the click of singletrees, the musical tinkle of chains, the rhythmical stamp of the horses' hoofs as they thrust their shoulders into the creaking collars, the scrape of the plow as it grated upon a rock. IN the lull of the noontide, when the horses were in the stable, and the birds were resting in the shade, the smell of wild things crept into the silences like shy welcome creatures which were always present, yet unnoticed in the medley of sound. The sweet damp earth steamed in the warmth of the strengthening sun; the rotting vegetation sent up the smell of ripe fertility; the plowed field exuded into the breeze its own particular smell of new-turned earth. The snowdrops, the sweet william, the docks, and the little snowballs all hinted at perfumes which could not be really smelled without picking the flower. AN OPEN DOOR TO HAPPINESS The newly opened leaves of the willow and the poplar mixed the scent of their sticky sap with the smell of dandelions and apple blossoms which was brought to the hill by the giant-legged bees, But all of these perfumes were drenched and strengthened by the sage which dashed its tangy perfume on every puff of the south wind. Into the drowsiness, just when the boy was farthest away in a sleepy ecstasy, the sound of the bees rose in quick crescendo, singing with a high whining hum; then he sat up to find that the bees were swarming. They poured from the hive like water from a break in the canal. The boy leaped to his feet, and cupping his hands to his mouth, sent forth his shrillest blast again and again until his throat pained him. The sound streaked away, like a stream of light, to the house a quarter of a mile away. The father, coming to the door, waved, then started at a trot for the hill. When the lad saw that the father had heard, he turned, and dipping up water, from tubs prepared beforehand, flung it into the air among the circling bees. By the time the father got there, the bees were clustering on a Sage or willow bush while the man squatted unveiled, breathing hard from his run up the hill, and tried to find the queen. Failing in that, he took the box of frames which the boy had brought, and shook the bees into it. This was the spice of life which made existence interesting. And a lazy life it was, for, although the child helped to capture hundreds of swarms, he has yet to see the vanguard of one issuing from the hive. Always he was too busy lying on his back, looking up into the clear blue sky, preoccupied with seeing, and smelling, and tasting, and feeling the joyous excitations of nature. Never 163 until the swarm was a spiraling, circling cyclone of life, did the boy realize that the bees were swarming. With the declining sun, a chill crept into the air, and the child awoke from his reverie, it was then that his senses became as acute as pain. He rose and shook himself into wakefulness, and started for the house. As he moved along, the evening robins filled his ears with chirping, but through the gaps in their song, he heard the wind whizz through the dry stems of last year's grass. The shadows gathered in purple splotches in unexpected places; the western horizon, lit up with reds and golds, sent aloft long fingers of light as if in thankfulness to God for the perfect day. The hum of all living things as they gathered in peace for the night, the tang of willow bark on the lad's tongue as he crossed the canal to the house, the Caress of the south wind as it swept his cheek, all moved and thrilled him as he ended his day. AND so it is that we love nature, and get joy from all her sounds and smells and delicate hues. Who can resist the splashing loveliness of a mountain stream as it dashes along its bed? It is like a mischievous boy whose play is never ended. We love to sit so close that the roar of it is in Our ears, and the splash of its spray is On our faces. It is abundantly true that from the nature which is intensely smelled, and tasted, and felt, we get one of the purest types of happiness; and not only happiness, but truth as well, for poets, and musicians, and artists everywhere come to nature for their inspiration; and Philosophers and Prophets use her 164 every mood as proof for their principles of right. Many of the experiences in nature are either painful or ludicrous; yet as they pass into the background of the mind, they lose their sting and remain in Our memories as sweet Or beautiful events. The lad came to know about cows in some such way. All his life he had been fond of milk, and when the old white-faced cow went dry, which seemed to him entirely too often, he stood at the house and looked up to the canal where the animal stood knee-deep in clover placidly chewing her cud, the picture of patient contentment. And then she calved. What rejoicings there were when the nine milkings had been fed to the pigs! Then, one day an older sister and brother took the lad out to see the new-born calf. The cow, which had always been so mild and docile, was feeding in the field. How were they to know that she would object to the sister's red dress? With a snort and a bellow she charged! And only by flying like the wind, whisking the child between them, did the brother and the sister save him. They popped into the honey house and slammed the door just as the old cow lunged against it. She bellowed and pawed the earth until the father came and drove her away. In somewhat the same way, the children came to know the habit patterns of geese. Certainly they should have known better, for they all had helped to pick the feathers from the birds at molting time. Woe to the person who let go of a wing. With the knobs of his pinions the goose can strike a blow like a prize fighter. One spring the old gray goose laid her eggs in an overturned barrel. In the allotted time she brought out eight beautiful puffs of yellow down. How the children wanted to touch them as they followed their mother in military order to the water! One day the boy slipped up behind the old goose while she was feeding on the new green alfalfa, and caught a little gosling. Though he held it carefully, its cries brought the old goose charging. Such a beating fury hit his back and shoulders that he was knocked to the ground, where the old goose beat him and pulled his hair until the boy's mother, answering his screams, came and drove the old goose off and saved him from being completely gobbled up. It is said that happiness is dependent upon the possession of a certain amount of the physical comforts of life, such as food, clothing, shelter; yet it is surprising how many people have these things and yet are not happy. In fact, the overindulgence of the appetite in physical enjoyments is certain to bring weariness rather than the expected joy. The man who tastes lightly of the good things is the one who enjoys them most. With an appetite that is unsated, the person goes on through life, still enjoying, still experiencing keenly, still adding to the happiness which is already his. An appetite that is gorged, whether it be with food, or drink, or entertainment, can never give its owner a satisfying thrill of happiness. Thus, some of the most subtle experiences come from the stored images which, as Wordsworth says, "flash upon the inward eye, which is the bliss of solitude." The storing of the soul with beauty is the process by which real culture is accomplished. AN OPEN DOOR TO HAPPINESS The type of culture which grows from within is in abrupt contrast to the semi-polite veneer which can be, and often is, removed when the individual is away from the ones whom he wishes to impress. It is a type of inward training which makes "endless additions to itself..... Endless expansions to its posers..... Endless growth in wisdom and _ beauty." Such a culture is not having and resting, but growing and becoming. It is an idea of perfection which is totally at variance with the ideas of culture which a material and a mechanical civilization gives us. The time may come when materialistic people will completely satisfy their desire for things, for gadgets, for machines, and for new inventions. In that time when their desires are satisfied, when their appetites are surfeited with clothes, and automobiles, and houses, intelligent people will wake up to the fact that they have minds, and _ that, through the development of the mind, the greatest happiness can be achieved. 165 Yet the obtaining of happiness is a complex process, and cannot be completely accomplished with only one source. Joy is a stream which flows from many fountains, only one of which is the overflowing spring of stored-up beauty. Happiness comes also from the thrill of creation, whether that creation is a wicker basket or a Paradise Lost. And happiness comes from a sense of inner purity, a joyous oneness with God. The feeling of love for all the world steals in when sympathy replaces envy, when love replaces hate, when exquisite satisfaction follows a legitimate wish.
