Prelude to Spring Beatrice Rordame Parsons THE last tiny edges of snow had melted into small rivulets across the yard, and daffodils lifted tiny yellow, lavender, and pink heads among the last winter's leaves.
Gram Latimer and her young neighbor, Alicia Tremayne, who lived in the big, white farmhouse halfway down the road, stood on the porch of the old Latimer farmhouse and glanced eagerly towards the state highway.
Far off in the distance a yellow car moved against the horizon. Gram's voice quivered. "It's him, Lissa. It's Val. He's coming home at last."
Her fingers pulled the woolen shawl closer about her shoulders, though the early March sun was warm against her snow-white hair. Excitement showed in her features excitement and happiness, with just a tiny shadow of fear. She looked at the girl.
"Will . . . will he be changed, dear? It's been such a long time. It's been out of the army for eight months. And yet he hasn't been home."
A tiny pain suspended itself in Alicia's heart. Why hadn't Val come? What had happened? It had been a long time. Four years since he had gone away. So much had happened in between. The war. The wound in his hand. His engagement to Winnie. . . .
Almost as if she had read Alicia's thoughts, Gram said sharply, "She's coming with him she and her brother, Hank Carter, who has that band in town. Val wants to show her off."
The pain in Alicia's heart grew stronger. Once she had dreamed of Val as a girl dreams of the man she loves. But with his engagement to Winni she had wrapped those dreams in the tiniest corner of her heart. She spoke quietly. "I'm glad he's happy, Gram. He deserves to be."
Gram shook her head and her faded brown eyes were shrewd. "Val's a farm boy, no matter what high-falutin' notions he's got since the war. He belongs on the farm." Her voice died to a fraction of its tone and she whispered. "He's got to want to stay on the farm, Lissa."
Alicia knew what it meant to Gram to have Val back. She knew how hard it had been for the old lady all these years. She had done the best she could, but fallow land, unplanted fields and broken fences attested to her lack of help. Alicia tried not to see how shabby things were. She spoke almost fiercely. "Soon it will be beautiful. Right now everything's sort of . . . well, dark brown and . . . and ugly. But pretty soon the apple trees will be spreading a pink carpet over the orchard, and the gulls will be following the plow."
GRAM did not seem to hear her vehemence. The cab was turning into the long lane that led towards the house. As Alicia finished, it stopped at the white picket gate. Page 173 174 In another minute Val stepped out and Alicia's eyes shone in spite of her resolution not to show how much it meant to her to have him come home. ~ He looked the same, tall, wide-shouldered, with rumpled brown hair and laughing brown eyes very much like Gram's. He put out his left hand and helped Winni out, and Alicia's eyes filled with tears. His right hand hung stiff and useless at his side. The girl was beautiful in a tall, haughty way, with smooth dark hair rolled into a great chignon at her neck and blue eyes that examined everything carefully. Her brother, Hank, was round and cheerful, and he carried his violin case carelessly as he came up the walk. Winni called to him sharply, "Hank, do carry my bag! You know Val can't manage it and the little one, too." Dutifully, Hank turned and picked up the bag, but in spite of Val's smile, Alicia saw him wince. Then he was striding up the walk, and his left arm was holding his grandmother close against his side while he kissed her. "Gram, Gram, darling, it's good to see you." He kissed her again, then looked across her thin shoulder at the girl standing beside her. His eyes widened, then he began to laugh, as he offered his hand. "Is it really you, Lissa? I'd never have known you! Where are all those freckles, long legs and fiery hair?" He looked at her until she blushed furiously, and Winnie's cool voice asked, "Darling, aren't you going to introduce us?" She held out a formal hand and her fingers brushed Alicia's for an instant. 'Then she turned and stared at the old stone house. "How quaint, Val. It's just like a picture of some old pioneer home." A smile lighted Gram's face. "It is a pioneer home, Winni. My grandfather built it, clearing the rocks from the land to build the house." Hank tapped one of the big stones in the pillar of the porch and remarked smilingly, "Your grandfather must have been quite a guy, Mrs. Latimer." They all laughed as Gram ushered them inside. She hurried off to the kitchen to see about lunch and Val stopped on his way through the hall to poke and pry into every corner. Winni followed Hank and Alicia into the living room and stood in the doorway, a tiny disdainful smile crossing her lips as she saw the rose-sprigged, old-fashioned wallpaper. All at once, Alicia saw that Val had joined them. He was standing just inside the door, his eyes going slowly around the room. When he spoke it was almost as if he were speaking to himself. "Funny, but out there on the islands I kept remembering the pattern of this carpet." HIS toe traced the outline of a big, red rose, and Alicia knew that he meant he had remembered the pattern of everything the way Gram's soft white curtains framed the big bay window, the pictures on the wall, the way the sunlight caressed the piano keys. She saw him straighten as his eyes turned towards the piano and almost at once his face set itself into a hard, gray mask. Before he had gone PRELUDE TO SPRING away, Val had played the piano. He had been better than most of the boys who had taken lessons from the one country teacher. Val had something that set him just a little apart. Now that thing was gone. He would never play again. Alicia found herself shivering as she watched Winni cross the room and strike a few chords on the piano. As the girl lifted her throaty voice in a crooning sort of song, Alicia wondered if she had ever known the grim, unsmiling man who listened. When she was through, Hank clapped a little. "That's the idea, Win. You've got it now. It'll go over big with the band if you sing it that way at the opening of the season at the Bronze Club." All at once Alicia knew she was going to cry. She had to get away. Her voice was smothered as she said: "I... I must go. Mother will be expecting me for lunch." She turned and hurried away. But Val followed her through the hall and out to the porch. There he faced her almost angrily. "Why are you running away? Aren't we friends any longer, or... " his lip curled bitterly, "... Or is it that you don't want to talk about my hand?" His words battered at her defenses and the tears rolled down her cheeks. "Oh, my dear, my dear," she whispered, and caught her lower lip in her teeth to stop the words. But it was too late. Everything she had ever dreamed was in her voice, her words. He looked into her clear, fine eyes, then turned abruptly away. "It's not myself I'm thinking of," he muttered, "it's Gram and Winni. Both have a right to something better than a one-handed man!" He 175 looked out over the bleak landscape, at the barren fields, the leafless cottonwoods, the little brook that wandered through the muddy meadow, and his voice was scornful. "I can't ask Winni to live here. Gram wants me to. But this is ugly... Dead. Winni's beautiful and talented. She has a career before her, singing with Hank's band. Gram belongs here, but she's got to come away with us. Someone's got to look after her, now. She's worked too hard. She's old. ['ll sell the farm and get a job...." But he stopped and held up his hand, his eyes filling with sardonic hurt, his lips twisting into a smile that cut into Alicia's heart. "There must be something a one-handed man can do," he said harshly. "There is, Val!' It was Winni's voice and though it was meant to be soothing, Alicia heard a rasp to it that was meant for her. Winni's eyes accused her of upsetting Val. Of hurting him. Winni said defensively, "Val's going to play the piano in Hank's orchestra." At Val's quick little movement of dissent, she said sharply, "I've told him again and again that he can do it. He was always beating out left-hand melody at the hospital when I sang there. He's good. I've been trying to convince him that he can join the band and make a living in spite of his hand." As if the matter were settled, she put her hand on his arm and drew him towards the door. "We'll see you sometime," she told Alicia cooly. It was several mornings later, while Alicia was pruning her roses, that Val came down the road and stopped at her gate. "A thorn among the roses," he said teasingly, reminding her of the young lad who had come 176 down the lane when children. "You can't get on the best side of me," she said sternly, though her eyes laughed, "by handing, out compliments." His legs were long enough to step over the gate without opening it. He came to her side and caught her hand. "The way you're digging among those roses, I doubt that they'll ever bloom. Winni's getting her beauty sleep. She's used to being lazy. I woke early and Gram set breakfast on the kitchen table just like she did when I was a youngster." His eyes were young and gay. "Now I want to look things over, everything that I missed when I was away. You're going to show them to me." OE pulled her to her feet, his left hand strong and warm about her fingers, and pushed open the gate. Alicia knew she had never been so aware of anyone as she was of this tall, firm-shouldered man striding along that she must skip a step every once in a while and run a little. He wore brown slacks and a brown wool sweater that matched his rumpled hair, and for the first time he looked rested and happy. But grimness crept back into his face as they walked around the farm. Though the sun was growing warmer no green shoots, except the dried breeze. At a board nailed crooked against the barn, and his voice was hoarse. "Gram's been carpenter, handy man, and everything else since I've been ay. It makes me sick to think of der-length veil and said softly, "She's loved doing it, Val. She s done it a stick in his left fingers and slashed at the tops of the dried grass. His voice chilled her with its scornful tone. "Remember, Lissa, when we were kids, we used to pretend that sticks were ships going out for treasure." He tossed the bit of stick in his hand into the water and watched it out of sight. His lips curled "Fine treasure my ship brought in.  The defenselessness of his young face stabbed her to the center of her She longed to put out her and to touch him, to hold him closely in her arms. If only were some way she could help him! This was Val's problem. He must solve it alone. He one who could help. Her voice was crisp in spite of what it cost her to speak. "Each man fights for his own treasure, Val.  He turned on her angrily "I m sick of fighting. The world s sick of fighting. All we know is peace   Not the sort of peace,  objected Alicia fiercely,  that makes us weak.  For a moment she thought he waws going to shout at her, put his hand against her shoulder and shake her. PRELUDE TO SPRING Then his shoulders drooped and he appealed to her with childlike simplicity. "Tell me, Lissa, what can I do? How can I fight against..." he waved his broken hand towards the cold, dark land... "all this!" There was so much pain in his voice that she swayed a little towards him, then drew sharply back. Her eyes as they met his were darkly blue and earnest. "You could plow that field!" He looked at it, his eyes lighting quickly. "Gram would like that," he said. "She wants to plant some sugar beets...." his voice trailed despondently away. "It takes two good hands to plant and plow. It's easier to sell." 'The old hardness was back in his face. "I've got a buyer," he finished curtly. "Winni's going back to town for the opening of the club. I've decided to join the band. As soon as I've worked up some good left-hand tunes, I'll be going too. Winni's going to find Gram an apartment..." ALICIA found hysterical laughter bubbling towards her lips. Val looked at her curiously. "What's the matter?" he exploded. "I've got everything worked out, and you don't seem to like the idea." "He fixed her with a baleful glare and asked, "Just what do you think I should do?" She didn't mean to say any more, but in spite of her resolution she found herself repeating the words: "Plow that field." He sputtered angrily, "I'll bet you think I don't know how. I'll bet..." Then he stopped, turned. Furiously on his heel, and marched across the meadow. It was several mornings later that 177 Alicia woke to the sound of gulls following a plow. She went to the window and her eyes widened swiftly. Val was plowing the field! As she watched, the plow slipped from his fingers and she saw him angrily dash the perspiration from his forehead with his shirt sleeve. For a moment she thought he was going to leave the team standing just where it was. Then he snatched up the plow and followed it doggedly up and down the furrows. They wobbled crazily, but he went on and on. Alicia's smile was tender as she let the curtain fall into place. He came down the road that evening and sat on her front steps in the early spring twilight. He lifted his left hand and showed her the blisters that stood out red and angry across the palm. He smiled shamefacedly. "I started to plow because I was so angry at you. But I got to liking it. It took me back to when I was a kid and followed Dad when he plowed." She laughed joyfully. "I used to follow, too, and get in the way. Do you think I'd get in the way if I followed you tomorrow?" "Td like it," he said, and added slyly, "if you won't be shocked if I grumble a little." Within a few days the field was plowed and planted. Gram smiled as she brought them tall glasses of cold milk and big wedges of spice cake. "It's like old times to have you two kids under foot again." She turned and looked at the house. 178 "The house would look the same, too, if it had a coat of paint on the windows and doors." "If that's a hint," said Val flatly, "I can't hear a word. Let Mr. Thurgood paint his own house, when he buys it." Mr. Thurgood seemed anxious to do it when he 
came to look the farm over. He strode about, a running fire of words falling from his lips. "I ll paint the woodwork gray to blend with the stones. And I'll
pull down those sheds and coops and build new ones.  He put his fingers in his vest and his chest swelled. "This can be the slickest farmhouse
in the community, once I get it fixed up." Gram grew pale as she listened to
him. "But the woodwork's always been painted white," she began, then turned and hurried away to look after her chicks. When Mr. Thurgood was gone,
Val asked Alicia to come with him to the tool house. There was a sort
of little-boy determination in his face. "There are some unopened cans
of paint in the shed. I bought too many five years ago when I painted the place. Gray woodwork will look homely with those gray stones. Mr. Thurgood doesn't know a thing about painting. He hasn't had much experience with farms. I'm sure
he'll like the woodwork painted white." He looked through tools and boxes,
baskets and gunny-sacks which had been pushed helter-skelter into the shed for four years, and emerged, dusty, yet triumphant, with the paint. Alicia helped him mix it and got a brush. Together they found the ladder and set it against
the bay window. Alcia was a great help. She handed Val things and ran back
and forth fetching and carrying. Once, her heart almost stopped when Val took something in his right hand. He doesn't know it, she thought breathlessly, hoping he wouldn't see the happiness shining in her face as she hid it beneath the soft veil of her lovely hair, but his fingers are beginning to respond to his need of them. When he doesn't think about his hand, he uses it a little.
CHE felt she had never been so happy in her life, watching this miracle happening to Val. In the evenings she and Gram sat on the porch and listened while Val worked out runs and arpeggios with his left hand, and once when he struck a wavering chord with his right. Gram's eyes filled with tears. "It's God's great work," she said simply to Alicia. As the days grew longer, a transformation took place in the land. The middle of April brought the
first rich ripples of growing things. The grass along the brook tossed greening fronds to peek into the flashing water. The buds on the trees in the orchard swelled and burst into the first white touches of blossoms-to-be.
Then, one night while Alicia and Gram were listening to the soft strains of Val's music, he stopped abruptly and came out upon the porch, standing there in the shadows so that they could not see his face. Words came haltingly, as if he
wanted to say them but was a little ashamed. "I've been thinking, Gram. Things look a lot different around here than they did when I first came. Today the farm looked almost beautiful, like it did when I was a kid." He stopped, stared
out into the shadows, and said more slowly than ever. PRELUDE TO SPRING "I've been wondering if I should sell it. After all, you like it here, and it's always been a good living for the Latimer men." The rocker Gram sat in creaked a little, and through the dusk Alicia saw the joy and wonder that flooded her faded eyes. "Yes," she said softly. "Yes, it's been a good living, and more than that, Val, it's been home." Val was silent for a long time. Then he said: "Winni's coming back tomorrow. I'm going to try to make her see it the way I do now. I'm going to ask her to stay." He swallowed quickly, and added: "I'm not going to ask her to give up her career. We're close enough to the city so that she can still sing with Hank. But this would be our home." He stepped back through the screen door and closed it softly. Alicia heard Gram's voice whispering a little prayer: "Thanks! Thanks, so much." 'Then Val's left hand swept over the keys and in another moment his right followed carefully. To Alicia the music was the sweetest she had ever heard. When Winni and Hank came back Winni jumped from the taxi and kissed Val. "Let Hank take care of the things, darling," she said, linking her arm through his. She gave Gram and Alicia a careless nod and began explaining about the club. "They were crazy about me, darling. People are hungry for music and a good time. I do hope you've been practicing your music lessons like a good little boy." Her smile was teasingly lovely. "Because I'm sure you'll make a hit with the left-hand beat." She followed him up the walk, 179 scarcely listening to what he was telling her about the paint and the plowing. At last, hearing a certain note of importance in his voice, she stopped and looked around. "It does look better, Val," she admitted carelessly, "if an old house and farm can look better. But you should see the apartment I've picked out. It's small, yet big enough to hold a grand piano. We'll both need it, you know." He did not answer as he opened the screen, but Alicia saw the old defeated look in his face. When he sat down to play the piano, he did not attempt to use his right hand. As time went by, Alicia realized with a sinking heart just how much ground Val had lost. He sat alone a good deal and the bleakness in his eyes hurt her. She found herself listening to hear his laughter, but it did not come. Winni mothered him prettily, assisting with the smallest tasks, worrying lest his hand bother him. The farm was neglected while Val banged out blue notes on the piano. Then Winni's short vacation was done, and Hank was packing his violin back into its case ready for the morning. Val was picking strains out upon the piano keys while Gram and Alicia washed up the milk pans. "Let's run through that Chopin polonaise once more," said Winni, and began the words in a low, pulsing tone. Val's left hand stumbled against a note, and she broke off angrily: "It's too lovely to spoil, Val. Try the Tschaikowsky. It's a novelty the way you do it with the left hand." "Yes," agreed Val harshly, "'it's a novelty," and Winni stared at him with astonished eyes. 180 "You say that as if you didn't like to play it," she said sharply, and burst out, "I don't know what's come over you Val, but you're changed. You don't seem to like doing my songs any more. I've tried to be kind when you missed the notes. I've tried to understand and be patient. I've tried to make you interested in a Career. But I've failed, Val. You'll never make a hit at the club. 'There's no use kidding yourself. If you could play with both hands..." She shrugged the matter away as quite hopeless, and said flatly, "Well, from now on, you've got to make up your Own mind. Do you want to be a left-hand pianist, or do you want to stay here on the farm and go to seed?" He didn't answer, and she followed Hank to the stairs. There she paused and said: "Things can still be the same if you want them to be, Val. Hank and I are leaving in the morning. If you decide to come, all you have to do is pack a bag." Her heels clicked sharply as she went up the steps. Val stood quietly in the hall until her bedroom door closed sharply. Then he went outside and Alicia heard him pacing up and down the walk. When she left to go home, he did not speak to her. A week later, he came marching along the road and entered her back door without more than a perfunctory knock. "The pussy willows are bustin' out all over," he said smilingly. "And those sugar beets are almost big enough to weed." He took the dish towel from her hand and drew her away from the sink. Without even waiting for her to put on a hat, he led her across the meadow to the edge of the brook. There he stopped and picked up a stick. He tossed it into the water and it slipped out of sight. "1 eft-handed solos aren't treasure enough," he said, and his eyes held hers, "I want my ship to bring back something more precious." His right hand stole up and cupped her soft chin, and his eyes looked deep into hers. "Tell me that it will, Lissa, darling. Tell me that it will bring love and happiness and everything a man wants from the world." His hand came down from her chin and went about her waist, strong and firm and determined, and he waited for her words. "Yes, Val," she said softly, "Yes, my dear. He held her close and kissed her. Then he let her go and stood arm in arm looking over his land. "Soon you'll be a Latimer, darling," he said softly. "Then as long as life lasts we'll watch through the winters of life for our preludes to spring. And they'll always come. No matter what happens now, spring will always come."
