Grosgrain Ribbon Handbag 1. MATERIAL REQUIRED: 9 yards grosgrain ribbon 14 inches wide, 2. CUTTING: 1/3 yard lining, sheet wadding. Suggested materials Taffeta, crepe, rayon satin. (A) Cut sixteen 9% inch lengths of ribbon. (B) Cut two 30 inch lengths of ribbon. (C) Cut remainder of ribbon into 4 equal lengths, approximately 28 inches each. 3. SEWING: Stitch 8 of the ribbons (A) together, as near the selvage as possible, (scant 1/8 inch seam). Basting is unnecessary. Stitch the remaining 8 ribbons (A) together (to make the two sides of the bag). Stitch together ribbons (B) for ends and bottom (Figure 1). Baste (B) to the two (A) stitchings just inside the selvage, allowing 1/4 inch seam at the bottom of each (A). Leave an opening 1% inches wide, 1 inch from the top of the bag for insertion of the handles (4 openings). Stitch. If (B) is too long, trim off even with top of bag (Figure 2). Turn wrong side' out and fit a piece of the lining to the bottom of the bag. Stitch along the sides, with the raw edges of lining material exposed, following seams made when sewing (A) to (B), leaving ends open. Slip in cardboard to fit (Figure 3). Measure around the top of bag (should be about 26") and depth (should be 94") and cut lining to fit (one piece, about 26' by 914'') allowing 14 inch seam at side, 114 inch seam at bottom and % inch seam at top. Stitch side seam. Baste lining to top of bag and stitch. Sheet wadding should measure the same as lining without the seam allowance. Baste in between the bag and the lining. Fold under seam allowance of lining and stitch by hand to the bottom of the bag, catching in the raw edges of the lining in the bottom. The bag should be wrong side out all through this procedure. While still so, stitch by hand through lining and sheet wadding to each inside seam of (A) and (B) % inch from top of bag and again 214 inches from the top so there will be a 2 inch space for the handles to lace through. Page 358 Tum bag nght side out. Stitch 2 pieces of (C) together close to selvages, thereby making one ribbon double thickness, (for handles). Lace through opening between sheet wadding and grosgrain completely around bag and stitch ends together. Stitch the remaining 2 pieces (C) together and lace through from the opposite side. Fasten the sewed ends of handles inside the openings at (D) and (E) (Figure 6).
