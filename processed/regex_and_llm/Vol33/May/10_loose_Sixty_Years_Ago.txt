Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent May 1 and May 15, 1886 "For the rights OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women of ALL Nations" SPRING How shall I woo thee, beautiful spring, What shall my offering be Once more we are permitted to behold the most beautiful quarter of the year? young, vernal, glorious spring! The season when all nature arises from her long, cold, deathly sleep, throws off her alabaster shroud of snow, enters her dressing room and robes herself in glorious apparel of every hue and texture and comes forth as a bride. Editorial FROM TUBA CITY, (Arizona): We are almost out of the world here, and do not receive the news very readily.... Our general health is good as it always is; death, excepting for accident and old age, has never visited us during the seven years of our settlement here. Our postoffice address is Tuba City, though the place is better known by the name Moan Copy. We have a weekly mail now, still there seem to be some irregularities, which we hope will be overcome in time. ?Mary A. Farnsworth, President of the Relief Society.

When making a new carpet, always save the ravelings for use in darning the carpet on some future day, as the colors will match better than any yarn you are likely to find. A bill-of-fare book is a good thing. A plain, strong, blank book is what is needed. Every day when the morning's work is done, sit down and write therein what you will have for the next dinner, supper, and breakfast. In this way a pleasant variety and a better class of cooking will be secured and all needed preparations can be made methodically, instead of a harum-scarum, hurried manner at the last moment. OUR LITTLE PAPER: One can realize most fully when absent from Zion or the valleys of the mountains what a power in the hands of the women of this Church a newspaper is. We are all well aware that many of our sisters think very little of the Woman's Exponent, and look upon it as too insignificant for them to patronize, or even to read, but they do not comprehend its importance. If they did, they would open their eyes in wonder when one tells them the Mormon women publish a paper.... We would entreat our sisters to give this silent messenger of their views and expressions more liberal patronage and careful attention in the near future. Editorial Page 314
