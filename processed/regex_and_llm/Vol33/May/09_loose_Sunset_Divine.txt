SUNSET DIVINE Pauline Kirkwood And gazed enthralled at the Picture I saw As the sun slowly sank in the west. The sky above was all aglow With color beyond compare, For God had made a canvas of the sky And painted a Picture there; And the Stay clouds floated their tarlaton Veils Splashed with Carmine and gold. Done for you by the great Master's hand? So cherish it tenderly, took the picture from out of the sky And brought it away v^th me; Now it hangs on the wall of memory. Color divine in a symphony.
