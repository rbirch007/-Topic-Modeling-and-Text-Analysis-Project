on a mission, she unhesitatingly insisted that he go, though it left her not only without her dearly beloved husband, but with the full responsibility of the farm and the children. She knew that he would be gone when her next child should be born, but she carried on unflinchingly. The relationship between President McKay's mother and father was a beautiful thing. 'There existed between them a bond of love and devotion rarely found. To him she was always the lovely, brown-eyed girl he had first seen, sitting on the tongue of a wagon, looking as pretty as a picture in her pink sunbonnet. To her he was her strength, her protector, the loving father of her children. In her home, she was a charming hostess. Her fragrant flower garden supplied many a bouquet for shutins and funerals. She served in the Relief Society and in the Mutual Improvement Association. She was the mother of ten children, children who loved her devotedly, who built their lives around her teachings. It is no wonder President McKay wrote this about her: My Mother! God bless you! Your purity of soul, Your faith, your tenderness, Your watchful care, Your supreme patience, Your companionship and trust, Your loyalty to night, Your help and inspiration to father, Your unselfish devotion to us children? These and every other virtue that contribute to ideal motherhood, I associate with you, My Mother! In Memoriam President Louise Y. Robison Counselor to Sister Robison in the Relief Society General Presidency (This address was delivered at the funeral services for Sister Robison held in the Assembly Hall, Salt Lake City, Utah, Thursday, April 4, 1946.) TODAY, for the first time, I have the responsibility of speaking in this building without Sister Robison at my side. On all other occasions, knowing that I was frightened, she would reach her hand out to mine and say, "You can do it." And somehow, when she said this, we stood up and with the help of the Lord did our best. I feel that she is encouraging me now, that I can see her sweet smile and that she is telling me that no matter if I fail to express adequately what is in my heart, she knows what I feel and think, and how ardently I would love to give fitting utterance to my and your admiration and love. I am sure that all our hearts are filled to overflowing with pride and gratitude. We are proud that one whom we love so dearly has gloriously prepared herself for a greater work. We are proud of the honor. Sister Robison brought to the Church and to the Relief Society in all the contacts she made, national and international. We are proud that we are numbered among her friends. We are deeply grateful for her lovely self, for her beautiful life, that we were so blessed as to be permitted to work with her. We a grateful that she was our president. There is sadness in our hearts for we know that something lovely has gone from our lives. No more will come those precious letters so full of love and encouragement, that always came when needed. She gave us so much of sweetness, she poured so much of warmth into our hearts. How we shall miss her! But we know that our sorrow is for our own great loss. We know that this is a glorious day for Sister Robison ? Commencement Day ? and that she graduated with the highest honors. We know that her beautiful, radiant personality, her charm, her poise, her captivating sense of humor, her graciousness, her sympathy, her great love, her abiding testimony ?all of those qualities which made her a great leader, so lovable and beloved will go with her and be intensified in her new sphere of activity. Someone has said that the happiest person is the one who thinks the most interesting and beautiful thoughts, and that such a person never grows old, but grows happier as the years pass. This was true of Sister Robison. The last time I talked with her she was not well. Though nothing could dim her radiant spirit, her delightful humor, yet I sensed a yearning of her soul for higher things, for greater service. Page 295. Kate M. Barker PRESIDENT LOUISE Y. ROBISON LOUISE y. ROBISON The opportunity for greater service has come. What a wonderful lifetime of service she has given here�eleven years of which she was president of the great Relief Society of the Church. Translate this into kind words, encouraging words, inspirational words, into kind deeds, into days and years spent in seeking those things that would enrich the lives of the women of the Church, and what a glorious record we have. She gave so generously of her time and always of herself, we wondered at her vitality. She gave so cheerfully. I have told her many times that she must be a great joy to her Father in heaven, she served him so cheerfully.
She was always solicitous of the women and so appreciative of their work. She so loved the "Singing Mothers" and I know how beautifully she would express her appreciation of this group today who have come to sing to do honor to her. When she stood before a group and said, "Dear Sisters," something went from her heart to touch our heartstrings and we had a spiritual feast.
Probably her greatest contribution to Relief Society was the strengthening of the ties of unity, love, and co-operation. She traveled much, visiting wards and stakes and missions, and every visit strengthened the bonds of love and friendship.
Her vision of Relief Society was one of sisterhood and friendliness. Hear her plea:
"In some of the wards we still find there is lack of hospitality. We go to a meeting and are so in earnest in the work we are doing, that we are not as attentive as we might be to those fine women who come to our meetings. We do not feel that
way when a friend comes. We are happy to have her come and we tell her so. Cannot we take this hospitality into our ward Relief Societies?
"There is nothing in the world that makes work go so smoothly as to be thoughtful and courteous to everyone."
She exemplified this kindness in her own contacts. How often she expressed her love and appreciation to the Relief Society workers:
"Often we know that you have patiently labored with sad hearts and tired hands to render the service required in these times of distress, and no cry for help has gone unheeded. From our hearts we thank you. We honor you and love you . . . We face the future with confidence and hope born of our faith in you and in the gospel of our Savior, Jesus Christ."
I have heard both officers and members say: "Oh, Sister Robison, we can get so close to you and feel you are close to us."
One bishop in a remote ward said, "Sister Robison belongs to the Church�not to one ward or stake. We all feel she belongs to us."
She truly had that great gift, "the understanding heart�the human touch."
In one of her addresses, she told of the night in Gethsemane, when the Savior, knowing that he was facing a terrible ordeal, could have called legions to help him, but he took his friends with him and said, "Tarry ye here, and watch with me." He was sorrowful unto death and while he prayed they slept, and when he came to them he said, "What, could ye not watch with me one hour?" (Matthew 26:40).

Women Poets in Review Anna Boss Hart Member of the Relief Society General Board PART I COME with me to greet a few C of our women poets in review. We will not linger long today, however great or well-known the poets may be, but you may wish to become better acquainted with them in your home and spend many hours with each one in your own cosy reading nook. You will be in awe of some and treat others as casual friends. This is such an inviting time of the year to greet new and old friends? book friends. Just as soon as there is a tinge of spring in the air and peace in our hearts, we receive new life; we hear overtones in nature; color is richer; life is more abundant. Let us meet some of our women poets whose poetry sings this spring day. Francis Ludlow has said that women whether real or imaginary? escape all classification. These women who pass in review have a special gift the gift of poetry, a rare gift. "Poetry is simply the most beautiful, impressive and widely effective mode of saying things," said Matthew Arnold. The poet fixes landmarks that our children's children may see and travel better for seeing. It is true that many a poet "puts out a finger, and leaves a star wherever he touches." A poet is happy when he finds the unwritten poems men live by. Poets often feel symphonies in song that others never hear. How strangely Page 298 susceptible to divine inspiration they are! And now, as we skip the centuries, we greet Sappho whose name has outlasted "floods and hurricanes, the erosions of rain and frost and famine, and all the wars." The beautiful Sappho, a name which the Greeks for more than a thousand years placed next to that of the great Homer. Her image was stamped upon coins. She loved nature and had the power to express in striking language the living beauty of her surroundings. Sappho had the power to be direct, intense, strong that "wondrous creature without comparison during her time." In the words of the ancient epigram: Sappho's white, speaking pages of deaf song Yet linger with us, and will linger long. During Sappho's time the genius of women developed itself to a degree unsurpassed for a thousand years. In the highlands of her home country, Lesbos, women enjoyed more culture than elsewhere. She was one of the founders of the lyric poetry of the world. Alcaeus, her townsman, and one who shared the honor of being a founder of lyric poetry, addressed to her these exquisite lines: Violet-crowned, pure, sweetly smiling Sappho. WOMEN POETS IN REVIEW Few facts of her life are known. She was born in 612 B. C. No doubt she knew by heart her Homer and Hesiod. Many were her admirers, and one fortunate admirer won her hand. By him she had a daughter, named after her own mother, Cleis: I have a little maid, as fair As any golden flower, My Cleis dear, For whom I would not take all Lydia, Nor lovely Lesbos here. What a picture of the southern summer, with its noonday siesta in _ the open air, we have in her lines: The lullaby of waters cool Through apple boughs is softly blown, And shaken from the rippling leaves, Sleep droppeth down. She knew, too, that she herself would not be easily forgotten: I think there will be memory of us yet, In after days. 299 Sappho lived to a ripe old age, and died leaving a name which Plato called the "tenth muse." 

we will meet one of the greatest of the singing women of England, who lived centuries after Sappho. She is Christina Georgina Rossetti, whose matchless lyrics cause her to loom above other women of her period. She was born in London, December 5, 1830, of Italian origin, daughter of Gabriel Rossetti, a well-known commentator on Dante. We can imagine the four Rossetti children in the garret spending the time together before their bedtime. Christina, the youngest of the four, would be listening to Maria tread aloud, while her brothers, Gabriel and William, colored prints. Already, as a young child, Christina was religious and reflective. At eighteen she resembled Gabriel's A Perry Picture SAPPHO From a Painting by Alma Tadema (1836-1912) A Perry Picture ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING (1806-1861) painting of Mary, the Virgin, for which she had posed. Within Christina there was a "keen, white sharpness, protecting, like a coat of armor, something she held above the treasures of the world." One would not expect this when her outward appearance was soft and womanly. Her poetry reflected her life. Sometimes, painting her sheets of paper, knitting, or going about her duties, she looked on the world with shining eyes: My heart is like a singing bird Whose nest is in a watered shoot; My heart is like an apple tree Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit; My heart is gladder than all these Because my love is come to me.... "Song" and "Remember," and many others of her exquisite poems should be read and reread. As she grew older she seemed to become a younger sister of her mother. After the last link that still held her to the world had snapped, she lived on in the hope of life everlasting, where all she held dear awaited her. mention Elizabeth Barrett Browning in review, brings to us the remembrance of a poet loved and well-known. Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) led a life exceptional in various ways. Possessed of a sturdy soul in a frail body? "her mind was disciplined by an un- _ usual education and her character by prolonged illness." Her father built for the family a mansion of oriental splendor, and there he placed every one of his children "in a gilded cell and locked the door." Elizabeth often longed "to slip downstairs through all the sleepy house and escape." There were but two secrets that she kept from her father, forbidden books and_ her dear friendship for Robert Browning. It was on May 20, 1845, that Robert Browning was at last permitted to come to Wimpole Street. When Elizabeth took matters into her own hands and set sail for Italy as Mrs. Robert Browning, her father said, "My daughter is now in her grave. Let us forget the dead." Her poetry increased in depth and beauty from the happiness of her marriage, yet the love sonnets written to Robert Browning during their courtship days are exquisite in thought and structure. When her husband saw these poems, he prevailed upon her to have them WOMEN POETS IN REVIEW published as "Sonnets from the Portuguese." What favorites these sonnets are! I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. But love me for love's sake, that evermore Thou mayest love on through love's eternity. Just three days after Elizabeth's forty-third birthday, a son was born to them. And from her newborn babe she felt a newborn strength. That was the peak of her happiness! Again, how sad she must have felt when she tremblingly read a letter and found a package from her father, addressed to Robert Browning: In the accompanying package you will find the letters sent to me by your wife. All these letters, you will note, have remained unopened. The seals upon them are still intact. Elizabeth's father died shortly after the return of the letters. The news of his death brought on a collapse from which Elizabeth never fully recovered. She has left us poetry full of living fire. | HEARD A ROBIN SINGING Zara Sabin
