The Gift of the Genie LaRene King Bleecker SUPPOSE that a genie came S to you as you sat alone in your living room, bearing a gift. "Here, on this silver tray, is an education for you," he might say. "You have only to pay one dollar and, presto! Great knowledge shall be yours." How you would thrill as you reached forth eager hands to grasp this wonderful gift. "Why, that is almost like finding it," you would exclaim. But a genie is not likely to do that, for he exists only in fairy tales; and such a thing as an education handed to one on a silver tray could never happen. Literally, perhaps, it could not, but we have its equivalent within our own homes, ready for us to reach out and take, any time we care to do so. And such a complete education as we should receive: Complete courses in_ theology, literature, social science, and visiting teachers' messages; excellent articles on sociology, biography and pioneer history; latest achievements of noted women, stories, articles, poems, all these, together with splendid instructions from our spiritual leaders. From experience, I know this education can be obtained, for I have the gift of the genie here on the table within my reach, the source material out of which I shall absorb my knowledge. When I have finished, I shall have mastered the rudiments of knowledge and self Page 310 culture that lead to a more abundant life. How I came to realize the value of this gift as a source book began one busy day quite a few years ago when there were a thousand and one things to be done. I had dropped into a chair with a gasp of dismay, having just remembered that I was to give a talk on sociology at a study club that very afternoon. Where could I find material at this late hour? There wasn't time to go to the public library and the textbooks on that subject were tucked in the lockers of my two sons at college. Then I recalled that in a bound volume of TheI had read a very fine article on "Why Study Sociology," by Dr. Harold T. Christensen, author of the lessons in social science then appearing in the Magazine. It contained all the source material I would need for my-notes and information. While browsing through that same number, later, I found a short article that suggested a plot for a story which was finally accepted in a prize-winning contest. On another day, I wanted a gift for a friend who was in need of a cheering philosophy to help her regain mental poise after having gone through the tragic loss of a loved one. Again I went to my source supply the Magazine. In searching through back numbers, the thought came why not make for this friend a little booklet made up of poems and household hints, THE GIFT OF THE GENIE I used first, the Eliza R. Snow memorial Prize-winning Poems published in the January Magazine for 1945, then the three intervening and home were shorter to a Charted Course?" Marler Hoggan, as Printed in the January number for 1946. In Making this booklet, I had to obtain extra numbers of the Magazine from the neighbors who do not make a practice of keeping them on file from year to year because of lack of space especially in small apartments If this is being done by you for the same reason, and you haven't had your Magazine bound (which can be done for a nominal cost) why not try a filing system by utilizing space on the closet shelves? MY method of filing the Magazines is rather simple, but effective in saving time. I compile them according to their subject matter. December numbers usually carry the Christmas theme; Mother's Day material can be found in the April or May numbers; pioneer articles in July; conference reports in the June and December numbers. If there are special stories, articles, or lessons I wish to preserve, I list their titles in red pencil on the outside cover, thus saving the time one would spend in thumbing through them. I also have Magazines listed which contain articles to which I can refer for child guidance, home problems, postwar planning, how to greet our returning soldiers, and many other timely, educational facts. Concerning our soldiers, there is an excerpt from an address by President J. Reuben Clark (September 1945, page 523) that every mother, wife, and sweetheart of a returning soldier should memorize and put into practice. If this were done, the problems of our boys and their home readjustment would be adequately solved. As class leaders, we often have need for verses, quotations, or timely suggestions. When reading current numbers, therefore, I have formed the habit of listing the things that have special significance or appeal. A five-cent notebook is all that is needed in jotting down the subject matter, the number of the Magazine, and the page. Not long ago a friend was in need of a short story to be retold at a parent-teacher's meeting, touching on the problem of mothers who work away from the home and the effect their absence might have on the children. In the January number of the Magazine for 1945, page 34, is a story "Mama's Boy" by Alice Morrey Bailey, which seemed to be made to order for the very purpose. There is a story on the mother-in-law versus daughter-in-law problem by Edith Lovell in the February number, 1945, page 92; also, a beautifully constructed story in the January issue of this year "Spring Festival" by Mary Ek Knowles, the prize-winning story, which carries out the theme of idealism versus realism. In like manner, I have found source material for essays, articles, lectures, and story plots. But, best of all, there is a way to banish that inevitable blue day that comes to even the best of us. Call it mental fatigue, spiritual laxness, nervous let-down ? anything you like, but whatever it is, there is one unfailing cure read your Magazine. Or, if you have read the current number, get out your olds and browse through them. Soon your morale will return and you will experience a renewal of mental and spiritual strength and courage. Besides inspired lessons and editorials, you will get a digest and review of world happenings; you will read articles on travel, biography, and religion, combined with poetry, literature, and art. Then there are bits of humor and reminiscences of special interest because they are similar to the things we have had happen in our own lives. One such special feature entitled "I Remember" by Elder Rodney B. Taylor, rich in restrained humor and atmosphere, gives an account of how a little Mormon community in Canada entertained an English lord and his aristocratic daughters (April 1945, page 208). Special significance, too, are the poems inspired by the Eliza R. Snow Memorial Contest announced in June of each year and which ends in September, the winners being announced and the poems published in the January issues. The Magazine also conducts a short story contest, the rules and results of which are also published in June and January. No greater asset to culture can be found anywhere than in this splendid method of encouraging our poets and authors, to whom we owe the tribute of reading and rereading their inspiring poems and stories. If one kept only the Magazines containing these stories and poems, think what an asset they would be to any home library. The rapid tempo of modem life, together with its growing complexities, contributes to the increase of fear and anxiety in the homes of today. How shall we meet such fear? What shall we do to obtain serenity of mind and heart? Now, more than ever before, mothers are required to be stalwarts, to remain calm in the face of confusion and bewilderment. Theis a supplement to our faith. It is the source book by which we obtain a more abundant life, by which we become better, wiser mothers; it educates us, helps us to be sure of ourselves, to be reliant and happy, to gain knowledge with which to enrich the lives that God has entrusted into our care. May I make a plea to each of you if you haven't been in the habit of keeping back numbers, start the filing habit now. If you haven't a closet shelf or an attic, a trunk will serve, or even the cupboard shelves. As we store away food for our physical needs, so also, we may store sustenance for our mental and physical hunger. Associate intimately with the THE GIFT OF THE GENIE fine in of our editors, our church leaders, Our authors, and those inspired specialists who outline the Magazine lessons. Here then, in your education, the ablest contribution from our best informed instructors in this or any other age. Then, if you haven�t already done so, subscribe now for the current year. Then, believe it or not, you will have your silver tray of knowledge at hand. The genie will be bowing before you, and the abundant life will be yours. A
