I heard a robin singing in the rain one day, When things for me had long gone wrong; At first, I would not listen to his song, But clutched close to my heart its poignant pain; For what, I thought, have I to do with cheer Or spring or song or lilting loveliness, What is there now for me but bitterness Since I have lost the one I hold most dear? So gladly rang his gleesome roundelay It seemed I had to hear him, and I turned To where he sang so blithely unconcerned With storm or cloud or wild, wind-driven spray. Then all unbidden, quite to my surprise, A smile quick-twinkled in my brimming eyes.
