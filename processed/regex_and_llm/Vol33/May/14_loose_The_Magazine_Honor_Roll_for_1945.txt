The Magazine Honor Roll for 1945 Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer UBSCRIPTIONS to the Magazine continue to show steady increase, based upon comparative total figures for December 1944 and 1945. In December 1945, a total of 74,- 032 copies of the Magazine were mailed as compared to 71,281 in December 1944, an increase of 2,- 751, or 3.86 per cent. Following the usual course, the honor roll, printed in this issue, recognizes all stakes, wards, missions and branches whose subscription rates equal or exceed 75 per cent. The 1945 honor roll contains more names than ever before?1102, an increase of 82, or 8.04 per cent over the preceding year. Following are the comparable figures for 1944 and 1945: appointed as Magazine representative, the name of the president appears. Great credit is due the supervisory stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives, and all of the ward and branch Magazine representatives who have done the arduous work of procuring subscriptions, with the assistance and support of Relief Society officers and members. To the Magazine representatives who have the responsibility of obtaining the subscriptions, and to all who assisted them, the General Board is very grateful. As an expression of its appreciation, the General Board is again awarding a free, one year Magazine subscription to all local representatives who procured subscriptions equal to 75 per cent of 1944 1945 Increase & Decrease No. Per cent Local Relief Societies In Stakes In Missions 245 Supervisory Organizations 101 Stakes Missions 6 7 7 2 + 16.66 Mission Districts Total on Honor Roll 1020 The honor roll is arranged in alphabetical order and the name of the Magazine representative appears opposite the name and record of each Relief Society listed. In those instances where no one is Page 322 the ward or branch Relief Society enrollment as of the end of 1945, and to all stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives appearing on the honor roll. The Magazine honor roll is based THE MAGAZINE HONOR ROLL FOR 1945 on subscription reports submitted to the General Board. However, the British, Hawaiian, Northern California, and South African Missions (of the English-speaking missions ) failed to submit subscription _reports for 1945. Also, a few districts of some of the reporting missions failed to respond?1 in the California Mission, and 5 in the Northern States. Reference to the annual Relief Society reports compiled by the secretaries indicated that the unreported missions had local Relief Societies with rates entitling them to a position on the honor roll and they were, therefore, included. However, none is included from the British, Hawaiian, New Zealand, or South African Missions from which no report had been received by press time. We take special pleasure in congratulating the 18 stakes,  323 mission, and 7 mission districts with Magazine subscription rates of 100 per cent or more. Of this number 8 stakes and 5 mission districts are making their first appearance in the highest ranking group. In the local Relief Societies, 511 of the 992 on the honor roll achieved rates of 100 per cent or more. These hundred _percenters constituted 50.46 per cent or 385 of the 763 award-winning wards in stakes and 55.02 per cent or 126 of 229 award winning mission branches. The excellent records are due in many instances to the fact that some mission and stake Relief Societies have had unusual opportunities to place the Magazine in the hands of investigators and non-members. The local societies with exceptionally high rates appear on the following page.

Jordan Nampa Nevada San Fernando Sugarhouse Uvada THE MAGAZINE HONOR ROLL FOR 1945 Achievements of Missions In the missions, four of the six which appeared on the 1944 honor roll maintained their positions in 1945, namely, Australian, Southern States, Western Canadian, and Western States. The Northern States Mission did not reach the quota this year. The report from the South African Mission did not reach the office in time to be included in this report. Three new missions made the honor roll this year Canadian, North Central and Northwestern. The Australian Mission still leads the stakes and missions of the Church with 140 per cent. The 1944 honor roll showed 24 mission districts. The 1945 honor roll shows 22 mission districts of which the following maintained their 1944 rating: South Coast and Mojave Desert of Califormia Mission; Central Indiana, Central Ohio, and Wisconsin of Northern States Mission; -Northern Montana of Northwestern States Mission; Central Florida, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Alabama, South Carolina, South Florida, South Georgia, West Florida, and West South Carolina of the Southern States. Six new mission districts were added this year: Las Flores of the California mission, North and South Illinois of Northern States Mission; Central Oregon, Great Falls, and Yakima of Northwestern States Mission; and North Texas 325 of the Texas-Lousiana Mission. Six of the districts on the honor roll in 1944 failed to qualify for this year? San Gorganio and Santa Barbara of the California Mission; East Michigan, South Ohio, and West Michigan of the Northern States Mission; and South Louisiana of the Texas- - Louisiana Mission. In addition to the stakes, missions, and mission districts in which local Relief Societies attained rates sufficient to place the entire area on the honor roll, 64 stakes and 8 missions are represented not by a rating for the stake or mission as a whole, but by one or more of their local Relief Societies which attained honor-roll status. Accordingly, a total of 145 stakes (all but 7) or 95.39 per cent and of 19 English speaking missions, 15 (all but 4) or 78.95 per cent are represented on the 1945 honor roll by one or more local Societies. Reports from the British, Hawaiian, New Zealand, and South African Missions had not reached the office at the time of this report. We tegret that the Carbon and Portland Stakes, which were on the honor roll in 1944, are not represented this year by even one ward. The General Board expresses its deep appreciation of the splendid results attained during one of the most stressful periods of history? the climax of the war and its aftermath.
