Mothers of the First Presidency Luacine C. Fox ARAH FARR SMITH Mother of President George Albert Smith "President Smith, what qualities in your mother have had most influence in your life?" I was sitting in his spacious, wood-paneled office as I awaited his reply. President George Albert Smith answered me at once, quietly and simply, "Her tenderness, her devotion to her children there were eleven of us, you know." I hadn't known. He told me she had been a "real mother" and he added, with a little smile, "Of course, to us, she was the best mother in the world." He n to reminisce: "When I was a little fellow, just getting so I could climb the stairs, I remember mother took me by the hand, led me up the stairs into the bedroom where my crib was, and, sitting by my crib, she had me kneel. She took both my little hands in hers and taught me how to pray, and do you know the prayer she taught me?" When I shook my head, he repeated the simple words of the well loved child's prayer: Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep, And if I die, before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. "And even then," he continued, "young as I was, that prayer went through me, and I felt confidence in it. I felt secure." He told me of another incident? the only time when he willfully disobeyed his mother. "She took a little willow stick and marched me into the kitchen and was about to whip me with it, but I took hold of both her hands and wouldn't let her do it." "What did she do, then?" I asked him. " 'Why,' she said, 'I'm not going to whip you, Son. If you're old enough to know you can stop me by holding my hands, then you're too old to be whipped,' and she never did it again." President Smith's mother, Sarah Farr Smith, was the daughter of Lorin Farr and Nancy Chase Farr. She was born in Salt Lake City, 30 October, 1849, in a house that stood on West Temple Street between First and Second North. When she was still a child, the family moved to Ogden, Utah, where she remained until her marriage to John Henry Smith, 20 October, 1866. Then she returned to Salt Lake City and made it her permanent home. Sister Smith was never well, and therefore unable to take an active part in the Church. Her home duties Page 29] 292 and the care of her beloved children occupied all of her time. She did enjoy traveling, and often accompanied her husband on his trips when his calling as an apostle took him to different parts of the United States, and even to Mexico. After a well-spent life, and after rearing a splendid family, she passed away in February 1921. As I listened to President Smith's words ? words of love, of respect, the words of a devoted son about his mother, the thought came to me? what joy she must know now her son the child she had home and reared and taught had been chosen by the Lord to be the Prophet, Seer and Revelator of the Church on earth. Surely no greater reward could come to a woman for years of patient service to her children, for the diligent, persevering teaching of her son. As I looked back over the brief glimpse I had been given into these lives, I thought again of the child by a crib, a small boy being taught the words of a simple prayer the faith he had in that prayer. I seemed to see him mature, a mother's devoted care constantly strengthening that faith; a mother teaching him the gospel, patiently and tenderly. I saw him now even as he sat there ?and was enriched by the power of righteousness I felt in him and the inspiration that came to me from him. What a glorious role is that played by the Latter-day Saint mother who works in partnership with God to train her sons for labor in the gospel of Jesus Christ. And, truly, Sarah Farr Smith, mother of President George Albert Smith, was an outstanding mother in Israel. MAY LOUISA WOOLLEY Clark, Mother of J. Reuben Clark, Jr. First Counselor in the First Presidency President Clark, in reply to my question concerning his mother, Mary Louisa Woolley Clark, said this, "Among my mother's teachings, best remembered, are these: First, and above all else, be chaste, tell the truth no matter what follows. "Bear your own troubles uncomplainingly, without inflicting them on others. "Do your full duty always and do not expect praise or reward for doing it. "Do whatever you have to do in the best way you can. "Be humble, not boastful; let other people do the bragging. "Work; be honest; don't cheat. "Be fair, considerate, respectful of the rights of others. "Don't carry tales. "Live so that you will not disgrace yourself or your family. "Try always to be a real, genuine man. "Be loyal to every trust, to your family, your friends, your Church, your country, and your God." In this statement I found the strength, the indomitable courage, the determination, and deep-rooted faith of President Clark himself. I knew that his mother must have been a remarkable woman and I found that she was. Mary Louisa Woolley was born 5 July, 1848, in what is now Keith County, Nebraska. Her father, Edwin Dilworth Woolley, and THREE MINIATURES FROM LIFE mother, Mary Wickersham Woolley, were on the way to Utah. They stopped on the evening of the 4th of July. Mary Louisa Woolley was born, and the journey was continued the following morning. Once in Salt Lake, Mary Louisa's father built a home near the old Social Hall. When a child of seven or eight years, she took a prize at the city fair, for being the "best specimen of pioneer days" and this was because she was wearing a homespun dress held together, not with buttons, nor with pins, but with thorns from bushes in City Creek Canyon. She used to spin yarn, as a girl, and she assisted Rachel Grant (mother of the late President Heber J. Grant) in making men's shirts which were sold at the Z. C. M. I. Much of her time was spent in St. George, Utah, where some of her brothers lived. She was active in Church functions and socials there, taking part in musicals and dramatics as well. She was twenty-one when she met Joshua Reuben Clark, Sr., and she married him two years later in the Endowment House. Sister Clark led a rich life a hard life. She and her husband pioneered in their early married life. Their first home was a log house in Tooele County, which her husband had built with his own hands. Her life was full of work. President Clark remembers her doing her heavy washing in the winter evenings, and hanging it out and coming back into the house with her hands so cold that she buried them in his thick hair to warm them. He remembers massaging her feet and ankles for 293 her when they ached at the end of a busy day. And her days were very busy ones, with ten children to rear. But with it all, she was uncomplaining and brave. She passed on to her son her love of life, her love of the soil. He has her fearless courage her unwavering testimony of the gospel. He is a son of whom she was justly proud. She was the mother who helped endow him with those qualities which the Lord has required of him as First Counselor in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. ENNETTE EVANS McKAY Mother of David O. McKay, Second Counselor in the First Presidency. President David O. McKay has paid many tributes to his mother, Jennette Evans McKay, but to me none of them is more beautiful than these: "I cannot think," he said, "of a womanly virtue that my mother did not possess. Undoubtedly, many a youth, in affectionate appreciation of his mother's love and unselfish devotion, can pay his mother the same tribute, but I say this in the maturity of manhood when calm judgment should weigh facts dispassionately." "The older I grow, the more deeply grateful I am for the life and influence of a perfect mother." Every woman dreams of hearing her son or daughter say such things! And every Latter-day Saint mother longs with every fiber of her being to set her son's feet on the path of right and to help him tread that path throughout his sojourn on earth. Every mother seeks to instill in her 294 son the love of the beautiful, the respect for and ideals of womanhood that President David O. McKay has; the gentleness, the kindliness, that enfold every deed of this righteous man. His mother, Jennette Evans McKay, was born in Glamorganshire, Wales, 28 August, 1850, just three months after her parents, Thomas Evans and Margaret Powell Evans, with their older children, had become members of the Church. On July 8, 1856, the family arrived in Iowa, having set sail from Wales the preceding May. They stayed for nearly three years in Iowa, finding it quite a change from Wales, while Jennette's father prepared constantly for the journey to Utah. They left for Utah in the private company of Captain Buzzard. They had good wagons, splendid horses, and they took along a cow, so that they were supplied with fresh milk and butter along the way. On the 18th of August, 1859, they arrived in Salt Lake City, and, after a brief stay of two weeks, moved on to Ogden where they made their home which was a happy home. Jennette married David McKay, April 9, 1867, after which they went to Huntsville and lived on a large farm not far from an Indian reservation. She was ever ready to make any sacrifice for the sake of the gospel. Not long before the birth of one of her children, when the call came for her husband to go across the ocean
