THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AND WHAT OF TIME Mabel Jones Gabbott And what of time? Is it a stream That flows in season's cycles through Life's valley? Is it running sand That turns life's hourglass for you? Can it be measured by the spring, The summer, the ensuing fall, Or charted into days and months To robin's chirp and wild geese call? Of time there is no measuring, For it is boundless. All the days Of yesteryear are voiced this dawn In our weak, fumbling, groping wavs; And all tomorrow's promise; all Its dreams are inextricably Linked with the doings of this hour To fashion our eternity. The Cover: "Mirror Lake in the High Uintahs." From a photograph by Grace O. Tuttle VOL. 33, NO. 8 AUGUST 1946 Photograph by Grace O. Tuttle "SYMPHONY IN BLUE AND WHITE" White Daisies and Turquoise Blue Delphiniums
