THE NEW TESTAMENT Dorothy ]. Roberts 'And Jesus said...." Here are his words Brought safely through the ages down to me, And, though I cannot thank the ones who saved them, I read, believing they were meant for me.  Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 2 Love of Fellow Man President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, November 5, 1946 Objective: To show that the pioneers possessed the qualities of character necessary to live the "second great commandment," love of neighbor. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, and who is my neighbor? (Luke 10:25-29). |e made answer by giving the parable of the good Samaritan, thus indicating that all men are neighbors to each other and should render unselfish and helpful service to their fellow men. After thus describing the unselfish service of the good Samaritan, he then said to the lawyer, "Go, and do thou likewise." It takes real strength of character as well as unselfishness to be neighborly and charitable in the broad sense which Jesus thus taught and thus emphasized. This doctrine is so strong and includes so much self-giving and self-sacrifice that living it strictly is a real test of strength. Church history, as well as the pioneer stories which have come down to us, testify to the neighborliness, co-operation, and true charity practiced by the Mormon pioneers.   Because of their common experiences, their common needs, and their common problems, they could well understand the inward feelings and desires, the hardships, sufferings, and heartaches of one another. They therefore sacrificed and shared together, they comforted one another, and thus helped to carry one another's burdens. In their preparation for the great western march and especially during the journey the pioneers traded and loaned their scant belongings, they divided and shared whatever they had in the way of food, clothing, bedding, and other supplies. One of the rules they adopted was, "Every man is to put as much interest in taking care of his brother's cattle as he would his own. And no man will be indulged in idleness." In those companies where space in the wagons for passengers was limited, and when there was hard pulling for the animals, in whatever wagons there was space, preference was given to little children, the aged, and those who were ill. After they reached the Valley, their co-operative efforts continued, and the stupendous work they accomplished in the first years was the result of their unselfishness; and LESSON DEPARTMENT the fraternal spirit that united and held them closely together, added to the spiritual guidance with which they were blessed. After the newcomers arrived, arrangements were soon made for their temporary employment. Public works were established on the temple block, 555 including shops for carpenters, blacksmiths, machinists, and others. In this way many received their first start in life in Utah. Thus, through their co-operation and neighborliness, they grew in understanding, unselfishness, benevolence, and brotherly love. Work Meeting  Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 2 The Use of Tools and Treatment of Materials Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman For Tuesday November 12, 1946 Textbook Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter III Treatment of Fabrics NEARLY all types of material need some preparation before cutting out a garment. This includes woolens, cottons, linens, silk, and rayons. Reputable companies usually label their materials so that the purchaser may be sure of the kind of treatment, if any, that may be required. Unless otherwise specified, all cottons should be shrunk before cutting. If the cloth is colorfast, shrink it in hot water in order that the fibers of the material may be thoroughly penetrated, For a complete soaking, it is advisable to leave the material in the water all night, if possible. If you wish to retain the new look of the fabric, do not unfold it during the shrinking process, and press it while it is still damp. Stretch the selvage before pressing the center of the material, and iron it lengthwise. Woolens, unless they are to be tubbed, can be successfully treated by pressing with a steam iron, or they may be shrunk according to the instructions given on page 30 of The Complete Book of Sewing. Always clip the selvage and press the cloth lengthwise. Silks and rayons, if they are to be dry-cleaned, need not be shrunk, but, if they are to be tubbed, they should be shrunk. The same method used for cottons can be applied for silks and rayons, except that cooler water should be used. A small amount of vinegar or water softener may be added to the water. Use of Tools Before you start any sewing, be sure that everything you will need 556 for your work is assembled in a large workbox. Never start working without the right tools and all necessary supplies. Use good tools. Have on hand a supply of needles in sizes 1-12 for handwork, and 00-4 for sewing machines. After a little experience, you will realize the importance of selecting the correct size in both needles and thread for various types of fabrics. The professional seamstress strictly obeys this rule. Make a practice of using dressmaker's pins. These pins are sharp and do not mar the fabric. Keep them in a box by themselves, and do not use them for other purposes. Many people believe that they cannot sew with a thimble. It is impossible to sew successfully without a thimble. Select one that fits perfectly, but do not attempt to sew with it while it seems awkward and in the way. It requires days to become accustomed even to a new ring. The thimble presents an even more difficult problem. Put the thimble on the correct finger and wear it for several hours each   day until it is no longer an annoyance. Then begin to sew. It is necessary to become well acquainted with all the parts of the sewing machine. Know the purpose of each part and how it works. For this purpose it is advisable to secure from the maker of your particular sewing machine a book of instructions. Refer to this book when difficulties arise. Never tur any of the screws on your sewing machine unless you know what you are doing. Keep the machine well-oiled and in good condition. A dress will have a homemade, clumsy look if the fine pin fitting of the garment has been destroyed in pressing. After a garment has been fitted to the curves of the body, if it is pressed on a straight board, the curved portions will be pressed out flat. Therefore, the curved portions should be pressed on a curved cushion. This type of cushion is very easy to make, and you will find it one of your most necessary tools for the well-turned seam, especially in the pressing of the sleeves. How to Make a Curved Cushion for Pressing Take two circular pieces of muslin, 12 inches in diameter, and sew them together with a % inch seam, leaving a small opening for the insertion of wadding. 'Turn the material inside out so that the seam is on the inside, and fill it solidly with woolen batting or chipped woolen scraps, such as woolen underwear. It is not advisable to use cotton for this purpose, since cotton batting has a tendency to wad and become lumpy. After the cushion has been stuffed, close the opening by stitching it carefully. Assignment for the instructor: Bring materials and be prepared to demonstrate steam iron and sheet shrinkage of woolens. Assignments for sewing class members: The sewing instructor should make all assignments one week before the lesson is to be given. For the November lesson, the sisters should each bring two circular pieces of muslin, twelve inches in diameter, and the stuffing for making the curved cushion. Assignment for December: Bring to the sewing meeting a tape measure and sufficient shrunk material for making one garment. LESSON DEPARTMENT 557 Revealed in Its Literature Lesson 2 Colonial Founders of America in Literature Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, November 19, 1946 discovery, exploration, colonization are the first three steps in the epic of America's making. For the Latter-day Saints, the intriguing story reaches back to the days of Jared and Zarahemla, and down through the time of Lehi and his sons on their voyage to this goodly land for settlement and develop-. Ment. For other folk the beginning ~ of the epic is in the legends of the Viking, Lief the Lucky, who, it seems historically certain, found the shores of America about the year 1000 A. D., and remained with his followers for a brief period in a region they called Vineland. Then follows a lapse of nearly five hundred years before the land was rediscovered, as a "New World." Columbus, who believed as we do, that he was inspired by the Lord, piloted with dauntless courage the way across the fearsome Atlantic. In a stirring poem named for the great discoverer, Joaquin Miller makes one feel the heroic spirit and the vision of Columbus. Following are excerpts from this American lyric: Behind him lay the gray Azores, Behind the Gates of Hercules; Before him not the ghost of shores, Before him only shoreless seas. The good mate said: '"'Now must we pray, For lo! The very stars are gone. Brave Admiral, speak, what shall I say?" "Why, say, 'Sail on! Sail on! And on!' " Then, pale and worn, he paced the deck, And peered through darkness. Ah, that night Of all dark nights! And then a speck  A light! A light! At last a light! It grew, a starlit flag unfurled! It grew to be Time's burst of dawn. He gained a world; he gave that world Its grandest lesson: "On! Sail on!" Another poet who, with soul lifting lines, has portrayed the spirit, the achievement, and nobility of Columbus, is Tennyson. In his poem of that title, the hero is pictured in chains, recounting to a friend high lights of his own life story. Following are typical lines: Chains for the Admiral of the Ocean! Chains For him who gave a new heaven, a new earth, As holy John had prophesied to me.... Who push'd his prows into the setting sun, And made West East.... Were you at Salamanca? No. We fronted there the learning of all Spain.... No guess-work! I was certain of my goal; Some thought it heresy.... Against God's word. Thus was I beaten back, And chiefly to my sorrow by the Church, And thought to tum my face from Spain,... But our Queen Recalled me, for at last their Highnesses Were half-assured this earth might be a sphere. All glory to the all-blessed Trinity, All glory to the mother of our Lord,... I have accomplish'd what I came to do. One thing that stands out in the story of Columbus is his attributing to divinity first honor for the achievement that marks his name. The isle on which he first set foot in the New World was named San Salvador (Holy Savior). With the banner of Spain as emblem of possession of the discovered realm, was planted the cross of Christ as a symbol of dedication of the domain to God. Religion has been the potent force that has held America thus far true to its course. Though lure of gold, desire for land, adventure, brought many to the New World, yet only love of God, expressed through active goodness, has permitted them to carry forward in the constructive development of America. This, we know, is in accord with divine promise made by American prophets long before Columbus or Lief the Lucky. In essence, they have said that this land is consecrated to God, and that it shall be a land of liberty so long as those possessing it shall serve him and keep his commandments (see II Nephi 1:5,7,8; also Ether 2:8-12). Our own part of America was settled largely by varied groups of people seeking a place where they might worship the Lord in peace. Thus came Protestants of different creeds, and Catholics to establish their communities or colonies. Among these God-fearing folk were the Pilgrims, justly extolled in the following poem. LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS The breaking waves dashed high On the stern and rockbound coast, And the woods against a stormy sky, Their giant branches tossed; And the heavy night hung dark The hills and waters o'er, When a band of exiles moored their bark On a wild New England shore. S * Amidst the storm they sang, And the stars heard, and the sea; And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang To the anthem of the free!  There were men with hoary hair Amidst that pilgrim band; Why had they come to wither there, Away from their childhood's land? There was woman's fearless eye, Lit by her deep love's truth; There was manhood's brow, serenely high, And the fiery heart of youth. What sought they thus afar? Bright jewels of the mine? The wealth of seas, the spoils of war? They sought a faith's pure. Shrine. Aye, call it holy ground, The soil where first they trod! They have left unstained what there they found  Freedom to worship God!  Felicia Dorothea Hemans. Keeping this key thought clearly in mind that true Americanism is rooted in Christian religion and that our liberties are predicated on acting concertedly to keep in the path of God's righteousness let us follow through this study of colonial founders of America. Since time will not permit taking up every one of these groups of freedom seekers, attention will be mainly centered on three leading ones. LESSON DEPARTMENT Old Virginia, to begin with, was first among the English-American colonies. In 1607, under charter which provided among other things for the extending of the principles of English freedom, a band of adventurers sailed in three ships into Chesapeake Bay and up the James River for a short distance. A convincing, if somewhat melodramatic, portrayal of these old days in Virginia, may be found in To Have and To Hold, by Mary Johnston. Its plot is set in the incident of bringing English girls to Virginia to be purchased by the planters. Another worthy novel picturing later days in this colony is The Crossing, by Winston Churchill. There is indeed a wealth of literature poetry, fiction, oratory, which helps to bring the events and characters of the "Old Dominion," as the colony was sometimes called, vividly to us. At first glance, it might seem that there was little of religion connected with its founding and development. This, however, is far from true. Days of "the starving time," brought the adventurers, it would seem, to their knees. When Lord Baltimore with his relief ships sailed to the succor of the colony, he was hailed, it is said, "with chastened joy, and with the cry, 'It is the Lord of Hosts: God will raise our state and build his church in this excellent clime!'" Within this growing colony, the great son of Virginia, George Washington, was reared. With a Godfearing mother, and with religious influences about him, be became the Father of our Country. Though not a man of letters, he has left many precious words of counsel that re- 559 veal his truly religious spirit among them these: A good moral character is the first essential in man. It is our duty to make the best of our misfortunes. True religion affords government its surest support. Another thing, besides its return to and cultivation of religion, marks the colony of Virginia as a soundly American commonwealth. This is the continuing fight of its patriot leaders for the fundamental principles of liberty. Though its settlers, at first, were largely of aristocratic type, and though it did not, in the beginning, permit religious liberty, there gradually rose defenders of freedom. In 1676, Nathaniel Bacon led a successful revolt against the King-appointed tyrant, Governor Berkeley, but the patriot died in the midst of victory. Others succeeded Bacon only to die as martyrs for liberty. Out of their spirit, one hundred years later, other Virginians rose to play brilliant roles in our war for freedom. - In 1620, thirteen years after the first colonists had come to Virginia, another group of English folk landed at Plymouth Rock, on the shore of what soon was to become Massachusetts. Simple, God-fearing folk were these Pilgrims, seeking a haven where they could work and worship together in peace. In solemn agreement, made on board the ship that had borne them across the stormy Atlantic, they stated clearly their purpose, and covenanted before God to co-operate in framing "just and 560 equal laws" such as were deemed "for the general good of the colony" and promised obedience to these laws, enacted of their own free will and choice in their new homeland. This "Mayflower Compact" (see page 565) plainly set forth the basic principles of true Americanism. With its acceptance by these plain, honest folk, the cornerstone of our nation was laid. It was a dedication under God to the American way of life. To keep that pact, even now, is to assure us all of freedom in a realm consecrated to righteousness. A wealth of literature has been created around these Pilgrims and around another group of freedom seekers, the Massachusetts Bay Colony, who came ten years later to settle in the region where Boston, and nearby communities were developed. Some of these creations, doubtless read by many during school days, will yield new riches with rereading now to bring old colonial days, in thought, customs, and wholesome drama, closer to us. No finer picture of the Pilgrims has. Been given than Longfellow's poetic symphony "The Courtship of Miles Standish." Through its musical and artistic lines one feels the spirit of those earnest, God-fearing folk, sees them at work and worship, meets their serious problems, and realizes their fine courage and faith, their devotion to the Lord. Just a few excerpts here from the classic poem for illustration. These from the scenes of the return sailing of the Mayflower. John Alden, after his soul-searching experience with Priscilla and Miles Standish, is pictured as he: Joined in the morning prayer, and in the treading of Scripture, And, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the sea-shore, Down to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as a doorstep Into a world unknown the comer-stone of a nation! He had resolved to go back with the ship, to forget his troubles: But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that was passing. Suddenly his resolve changed and within himself he said: "Here I remain!... Yes, as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing, So, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving!" Meanwhile the Master, alert, but with dignified air and important,... Walked about on the sands, and people crowded around him Saying a few last words, and enforcing his careful remembrance. Then, taking each by the hand, as if he were grasping a tiller, Into the boat he sprang, and in haste shoved off to his vessel, Glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry, Glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow, Short allowance of victual, and plenty of nothing but Gospel! Lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the Pilgrims. O strong hearts and true! Not one went back in the Mayflower! the Long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel,... Then, as if filled with the spirit, and wrapt in a vision prophetic, Baring his hoary head, the excellent Elder of Plymouth Said, "Let us pray!" and they prayed, and thanked the Lord and took courage  LESSON DEPARTMENT So they returned to their homes; but Alden lingered a little, Musing alone on the shore, and watching the wash of the billows Round the base of the rock, and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine, Like the spirit of God, moving visibly over the waters. * e Ge Thinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla;... Lo! As he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him. Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, portraying stern Puritanism, is another classic story. In "Mabel Martin," by Whittier, we have echoes of old witchcraft days. Another of his poems, "Snowbound," is an artistic portrayal of the wholesome family life of old New England. For bits of humor with colonial flavor yes, critics to the contrary notwithstanding, the Puritans did get some good fun out of living we may turn to such selections as "The Wonderful One Hoss Shay," by Holmes, "The Courtin'," by Lowell, or "The Pine Tree Shillings," by Hawthorne. A few excerpts, from the story last named, will serve here to illustrate this earlier day humor. Captain John Hull be it said for introduction  as mint-master of the colony, had by melting up battered silverware of all sorts, and transforming it into bright pine-tree shillings, and taking his honest toll for the service, made himself rich. Then came Samuel Sewell, a "personable young man," of. Good habits, and "a member of the church," courting the mint-master's only daughter, who is called Betsy. In describing her, the author says that she was "'by no means so slender as some young ladies in our own days. On the contrary, having always fed heartily on pumpkin pies, doughnuts, Indian puddings, and other Puritan dainties, she was as round and plump as a pudding herself." 561 To young Samuel, when he asked for her hand, the father said in his rough way, "Yes, you may take her; and you'll find her heavy burden enough...." On the wedding day we may suppose that honest John Hull dressed himself in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which were made of pine-tree shillings.... Thus attired he sat with great dignity in his armchair; and being a portly old gentleman, he completely filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite side of the room, between her bridesmaids, sat Miss Betsy. She was blushing with all her might, and looked like a full-blown peony or a big red apple. The mint-master was pleased with his new son-in-law, especially as he had courted her out of pure love, and had said nothing at all about her marriage portion, or dowry. So when the marriage ceremony was over, he whispered a word to two of his menservants, who immediately went out, and soon returned, lugging in a large pair of scales. They were such a pair as merchants use for weighing bulky commodities; and quite a bulky commodity was now to be weighed in them. "Daughter Betsy," said the mint-master, "get into one side of these scales." Miss Betsy or Mrs. Sewell, as we must call her did as she was bid, like a dutiful child.... But what her father could mean, unless to make her husband pay for her by the pound (in which case she would have been a dear bargain) she had not the least idea. "And now," said honest John Hull... "bring that box hither." The huge box was tugged across the floor. Unlocked by the father, it was found "full to the brim of bright pine-tree shillings." At the Captain's command, the servants heaped these, handful after handful, into one side of the scales, on the other side of which stood the bride. Finally, "plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the young lady from the floor." "There, son Sewell!" cried the honest mint-master, "take those shillings for my daughter's portion. Use her kindly and thank Heaven for her. It is not every wife that is worth her weight in silver." From Grandfather's Chair, by Hawthorne. 562 ~ Appreciative rereading of some of these classic selections will bring clearer pictures of colonial New England. The pictures were drawn when their creators were closer to that life. Better acquaintance with the earlier portrayals will also enhance the reading of more modern creations dealing with the same general materials and themes. In Western Star, by the late gifted poet, Stephen Vincent Benet, will be found a realistic and appreciative portrayal of modern cast, of the early Virginia colonists and the Pilgrims. This is a theme that has attracted authors of America through the years. It was in 1683 that Penn, on the good ship, Welcome, sailed up the Delaware River to join the people of his chosen faith who had preceded him to America. In response to the welcome that greeted him he said simply: "You shall be governed by laws of your own making, and live a free, and if you will, a sober and industrious people." On the banks of the Delaware, he laid out Philadelphia, the "City of Brotherly Love." A legislature appointed by the people was to make all the laws. There was to be no religious intolerance; those of every faith were welcomed. No tax could be levied, save by law. All that was required of freemen to vote and hold office was that they believe in God and keep his Sabbath day holy. Every child was to be taught some useful trade. Penn's peaceful policy in dealing with the red men is proverbial. Under a spreading elm at Shackamaxon, he met with their elders. "The friendship between you and me," he said to them, "I will not compare with a chain; for that the rains might rust.. We are all one flesh and blood."   Touched by the white leader's kindliness and sincerity, the Indians responded, "We will live in love with William Penn and his children as long as the sun and moon shall shine." On strings of wampum they kept record of the treaty, and would often rehearse its provisions. It is said to be the one and only treaty that was never sworn to, and never broken, Latter-day Saints will appreciate this story, for the policy adopted by President Young with the Indians of the West was in spirit and actions closely akin to that of William Penn. For a clearer view of old Philadelphia by one who knew it intimately, one should read The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. As a boy in severe Boston, he sighed for a place more genial and friendly; and he found just this in the "City of Brotherly Love." His story of the trip he made there by working his passage on a boat through Long Island Sound, and afoot across New Jersey, again by boat down the Delaware until he came to the "quaint old Quaker town," and of the first days he spent there, are classic. Through his life story, much of it in this Philadelphia setting, one may get clear, convincing pictures of old colonial days. There is no better firsthand book dealing with those times. John Greenleaf Whittier, himself a Quaker, also brings us close to the heart of the followers of William Penn, Here are a few stanzas from LESSON DEPARTMENT a poem in which he pays tribute to these simple, God-fearing folk: The Quaker of the olden time! How calm and firm and true, Unspotted by its wrong and crime, He walked the dark earth. Through. He walked by faith and not by sight, By love and not by law; The presence of the wrong or right He rather felt than saw. He felt that wrong with wrong partakes, That nothing stands alone, That whoso gives the motive, makes His brother's sin his own. * *& * O Spirit of that early day, So pure and strong and true, Be with us in the narrow way Our faithful fathers knew. Necessary limits to this study preclude more than passing tribute to the other liberty-fostering colonies of our America. Each of these, picturesque and significant in contributions to the life and progress of our country towards freedom, has its own intriguing story and wealth of literature. In New York, formerly New Amsterdam, it was the sturdy Dutch who first made settlements. Popular portrayals in humorous, yet appreciative vein, by Irving, have given us entertainment through the years. We must read between the lines, however, of Rip Van Winkle and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, to get at the true, thrifty, hardworking folk he playfully portrays. To the Dutch, America owes much for their promotion of free schools, their religious tolerance, their unwavering support of fundamental principles of free government. As one poet has written: 563 Yet deem them not for ridicule a theme, These worthy burghers and their spouses kind, Scorning of heartless pomp, the gilded dream, To deeds of peaceful industry inclined, In hospitality sincere and grave, Inflexible in truth, in simple virtue brave.  Mrs. Sigourney Maryland, settled by the persecuted Catholics, is another colony deserving of more extended study than can be given here. Under Lord Baltimore, who founded this haven for an oppressed people, two ships, the Ark and the Dove, sailed into Chesapeake Bay in 1629, and planted the city that bears this leader's name. Its charter gave to all freemen voice in making the laws. All sects were to be tolerated; and there was to be no taxing by England. Another group of religious refugees, the Huguenots from France, found a new home on the shores of America particularly in the Carolinas. They brought not only new fruits and flowers to that sunny clime, but also the refinements of their old French homeland, and withal they carried industry, charity, and morality, and love of freedom with them. Puritan intolerance was largely responsible for the founding of another colony of truly American spirit. Roger Williams, insistent on freedom of conscience in his worship, was made so uncomfortable in Massachusetts, that he finally left for the wilds and found welcome with the Narraganset Indians. Red men, be it said, seem not to have made differences in religion a bar to their hospitality. In essence, the story of many other colonies is of like spirit and purpose, planned as a haven of refuge. Georgia, founded by General Oglethorpe, was a refuge for freed debtors; New Jersey, a harbor for those who were largely of Episcopalian faith; Connecticut, like Rhode Island, became a homeland for many who left Massachusetts as followers of Thomas Hooker, and also of Anne Hutchinson, because they protested against the strictures of Puritan leadership.
Freedom of worship, freedom to share in the responsibilities of their own governing, freedom under self-made laws, were the fundamentals for these colonial builders of early America. In all the literature that truly voices the heart of these varied groups of earnest folk, this love of liberty�orderly liberty�is expressed. It was that for which they sought a home in the New World, for which they endured hardships and dangers. For this precious boon they lived; and for it they were ready to give their all.
Discussion and Activities
1. On what passages of scripture is this promise based: America shall be a land of liberty only so long as its people keep the commandments of God?
2. What are evidences that help
justify our belief that Columbus was inspired of the Lord in his discovery of the New World? (See 1 Nephi 13:12-13.)
3. Give the legend of Pocahontas and John Smith.
4. Select some lines from a poem, novel, short story, oration or other type of literature portraying colonial life, character, or ideals; and be prepared to read it aloud for others of the class.
5. Be ready, under the direction of the this leader, to present a series of excerpts from "The Courtship of Miles Standish," which will give, in condensed form, that story of the Pilgrims, with emphasis on the truly American ideals they exemplified.
