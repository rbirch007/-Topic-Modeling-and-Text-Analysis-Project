THE OLD HOOKED RUG G. Gwen Kelsey In years to come you will see it there  This old hooked rug by the rocking, chair, And all you will see is a faded rug, Making the room look comfy and snug; While I see mother bending there Over the rug, with her silver hair, Hooking a pattern of her joys and care, Trying to ease the heartache and pain, Looking back over the years again, Unfolding the pictures and hooking them in. Making the flowers 4S neat as a pin. A soft old blue brings back memories dear; Her work-worn hands brush aside a tear; Then with a deep, soul-rending sigh, She bows her head and begins to Cry; For the old coat sleeve she 18 hooking on Was once worn by her soldier son; So she tucks in the ends and makes them fast, Colors and rags, S  the rug will last. You would never know, on seeing it there, This old hooked rug by the rocking chair, OF the years of living that are hooked. Between The blues and browns, with the soft moss green.
