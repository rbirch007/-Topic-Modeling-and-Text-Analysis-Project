Pioneer Stories and Incidents THE INDIANS OF UTAH AND THE BLACK HAWK WAR President Amy Brown Lyman {This story is the second in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by Thein honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration.  Ed. AMONG the Indian tribes encountered by the pioneers in Utah and the adjoining areas were the Utes, the Piutes, and the Bannocks all belonging to the Shoshone family. It was the policy of the pioneers to treat these Indians justly and fairly and to try to teach them the arts of civilization. According to the advice of Brigham Young, they were to be fed rather than to be fought. He warned against taking advantage of them in trade or otherwise, or even giving them offense. While the Indians seemed at times to appreciate this friendly attitude, and while some of their chiefs proved to be faithful friends, still, on the whole, in those early days the Indians were suspicious of the white man and revengeful as well. As they saw their lands taken from them, their freedom to roam and camp at will curtailed, and as plans of the Government to segregate them on reservations developed, they were filled with consternation, and they naturally felt that the white men were their enemies. And, to an Indian, it was no sin to steal from an enemy, or even to take the life of an enemy. Misunderstandings, therefore constantly arose, and, because of repeated hostilities and aggressions, and the frequent and wanton _attacks on the white settlers, it was necessary for the latter not only to defend themselves, but in some instances to take the offensive. As a result, there were, for a number of years, skirmishes and even wars. The most serious of these conflicts was the Black Hawk War, so called because Chief Black Hawk was the leader of hostilities. It began in Sanpete County in 1865, and involved Sevier County as well, lasting about three years. It was a desperate struggle and the white settlers in these counties were in constant danger. One of the saddest incidents of this war was that connected with the Kuhre family of Ephraim. The writer was fortunate in hearing this story from the lips of William D. Kuhre himself, for many years the bishop of the Sandy Ward, where he is today greatly loved and respected. Brother and Sister Martin P. Kuhre, were converts to the Church from Denmark, and upon their arrival in Utah, in 1862, they settled in Ephraim, Sanpete County, where they, engaged in farming. On an October day in 1865, they went out to their field on the edge of town to harvest their potatoes. With them were their son William, age two years, Elizabeth Page 515 516 Peterson, a girl of seventeen, who lived with the family, and a young man named Sorn Sorenson. As they went about their work, they were suddenly startled and terrified to see approaching them a band of Indians led by Black Hawk himself. Young Sorenson, who had known Black Hawk intimately before the war, walked over to the chief to try to engage him in conversation and to avert trouble, if possible, until aid might come to them. Black Hawk, who had visited the Sorenson home as a young Indian, and had eaten at their table, seemed a little ill at ease as he stood there facing Sorenson. However, the Indians only a few yards away did not hesitate to make an attack, which resulted in the death of Brother and Sister Kuhre and the young girl, Elizabeth. Sorenson was permitted to escape with his team. After this, the Indians, with about two hundred head of cattle they had acquired, started off toward the canyon. Later in the day, a party of white men went into the Kuhre field expecting to find them all dead. Imagine their surprise when they found the little boy, William, alive. He had been in the arms of his father when the latter was shot, but was uninjured himself. Left alone, he had crept over to where his mother lay, and he was found with a tearstained face, lying upon her breast asleep, with his clothing saturated with her blood. Having no relatives in America, the child was adopted by John and Ellen Dobbie, who tenderly reared him to manhood. The Black Hawk War cost the lives of over seventy white people and the destruction of much property.
