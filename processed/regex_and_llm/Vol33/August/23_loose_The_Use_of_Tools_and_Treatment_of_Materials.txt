The Use of Tools and Treatment of Materials Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman For Tuesday November 12, 1946 Textbook Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter III Treatment of Fabrics NEARLY all types of material need some preparation before cutting out a garment. This includes woolens, cottons, linens, silk, and rayons. Reputable companies usually label their materials so that the purchaser may be sure of the kind of treatment, if any, that may be required. Unless otherwise specified, all cottons should be shrunk before cutting. If the cloth is colorfast, shrink it in hot water in order that the fibers of the material may be thoroughly penetrated, For a complete soaking, it is advisable to leave the material in the water all night, if possible. If you wish to retain the new look of the fabric, do not unfold it during the shrinking process, and press it while it is still damp. Stretch the selvage before pressing the center of the material, and iron it lengthwise. Woolens, unless they are to be tubbed, can be successfully treated by pressing with a steam iron, or they may be shrunk according to the instructions given on page 30 of The Complete Book of Sewing. Always clip the selvage and press the cloth lengthwise. Silks and rayons, if they are to be dry-cleaned, need not be shrunk, but, if they are to be tubbed, they should be shrunk. The same method used for cottons can be applied for silks and rayons, except that cooler water should be used. A small amount of vinegar or water softener may be added to the water. Use of Tools Before you start any sewing, be sure that everything you will need 556 for your work is assembled in a large workbox. Never start working without the right tools and all necessary supplies. Use good tools. Have on hand a supply of needles in sizes 1-12 for handwork, and 00-4 for sewing machines. After a little experience, you will realize the importance of selecting the correct size in both needles and thread for various types of fabrics. The professional seamstress strictly obeys this rule. Make a practice of using dressmaker's pins. These pins are sharp and do not mar the fabric. Keep them in a box by themselves, and do not use them for other purposes. Many people believe that they cannot sew with a thimble. It is impossible to sew successfully without a thimble. Select one that fits perfectly, but do not attempt to sew with it while it seems awkward and in the way. It requires days to become accustomed even to a new ring. The thimble presents an even more difficult problem. Put the thimble on the correct finger and wear it for several hours each   day until it is no longer an annoyance. Then begin to sew. It is necessary to become well acquainted with all the parts of the sewing machine. Know the purpose of each part and how it works. For this purpose it is advisable to secure from the maker of your particular sewing machine a book of instructions. Refer to this book when difficulties arise. Never tur any of the screws on your sewing machine unless you know what you are doing. Keep the machine well-oiled and in good condition. A dress will have a homemade, clumsy look if the fine pin fitting of the garment has been destroyed in pressing. After a garment has been fitted to the curves of the body, if it is pressed on a straight board, the curved portions will be pressed out flat. Therefore, the curved portions should be pressed on a curved cushion. This type of cushion is very easy to make, and you will find it one of your most necessary tools for the well-turned seam, especially in the pressing of the sleeves. How to Make a Curved Cushion for Pressing Take two circular pieces of muslin, 12 inches in diameter, and sew them together with a % inch seam, leaving a small opening for the insertion of wadding. 'Turn the material inside out so that the seam is on the inside, and fill it solidly with woolen batting or chipped woolen scraps, such as woolen underwear. It is not advisable to use cotton for this purpose, since cotton batting has a tendency to wad and become lumpy. After the cushion has been stuffed, close the opening by stitching it carefully. Assignment for the instructor: Bring materials and be prepared to demonstrate steam iron and sheet shrinkage of woolens. Assignments for sewing class members: The sewing instructor should make all assignments one week before the lesson is to be given. For the November lesson, the sisters should each bring two circular pieces of muslin, twelve inches in diameter, and the stuffing for making the curved cushion. Assignment for December: Bring to the sewing meeting a tape measure and sufficient shrunk material for making one garment. LESSON DEPARTMENT 557 Revealed in Its Literature Lesson 2
