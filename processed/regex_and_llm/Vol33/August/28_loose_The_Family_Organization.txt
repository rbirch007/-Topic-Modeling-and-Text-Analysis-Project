The Family Organization Social Science Committee, Leone O. Jacobs, Chairman For Tuesday, November 26, Lesson Link: 1946 In the previous lesson we considered the eternal nature of the family unit. We discussed briefly the pre-existence as the first stage of human development, then stressed the importance of mortality as a proving ground. We learned that marriage is ordained of God and is to be in effect throughout eternity. We shall now consider the practical workings of the family unit, the qualities that are essential for harmonious and successful family life, and the responsibilities of the various members of the family for the welfare of the whole. IN general conference of April 1945, President David O. McKay delivered a forceful address on the subject "Marriage and Divorce" (see Improvement Era for May 1945). He pointed out that "... Marriage is ordained of God unto man" and that, through having offspring, man enables the earth to "answer the end of its creation; And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made" (Doc. And Cov. 49:15-17). President McKay states that: Marriage is a sacred relationship entered into for purposes that are well recognized primarily for the rearing of a family. To look upon marriage as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure in response to a romantic whim, or for selfish purposes, and severed at the first difficulty or misunderstanding that may arise, is an evil meriting severe condemnation, especially in cases wherein children are made to suffer because of such separation. With such a lofty and serious concept, how can Latter-day Saint husbands and wives have other than the deepest respect for the marital bonds? It is a wise providence that provides two parents in a_ family. "Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord" (I Cor. 11:11). One parent cannot say to the other, "My place is more important than yours." Latter-day Saints believe in the equality of the sexes, each in its own sphere. Woman is not considered inferior to man but only different in make-up, as he, in his way, is different from woman. The proper rearing of children is so complex and important that it requires the loving co-operation of both a father and a mother to do it full justice. Moreover, the father and mother, in their divergent personalities, backgrounds, and accomplishments, complement and strengthen each other, and thus build solidarity into the home. When it becomes necessary for one parent to assume the responsibilities of both, there occurs a gap which can never be entirely filled. In general, the responsibility of the father in the home is that of providing sustenance for the family and that of the mother is the bearing LESSON DEPARTMENT and rearing of children. He js fitted by nature to be the protector and leader, while the capabilities of Yet in all important matters, the judgment and influence of both are True Latter-day Saints believe in having large families. It could not be otherwise when we consider that God's first command to man, after his creation, was to multiply and replenish the earth. That admonition is as binding today as it was to our first Parents in the Garden of Eden. President George Albert Smith has said, "it was in the plan of our Heavenly Father that every living thing that he created should reproduce after its kind." Children are Priceless treasures. No greater joy can come to mortals than that experienced through bringing spirits into the world and rearing them accord. Mg to righteous Principles. "Ag allows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them..." (Psalms 127:4-5), Opportunities for development in a family of several children are greater than in a small family. The associations in large families tend to develop qualities of character and disposition that make for genuine success and happiness. And take" children to live more harmoniously with those both within fines of the home. An authority on child welfare has said that an only child has a twenty per cent handicap 577 in marriage, because he has less chance of making a satisfactory adjustment than 4 child who has brothers and sisters, Attributes of Parents Parents, first of all, must love each other dearly and should exhibit love and tenderness toward each other. Affection between Parents is not a thing of which to be ashamed, yet some parents seem embarrassed to display their affection before the children. This makes it appear an unnatural demonstration, Affection among members of the family is beautiful and refining. How can children be expected to exhibit love and tenderness toward Parents and toward each other if the parents themselves do not set the example? For one Parent to criticize or make disparaging remarks about the other is disastrous to the unity of the family, Children are embarrassed when this occurs. The oneness of the family is questioned. Hey may even take sides with one or the other parent or become disillusioned in both. Parents should uphold the decisions of each other before the children and always present a united front. If mother says "No," father should not say "Yes." For example: If father has told Peter he cannot go to scout meeting until the lawn is cut, mother should not allow him to go before the task is completed. F mother is disciplining Alice for, father should not sympathize and tell her to come out before the time is up. Parents must try to see each other's viewpoint and respect each other�s 572 opinions even though they may differ. The fact that Mr. And Mrs. Brown have different views on the advisability of buying a car, or sending Johnny to college, or taking a vacation, does not necessarily mean that they are at loggerheads with each other. Pros and cons can be discussed amicably until a united decision is reached. It is not a sign of weakness to give in or to change one's mind in fact, many times it is a sign of courage or unselfishness. And, when an agreement is reached on any problem, both parents should stand by that decision. With no feeling of resentment or animosity. Father's Place and Responsibility in the Home The father is the recognized head of the family, the bearer of the Priesthood. There is no higher authority in matters relating to the family organization, and especially when that organization is presided over by one holding the higher Priesthood, than that of the father. The authority is time honored, and among the people of God in all dispensations it has been highly respected and often emphasized by the teachings of the prophets who were inspired of God. The patriarchal order is of divine origin and will continue throughout time and eternity..... Wives and children should be taught to feel that the patriarchal order in the kingdom of God has been established for a wise and beneficent purpose, and should sustain the head of the household and encourage him in the discharge of his duties, and do all in their power to aid him in the exercise of the rights and privileges which God has bestowed upon the head of the home.... It is not merely a question of who is perhaps the best qualified.. Neither is it wholly a question of who is living the most worthy life. It is a question largely of law and order... (Gospel Doctrine, pp. 359, 360). When the Priesthood is magnified by the father, the entire family may receive its blessings and inspiration. It is the privilege of the father to exercise the Priesthood in the administration of the sick in his home and to unite his faith with members of the family for the restoration of health. When others are called in to assist in this ordinance, it is the father's place to preside. A father should take pride and joy in blessing and naming his children, in baptizing and confirming them members of the Church, and in taking part in ordinations to the Priesthood of members of the family. It is his responsibility to preside at the table, at family prayers, and in giving general direction to the family. He should be a worthy example in attending to Church duties and in all matters of conduct. It is the responsibility of the father to provide an adequate living for his family. This means food and clothing sufficient for health and self-respect, a respectable home, medical attention, and some provision for wholesome recreation. It is not wise to give to children all the things they wish. President Joseph F. Smith says of this: When indulgent parents fancy that they are adding to the pleasure of their children's lives by giving to them whatever they wish, such parents are in fact destroying the capacity of their children to enjoy the gratification of desires weakened and perverted by over-indulgence. The ability to give to children wisely is indeed a rare attainment, and is acquired only by a thoughtful and prudent exercise of the highest sense of duty which parents can feel for their children. Duty is always preferable to indulgence (Gospel Doctrine, page 373). LESSON DEPARTMENT A father should be a companion to his wife and children. Recreation and amusement should be planned whereby the family may associate together and enjoy each other's company. A father who enjoys playing games with the children, going on hikes and excursions, usually keeps close to his children. There are few circumstances under which family members learn to love and appreciate each other more than when they play together. At such times there is an excellent opportunity to teach children some of the great lessons of life, without their being aware of it without preachment. Occasions arise when fair play, truthfulness, courtesy, fulfilling one's word, cooperation, and many other sterling qualities may be firmly implanted in their lives. Mother's Responsibility in the Home Motherhood is a sublime calling. No public career contributes as much to humanity as does the successful rearing of children. Brigham Young said, ""The mothers are the moving instruments in the hands of Providence to guide the destinies of nations." A mother should first of all uphold her husband as head of the family and in all righteous endeavors. If she sets the example in upholding him, the children will naturally follow her example. She should sustain him in all his Church duties, be proud of his work in the things of God, and encourage and assist him to faithfully fulfill his obligations. Latter-day saint wives enjoy a privilege of which other women know nothing; the heads of their 573 households are men holding the Priesthood of God. Sister Augusta Winters Grant, wife of President Heber J. Grant, said, in an article in TheAs a Latter-day Saint wife I honor my husband as a man holding the Priesthood. It is my firm conviction that if the women of our Church would rely unfalteringly upon the inspiration of their husbands, in all important matters concerning their family affairs, they would find that their husbands would grow in the power of discernment and decision through the exercise of their Priesthood (Nov. 1936, page 671). Not only is motherhood a divine calling, but it is a practical one as well. A mother needs skill in various fields. She must be able to prepare nutritious and appetizing meals, and to make her home attractive and comfortable a place where friends and relatives may feel the warmth of hospitality. Birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays should be made occasions of special significance and pleasure to the family. 'The mother should know the fundamentals of home nursing, that the health of her family may be safeguarded. She must know how to budget the family income wisely so that full value is received and the necessities of life provided. Brigham Young gave this definition of a woman's responsibilities: It is the calling of the wife and mother to know what to do with everything that is brought into the house, laboring to make  her home desirable to her husband and children, making herself an Eve in the midst of a little paradise of her own creating, securing her husband's love and confidence, and tying her offspring to her- 574 self, with a love that is stronger than death... (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 307; 1941 Ed., page 198). It is the duty of both parents to teach their children, from infancy, upright conduct, but this responsibility devolves upon mothers far more than upon fathers, for mothers are with their children a greater part of the time. At a mothers knee children should be taught all good habits and practices. Gospel training must not be left to the auxiliary organizations of the Church. 'They only supplement the fuller teaching children should receive in the home. Children's Responsibilities  Versus -Rights Responsibilities Children are under obligation to render respect and obedience to their parents. "Honor thy father and thy mother" is a command that will ever be in effect. Life is a great gift, and for this gift alone, children should respect and honor parents. Children should be willing to work and share with members of the family and to sacrifice, if necessary, for the welfare of any of the group. Work is a blessing and each child should have duties to perform in proportion to his age and strength. It is good for children to learn the value of money. A certain family for several years had a maid who did the housework; but after some years of service, the maid married and left their employ. At this juncture, the children of the family said, "Why cannot we do the work and earn the money she received?�  The parents thought it a splendid suggestion and, since that time, the children have each assumed responsibility for certain household tasks, in return for which they have been given money for clothes and recreation. They have learned the value of money, developed skill in housekeeping, and gained a feeling of usefulness and independence. When parents become old or dependent it should be the joy, as well as the duty, of children to support and lovingly care for their parents. Rights Children have rights in the home as well as responsibilities. 'They have a right, as they grow older, to a voice in certain family decisions and problems. Sharing in family problems matures children and proves to them that they are an integral part of the family unit. They should have the privilege of inviting their friends to the home and of being assured that the friends will receive cordial treatment. President McKay has said: There are three fundamental things to which every child is entitled: (1) a respected name, (2) a sense of security, (3) opportunities for development. The family gives to the child his name and standing in the community. A child wants his family to be as good as those of his friends. He wants to be able to point with pride to his father, and to feel an inspiration always as he thinks of his mother... A child has the right to feel that in his home he has a place of refuge, a place of protection from the dangers and evils of the outside world. Family unity and integrity are necessary to supply this need. He needs parents who are happy in their adjustment to each other, who are working hopefully toward the fulfilment LESSON DEPARTMENT of an ideal of living, who love their children with a sincere and unselfish love; in short, who are well-balanced individuals, gifted with a certain amount of insight, who are able to provide the child with a wholesome emotional background which will contribute more to his development than material advantages.... No man or woman can create a true home who is not willing in the outset to embrace life heroically, to encounter labor and sacrifice. Only to such, can this divinest power be given to create on earth that which is the nearest image of heaven (Improvement Era, May 1945, Pp. 239- 314). Questions for Discussion 1. How does friction between parents affect children?. What are the advantages to children of belonging to large families? 3. How can the Priesthood be honored by the mother? 4. Why is a sense of security so important to a child? 5- Discuss the value of having children earn money. IS] 575 6. Discuss the value of family councils wherein each member may express an opinion. 7- Show that co-operation among members of a family and sacrifice for each other is essential.
