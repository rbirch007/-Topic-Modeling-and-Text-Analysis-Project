Menus By the Day Or By the Week Phyllis Snow Home Service Director, Mountain Fuel Supply Company O you plan your menus by the meal, by the day, or by the week, and have your results been all that you would wish? Most homemakers find that planning for only one or two meals at a time is likely to result in poorly balanced menus, unnecessary rush and worry and extra shopping, and that money becomes ever scarcer as the end of the month draws ever nearer. Planning by the week has been found to be much mote satisfactory, especially in balancing menus. Some foods are needed every day, and some only three or four times a week. By looking at all seven days at once, we can be certain that all the necessities will be included. The seven-day plan helps the budget, too. Instead of serving chicken, steak, and chops soon after payday, as we are tempted to do when we plan by the day of meal, we shall find it easy to scatter these delicacies over the week, and thus keep up the family's interest in meals. Having a written market list saves time when we go to the store, for we can buy in one trip all of the staples, canned goods, and potatoes that we shall need during the week. Of course, menus are subject to change! All of us know that invitations out to dinner, unexpected Page 536 guests, or other emergencies may alter plans. But this need not be a problem. Perishables can be kept in the refrigerator. Even greens will keep garden fresh in the hydrator sections. Revisions in your meals can be easily made. Set aside a definite period of time for meal planning. This may require an hour or two if the meals are to be well-balanced from all standpoints, and, at the same time, kept within the bounds of your food allowance! Thursday or Friday is a good day in which to plan the menus, for you can start with the week-end meals, and any tidbits left from Sunday may be used to good advantage early in the week. It is easier to write out all seven breakfasts first and then to plan the dinners. Finally, balance each day's account nutritionally with the lunches or suppers. Menus should be simple, and it is well to keep in mind that tasty, nutritious food, spick-and-span cleanliness, attractive table settings, proper table manners, and pleasant conversation all contribute to a successful meal. It is the combination of these, rather than a series of "fancy dishes," that is important! To make your planning easy, and to be certain that all food essentials are included in your meals, try using MENUS BY THE DAY OR BY THE WEEK the following outlines which have been devised by leading authorities in the field of nutrition, medicine, and homemaking, and which have MINIMUM DAILY REQUIREMENTS 537 been accepted as being among the most vital contributions that have been made to good eating in recent years.

Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 5 Synopsis: Enid, wife of Tom Drage, who was killed in a factory accident, is faced with the problem of rearing her daughter Sharon. The factory makes a settlement, and Miss Nobbitt, the landlady, offers to take care of Sharon while Enid finishes the schooling required for a teacher's certificate. In Salt. Lake City, Enid registers at the University and begins her school work. She goes for a ride with Milo Ross, a fellow student. HE knew he was going to kiss her unless she acted swiftly. So, as his lips would have touched hers, she turned her head, at the same time pushing him from her with both hands. He tried to take her hands into his free one, as he said, "Don't tell me you�re going to be prudish. I like you." "If not letting you kiss me is being prudish, then I'm certainly going to be just that," she told him simply, flatly, "and if you don't mind I'd like to go home." There was that in her tone that told him she meant what she said. He straightened up, his mouth becoming sulkier than ever as he said, "Okay. You sound exactly like a school teacher." Her laugh was a little hysterical as she admitted, "I'm going to be a school teacher. And I'm glad of it. For that matter, I'm even glad that I give the impression of cramming, because I'm doing that, too. The sooner I finish, the sooner I can leave here and go home." Page 542 "There must be somebody very special waiting for you." "There is somebody very special," she assured him. He started the car and they drove toward town in silence. She found herself feeling just a little sorry for him, so wrapped was she in her own joy of thinking of the little town, Miss Nobbitt's large, old-fashioned house... And Sharon. Oh, yes, especially Sharon. The summer ended and Enid went home. The peaceful, uneventful weeks passed into months, and the months into another year, and Enid received her degree to teach. She put it carefully away in a bottom dresser drawer there to remain until the time would come when she and Sharon could go together to the red schoolhouse in the east part of town. The time passed so swiftly that that day came sooner than she had believed possible. Sharon's school started one Monday morning before the junior high school in which Enid was to teach. She had bought Sharon an adorable dress and hat for the occasion. It was an extravagance, but she wanted Sharon to look her very prettiest. Now, as she tied the large yellow sash and adjusted a golden yellow curl, she felt she had never seen anything more beautiful than this child of hers. But Sharon was frightened and a little dismayed. FAITH IS A HERITAGE "You'll stay there with me, won't you, Mommie?" she asked, her eyes dark and anxious. Enid told her, "I can't stay with you very long. But I will stay as long as possible. You mustn't be frightened, honey, most of the children are just little boys and girls that you know." "But there will be so many," the child lamented. Enid smiled, understanding that natural fear of great crowds. One or two people could always be met easily, but there was something about a group that made one feel alone and lonely. And Sharon was a shy little thing, anyway, sensitive and aloof. Enid had adjusted her own new hat at just the proper angle. She took Sharon's hand, and they started up the street together toward the schoolhouse, where the bell, high in the belfry, was already beginning to ring.   she entered the kindergarten room, especially when she saw that. The. Teacher was a young woman whom she had seen around town and who had always given her the impression of being proud and haughty. The impression was heightened when she introduced herself and Sharon. The girl glanced at the child, briefly, and, without looking directly at Enid, said, "She'll get along all night.". Enid asked, a bit hesitantly, "Is it all right if I stay a few moments?" "If you wish," she replied briefly. Then she told the child to be seated, and Enid walked to the back of the room where she found a chair and sat down. Her own legs shook just a little as 543. During the opening moments of the class, she caught Sharon looking around almost frantically for her, and she leaned forward smiling so that she would be in her line of vision. Unfortunately, Miss Hare, the teacher, saw, too, and a look of derision crossed her face. It was almost as though Enid could read her thoughts. She was probably thinking, Here is a spoiled youngster; they are poor, yet look at her clothes... AFTER a few moments, Miss Hare announced she would call the roll, and asked each child to raise his hand as his name was called. She started down the list. Sharon sat watching her, waiting for her name to be called. When the list was finished she put it aside, and still Sharon sat watching her, disappointed, still hoping that she would remember her mistake and call her name. But the teacher did not. Enid tried to tell herself that it was not deliberate, that it was unimportant and she wrinkled her nose at her daughter when she turned to her, trying to give assurance that it wasn't important. Later, Miss Hare asked how many of the children knew how to spell "cat." Sharon, among others, lifted her hand. When the teacher saw it, she said, "All right then, you, spell in Sharon stood up, looked about the room, and her face blanched. Enid could see her lower lip tremble as she tried to get the letters out and could not. Miss Hare turned from her to the board, saying sharply, sarcastically, 'I thought you knew how to spell 544 Sharon sat down and Enid felt as if she had been lashed with a cat-o'- nine-tails. Nothing in her own life had ever hurt her like this. Yet, she knew if she interceded, if she gave way to the emotions in her, it would be harder on Sharon than ever. The teacher would be even more unkind and Sharon would be more hurt. Enid decided to try and pass over the experience lightly, and to make Sharon believe there was some reason behind it, that the teacher was probably upset the first day, and was just thoughtless, that the slights didn't mean anything. But when Enid arrived home, she threw herself on the bed, and cried, bitterness and anger welling up in her. If ever she had a chance, she vowed, she would strike out against that kind of teaching. Sarcasm had no place in the handling of children... They were too fundamentally good, too untouched to be exposed to its sharp spears. Not only her own child deserved something better, but all children everywhere deserved to be treated with respect and kindness. Enid discovered to her amazement, when Sharon came home, that she seemed to have forgotten the incident. She quickly changed her clothes and ran outside to play with some neighbor children. They weren't the best-dressed nor the best-behaved children in town. Enid had had this truth brought home to her today when she had looked around the classroom and noticed the children from the homes on the east side of town. But what could she do? She had signed her contract now, and was bound to teach in this town. If she hadn't, she thought desperately, she would have left the town and never returned. After all, there was no one to bind her here.. Except Miss Nobbitt. But she really had been good to her, and she owed her a great deal. She would have to stay, of course. Things would work out. No one could know Sharon and not love her. Not even Miss Hare, Enid reflected hopefully. The next few days Enid was busy getting started with her own teaching. She felt a little shy among the carefree boys and girls she taught, who were at the age most difficult - to understand thirteen to fifteen years old some of them even sixteen. Yet, it had not been so very long since she had been that age herself. She could still remember the adjustments so difficult to make. She didn't believe young people were bad, fundamentally, only misunderstood, misdirected, and their only defense was youthful defiance. After the first few days, she was sure she was going to like teaching; she was sure that, on the whole, the children would be co-operative. Her thoughts were brought back to Sharon and to her teacher on a particular Friday when the child walked over to the high school building to meet her. "Hello," Enid greeted her happily as she saw her small figure in the doorway. "Come in. See the room where your mother teaches." The child walked in rather slowly, and Enid noticed the paleness of her face, the unhappy expression in her eyes. "What is it?" she asked, rising to reach her hand out to her, "Anything gone wrong?" FAITH IS A HERITAGE "No," Sharon said shortly, avoiding her mother's eyes, pretending to be interested in the blackboard beyond her. Enid didn't want to press the issue. She didn't want to put any ideas into her daughter's mind if none were there. She only asked casually, "How's school? Is Miss Hare nice?" She was unprepared for the sudden burst of tears, the fury of the words that came from the child. "No," she cried, sobbing, "she's mean. She says mean things to me. I don't like her, Mommie. She doesn't like me. She.. Doesn't.. 'like.. Me." The last was a heartbroken wail that held all the sorrow and misery of childhood. Enid felt a pain like a vise pressing within her breast. She gathered the child into her arms, feeling her own tears, her own anger rising to overflowing. But she kept silent until she was able to say, rather calmly, "I'm sure it isn't that bad. I'm sure she likes you. She is just gg busy, there are so many children.. Sharon shook her head in silent disagreement and Enid held her more tightly in her arms, as if, by doing so, she could protect her against anything that might ever hurt Sharon again. Enid wanted to cry out, but again she forced herself to say quietly, though she was trembling, "Why don't you take this dime and run over and get us a couple of ice-cream cones while I finish up here. Then, we'll walk home together." Sharon's face brightened momentarily as Enid dried her eyes, and in a moment she was off to the store. 545 That night when the child was asleep in her small bed, Enid sat in the lamplight, biting the end of a pen, staring at the white paper before her. Suddenly, the words seemed to start themselves and she began writing.. Swiftly.. Short, terse phrases... "I do not ask anything for my child that I do not ask for every child in the room.... The chance to be treated fairly.. An encouraging word for work well done..." She filled up the page, signed her name, folded it. Then she slipped it into an envelope, addressed it slowly, almost painfully. She wished there were some other way. She could go to the teacher in person, but she was afraid of her own emotions, afraid she would not be able to say what she wished to say. She sealed the envelope and set it beside the lamp where she would see it in the morning. Sometime, during the still hours, when the tears had spent themselves and she was staring into the darkness, it was almost as though a voice said to her, "Pray for those who despitefully use you." It seemed incredible to think of... To pray for Miss Hare with her haughtiness, her sharp tongue. Yet, as Enid thought of it, she was forced to admit that perhaps there was something back of it, some deep reason for her actions. Perhaps, it was a defense of some sort. How could one judge another.... Wise and gentle beyond her years, Enid closed her eyes and prayed for Miss Hare, prayed for her child. Prayed for wisdom for herself.

Dalton, President, Timpanogos Stake Relief Society  The Importance of Thrift (Continued from page 509) established themselves firmly and securely "in the midst of the Rocky Mountains." Thrift is rooted deeply in human life and reflects the character of a people. Personal discipline and personal sacrifice are necessary to a strong character. Relief for the unfortunate and those handicapped calls for a great emotion, and can be supplied only by those who work and save. The modern world has been beguiled into a false sense of security and, sooner or later, it must learn that no social device can take the place of thrifty habits, frugal living, and hard work, in making people economically secure and politically free and independent.  Night Callers (Continued from page 525) his speech lapsed into his native Shoshone. Turning, he summoned his braves to his side and ordered all his people to come to the great lodge. The lodge was a high, long tepee, covered with buffalo skins and filled, for decoration, with the heads of many animals. Nancy and her children were given the seat of honor beside the chief and his braves. The celebration began with a tribal dance. A young brave, dressed in brilliant scarlet and black, came into the center of the lodge. Thirty braves, painted and enveloped in beads and tiny bells, formed a large circle around him. At the sound of his drum, they all began moving in perfect unison. The dance was followed by a feast. Pumpkin, potatoes, corn, deer steaks, everything that the tribe had, was brought to Nancy, seated beside the chief. At the close of the feast, Nancy explained to her host her need for returning to her cabin in' the valley. Chief Many Feathers consented, and accompanied them down the mountain into the valley. They arrived at the door of the cabin just as the sun was slipping behind the peaks of the western mountains. As there were no wagon tracks in the soft, powdery earth, Nancy knew that Jim had not yet returned. At the door of the cabin, Chief Many Feathers stopped. Raising his arms, he removed a beautiful handwoven red, yellow, and blue blanket from around his broad shoulders. Stooping, he gently placed it around Nancy, and, for the first time, his face lost its stern look of noble dignity in a smile. He said, "Great Spirit of Shoshone children, keep evil one from wigwam of white princess." Nancy, unable to speak, grasped a hand of each of her children, and through her tears she watched the great chief swiftly climb the mountain path back to his people. LESSON Theology Church History Lesson I8 The Priesthood Quorums Expanded Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, November 5, 1946 Objective: To show that the worthy male membership of the Church is eligible to  STN my name they shall do many wonderful works," were the words of the Master to Joseph Smith and six elders assembled at Kirtland, Ohio, in September of the year 1832 (Doc. And Cov. 84:66). It was at this time that more light was thrown upon the Priesthood and its great powers and blessings for man. In my name they shall cast out devils; In my name they shall heal the sick; in my name they shall open the eyes of the blind, and unstop the ears of the deaf; And the tongue of the dumb shall speak; And if any man shall administer poison unto them it shall not hurt them. And the poison of a serpent shall not have power to harm them (Doc. And Cov. 84:67-72). Now, to note the next verse: But a commandment I give unto them; that they shall not boast themselves of these things, neither speak them before the world; for these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation. The Lord would give unto all his sons, who had become worthy, the power he himself possessed to perform great works. And to what end? To the end that all who sought him might profit and gain personal salvation. Here is true brotherhood. In the Lord's Church, the plan is to have members banned together fraternally as a devoted body, and to work out a personal salvation b actively striving for others. This means that each male member of the Church must be given an equal chance with all others to act officially in the name of the Lord in matters pertaining to gospel ordinances. Hence came the holy Priesthood. It is a known fact today in sociology, that for successful group cooperation, there must needs be an equality of privilege, at least in so far as membership rights are concerned. How such a principle has been applied to the lay membership of churches of the world today still begs for an answer. In matters of religious ordinance and ritual it is only the priests or ministers who have the opportunity to act for the group. To select the few who might be granted powers, can but leave the average church convert a_ passive bystander. He will but look in upon ways of serving the Lord. Page 55] receive the powers and blessings of the Priesthood.. 552 It was apparent from the very beginning of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that the Lord had "his friends" (Doc. And Cov. 84:77), all of them, joining hands in the great call to serve. Every worthy member of the Church might expect the call for leadership in the Priesthood. But the plan of the Priesthood, as divinely instituted, means more than just providing men with the opportunity to serve in positions of trust. As a mortal, man sooner or later must face the personal problems of life in an intimate way. Sickness strikes, and medical aid fails. Help must come from a higher source. Trouble comes, and one feels the need to seek divine guidance. A child arrives at the age of baptism. A father's natural hope is to desire the right to perform all these ordinances for the family members. In the true Church, these personal privileges of a sacred nature may be performed by any worthy father in Zion who bears the Priesthood of God and receives the authorization from the man who holds the keys. The Lord has provided in his Priesthood for individual satisfaction as well as group service. All worthy members may have the right to act in his name, from the head of the Church to the last ordained member. Training for an understanding of this concept begins early. Boys at the age of twelve are ordained to the lesser Priesthood after the order of Aaron, as deacons. In company with other members of his quorum, each boy is assigned to the temporal duties of the Church by his bishop. He collects fast offerings, helps keep the chapel and its grounds attractive, serves on welfare projects, passes the Lord's sacrament at meetings, and responds to many other worthwhile assignments. These are duties all deacons can perform. For those in the quorum who show leadership, the call comes to serve as president, counselors, or secretary. While such offices require more responsibility, they do not add any additional rights to the office of a deacon which the least member in - the quorum holds. Not many years pass before a boy ordained as a deacon may be advanced to a teacher, and then to a priest which office is the highest in the lesser Priesthood. Within each of these callings are certain added responsibilities. These quicken a youth's religious convictions and function in his life because they provide him with activities that are of positive worth to his fellow quorum members and his Church. When the time arrives that a boy comes to the estate of young manhood, he may, through his worthiness, be advanced to the office of an elder. This calling sets him apart as a holder of the higher Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, the great high priest who lived during the days of Abraham, and to whom Abraham came to pay tithes and offerings. The higher Priesthood bears the name of Melchizedek by express command for the purpose of avoiding the constant use of its real name, the Holy Priesthood of the Order of the Son of God. It is to this order that all worthy adult male members of the Church belong. Only special callings within this Priesthood set men apart as LESSON DEPARTMENT presidents, members of the Quorum of the Twelve, Seventies, etc. Every worthy father in Israel has the knowledge of the right this Priesthood gives him to administer to the sick, conduct a sacrament service for his family (if he lives apart from an organized ward or branch of the Church), and to teach his children the way of life with conviction as to his authoritative right to teach. In fact, such powers of the Priesthood as are given to all worthy members of the Lord's Church are so inclusive as to be the way of all life and good living both for here and hereafter. Once the full significance of the great plan of brotherhood, brought about through the function of the Priesthood, became clear to the members of the Church, the steady and enduring growth of God's kingdom upon earth was assured. It was as though the Lord had scattered abroad the good seeds of life which he knew would root and grow into the individual testimonies of thousands and thousands of saints. Today, throughout the world, Priesthood quorums are expanding. The pattern of these organizations has been so clearly marked and tested through the hundred years of growth that wherever groups of people come together and embrace 553 the faith there can be set up, immediately, the order of the Priesthood to provide the foundation and framework of the plan of life that builds character into the lives of boys and men. / These are the basic principles upon which the Lord, who is "no respecter of persons" (Acts 10:34), has builded his great Church in our day, until now, we no longer talk in terms of personalities and the personal drama of stirring events such as were known in the tender years of the little flock "who heard and believed the Prophet Joseph"; rather have we come to measure our strength in areas scattered over the face of the earth where our stakes, and our Priesthood quorums by the thousands, now exist. Yet beneath all these figures there still rests the simplicity of the gospel principle of brotherhood, upon which all great things are builded.
