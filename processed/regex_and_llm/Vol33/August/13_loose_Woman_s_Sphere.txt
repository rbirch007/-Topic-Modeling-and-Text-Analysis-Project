Woman's Sphere Romana W. Cannon MIs CHARLOTTE KNIGHT, former Utahn, was one of the reporters among the distinguished group who, from circling giant airships, observed the historic atom bomb destruction at Bikini atoll. The tests made there will help to shape our country's future naval and air policies. Miss Knight has made an exceptional career for herself in New York as a public relations worker, a war correspondent, and a staff member of the technical Air Force Magazine, which she represented in the Bikini tests. HE modern woman is not so modern after all. In the fifth century B. C., the Greek dramatist, Sophocles, wrote of... Egypt's evil ways Where men indoors sit weaving at the loom, And wives outdoors must earn their daily bread. HE fighting Chilean, Don Tancredo Pinochet, who has been 'working against corruption and injustice in Chile for forty years, is married to an American woman, the former Constance Alexander, while Spruille Braden, former American ambassador to the Argentine, and present Assistant Secretary of State, is married to a beautiful South American woman, born in Chile. "THERE is no more excellent tribute to a woman's character than to be greatly beloved in her own family circle. Such a love existed between the gifted composer Felix Mendelssohn and his sister Fanny. Grief over Fanny's death hastened Felix's own premature demise. One of the truest and most devoted friends of the great South American liberator, Simon Bolivar, was his sister, Maria Antonia. MBE:. Marjorie D. Spikes, first woman attache to be appointed by the British Government, came to the British Embassy in Washington last October. She reports that in one year, 116,000 families have been rehoused in London. Many, however, are still sleeping in the underground railway system hostels. Though food rationing is still no better than in war days, children are in better health than in 1939. Each child has one pint of milk a day, however great the shortage. If people are unable to pay for the milk, the Government provides it. The National Youth Council trains leaders who go throughout Britain looking after the youth, with a consequent sharp decline in juvenile delinquency. About one-third of the Kingdom's city councilors are women, who are achieving excellent results in the improvement of civic affairs, frequently without compensation. Page 533 EDITORIAL 9 VOL. 33 AUGUST 1946 Personal Development Through Service "He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward" (Doc. And Cov. 59:23). OVER half of the Relief Society membership is engaged in service to the organization either as ward or stake officers, or as visiting teachers. These women have, for the most part, accepted their callings without thought of the personal development they would gain, but have entered into their work with zeal and enthusiasm, thinking only of ways and means to further the progress of the Relief Society. However, the Lord has promised us that: "He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward," and all who work in the Relief Society benefit not only the Church, but themselves as well. Every one of us has potential abilities and talents, just as she has potential physical strength in her body. If the arms and legs are never used, the potential physical strength is undeveloped. Just so, if one does not use her special abilities and talents, they cannot be expected to develop and be of use to others. The women who work in Relief Society find many ways and opportunities to develop, because the program is so wide and varied. In general, these women develop spiritually and mentally, and they acquire many homemaking skills. Specifically, Relief Society women develop their talents according to their callings, as for example, the women occupying executive Page 534 positions. These women gain confidence and poise and the ability to stand before large gatherings and conduct meetings according to accepted procedure. Who in all the Relief Society gains as much from the lesson as the class leader herself? Many times, the teacher has taught herself a more valuable lesson than that received by the class members. The work meeting, the participation of Relief Society in the Welfare Program, the visiting teaching program, the Singing Mothers all furnish a wide variety of opportunities for self-service. Many times Relief Society sisters have been called to fill positions for which they felt inadequate and unqualified. However, these women have been magnified in their callings and made equal to the tasks before them. Later, these women have borne testimony to the development they, personally, received as they performed the duties, which they had felt were far beyond their capabilities. While Relief Society women do not accept positions for the personal advancement they may receive therefrom, yet we do recognize that great development comes to them, and are thankful that this is one of the rewards for them "who doeth the works of righteousness."
