Personal Development Through Service "He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward" (Doc. And Cov. 59:23). OVER half of the Relief Society membership is engaged in service to the organization either as ward or stake officers, or as visiting teachers. These women have, for the most part, accepted their callings without thought of the personal development they would gain, but have entered into their work with zeal and enthusiasm, thinking only of ways and means to further the progress of the Relief Society. However, the Lord has promised us that: "He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward," and all who work in the Relief Society benefit not only the Church, but themselves as well. Every one of us has potential abilities and talents, just as she has potential physical strength in her body. If the arms and legs are never used, the potential physical strength is undeveloped. Just so, if one does not use her special abilities and talents, they cannot be expected to develop and be of use to others. The women who work in Relief Society find many ways and opportunities to develop, because the program is so wide and varied. In general, these women develop spiritually and mentally, and they acquire many homemaking skills. Specifically, Relief Society women develop their talents according to their callings, as for example, the women occupying executive Page 534 positions. These women gain confidence and poise and the ability to stand before large gatherings and conduct meetings according to accepted procedure. Who in all the Relief Society gains as much from the lesson as the class leader herself? Many times, the teacher has taught herself a more valuable lesson than that received by the class members. The work meeting, the participation of Relief Society in the Welfare Program, the visiting teaching program, the Singing Mothers all furnish a wide variety of opportunities for self-service. Many times Relief Society sisters have been called to fill positions for which they felt inadequate and unqualified. However, these women have been magnified in their callings and made equal to the tasks before them. Later, these women have borne testimony to the development they, personally, received as they performed the duties, which they had felt were far beyond their capabilities. While Relief Society women do not accept positions for the personal advancement they may receive therefrom, yet we do recognize that great development comes to them, and are thankful that this is one of the rewards for them "who doeth the works of righteousness."
