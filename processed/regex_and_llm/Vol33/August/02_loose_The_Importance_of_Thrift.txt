The Importance of Thrift Elder Alma Sonne Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles HE Church, functioning and operating through its members, is the most effective character building agency in the world. It has always stood for night living and constructive thinking in all the phases of human life. It stands for intellectual, moral, and _ spiritual progress. Its aim is to strengthen the security, the happiness, and the independence of every home, and to protect the family against fallacious doctrines, subversive tendencies, and destructive forces that now threaten the stability of organized society. The family is the unit of everyday life. It is the moral, spiritual, and economic unit. Every stimulation and encouragement should be given to upbuild and protect the family and the home. Twenty-five hundred years ago the Greek, Socrates, told his students they would be happier if they would study the problems of the home and such fundamental things as thrift, industry, and the wise management of the family income. Surely, a measure of financial independence is as precious and important to men and women as political independence. It is worth all the striving and sacrifice necessary for its achievement. Much of the unhappiness in the world is due to poor economics, selfish pleasures, and thoughtless indulgences. An easy, carefree life, without purpose and plan, will undermine character and weaken the moral fiber of men and women. It has been said that Charles Dickens regarded the parable of the prodigal son as the most beautiful story in all literature. It is not difficult to picture the wayward son re. Turning to his home, disillusioned and thoroughly repentant. He had "wasted his substance with riotous living." Worse still, he had wasted his life and dissipated his powers. Therein lay the tragedy of a spendthrift's life. Haphazard use of time, money, and energy means a poor return and is devoid of satisfaction. Devotion to a purposeful plan calls for strength and determination, and lays the foundation for a well-ordered, independent life. A thrifty person looks ahead; he practices self control and prepares for emergencies that may arise. He faces life with a positive, self-reliant attitude and seeks to fit himself for an opportunity when it comes. Abraham Lincoln's life began in a wretched home amid poverty and discouragements. By sheer determination and a resolute spirit, he overcame, what appeared to be, an insurmountable handicap. He was motivated always by a strong desire to go forward and to improve his condition. All through his life he exemplified the principles of thrift and hard work, preparing carefully and thoughtfully for future responsibilities. In doing so, he gained Page 507 508 strength and wisdom, and thus fortified himself to withstand the forces which were conspiring against him. Nowhere is thrift more important than in the home. Nowhere are the consequences of extravagance and waste more destructive of human happiness. Ordinarily, the proper management of a home is a full-time job. It calls for wisdom, determination, and __ perseverance. The mother who neglects the home to augment the family income or to engage in futile amusements and social pastimes, frequently does so at a great cost and a sacrifice of family solidarity. It is estimated that seventy- -five per cent of the family income is spent either directly or indirectly by the housewife. This expenditure covers items which are essential to the happiness and well-being of the entire family. Any plan that will be helpful in solving the domestic problem of income and outgo is worthy of careful thinking and thorough consideration. To devise and to put into successful operation such a plan offers a challenge to the wisest and most businesslike household. The prudent and conscientious homemaker will welcome any suggestion that will strengthen the family economics. A budget is a financial plan by which the spending and investment of money is controlled. Its purpose is to avoid loose, thoughtless, and wasteful methods. It deals with such items as food, clothing, shelter, doctor bills, amusement, charity, insurance, savings, contributions, and many others that come up for consideration in a family. Adherence to a budget probably means a greater effort, a more frugal fare, and a severe discipline; but it also means a sense of security and worthiness, a conservation of resources, and a step towards a prosperous and productive life, and, certainly, a step away from vice, luxury, and ostentation. Calvin Coolidge, who had a reputation for frugality and thrift, speaking to a gathering of newspapermen, made the following statement: Extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of labor. I favor the policy of economy, not because I wish to save money, but because I wish to save people. Every dollar that we carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager. Every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so much the more abundant. Thrift, in its broadest sense, consists of the efficient and productive direction of one's energies. It enters into every field of honorable endeavor. The artist who paints a picture employs thrifty habits, for he builds upon something he has already achieved. The housewife who patiently and methodically adds comfort and attractiveness to the home practices thrift. So does the farmer who plants, cultivates, fertilizes, and increases the productivity of his fields. There is no progress without thrift. It is the cornerstone of our entire industrial life. The old-fashioned economic virtues are as sound today as they were when the pioneers laid the foundations of all we have and are. They are fundamentally and _ essentially progressive, and point the way to a better and a more satisfying life. THE IMPORTANCE OF THRIFT EXTRAVAGANCE is misdirected and wasted energy. It is the road that leads to poverty and disappointment. It undermines character and robs one of the power to proceed safely and constructively. It is a source of embarrassment and discomfiture, and frustrates all] plans and purposes for better living and a more comfortable existence. It comes from a craving for things to which people are not entitled until they have worked and saved to provide such enjoyment and possession. There is no grander spectacle in the world than that of a husband and wife girding their loins for the battle of life, all barriers crumbling before them. To them belong the fruits of honest labor and persistent effort.. Waste in any form is an enemy to the individual, the home, and the nation. Brigham Young said: Let nothing go to waste. Never consider that you have bread enough around you to suffer your children to waste a crust or a crumb of it. If a man is worth millions of bushels of wheat and corn, he is not wealthy enough to suffer his servant girl to sweep a single kernel of it into the fire. Remember it, do not waste anything, but take care of everything. Such was the economic philosophy of the great pioneer colonizer whose wisdom and leadership subdued deserts, built towns and cities, and established a thriving commonwealth. But, above all things, Brigham Young was anxious to preserve the stability of the home. Waste and extravagance have wrecked homes and brought despair and misery to many families, Too many young people, as they assume the responsibility of home- 509 making, insist on beginning married life with all the comforts and conveniences of their parental home. They fail to take into consideration the long struggle and the frugal habits which have made possible the establishment and maintenance of that home. Often the parents are too indulgent with children and permit them to set up standards and to form habits far beyond their power and ability to sustain. The excessive use of the family automobile has lured many a youth away from the path of industry and duty. Extravagant tastes in the matter of food, clothing, amusements, and such other demands as clever advertising  promotes, have been allowed to develop without regard for the welfare and security of home and family. Frequently, a selfish desire and an unworthy ambition to outflaunt neighbors and friends, regardless of the means at one's disposal, are back of many ill-advised and unnecessary expenditures. National thrift is a bulwark against chaos and disintegration. It begins in the homes of the people, for no nation can rise above the stability, the integrity, the sanctity, and the coherence of its family group. Whatever perils the family, perils the nation. The laws of progress and growth are eternal. The pioneers survived because they were thrifty and industrious. They developed the virtue to struggle and wait and to possess their souls in patience. They looked ahead and made provisions for the future. Sometimes their rations were short and their food very simple, but they battled on against want and misery, and finally (Continued on page 550)
