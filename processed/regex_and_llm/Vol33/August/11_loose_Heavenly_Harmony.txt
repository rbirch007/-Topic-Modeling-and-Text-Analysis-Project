Heavenly Harmony Rachel B. Ballantyne Do you ever stop and think how much the heavenly bodies the sun, moon, and stars are like a family of people? As they perform their work so faithfully and undeviatingly, they seem to be giving a silent lesson, day after day, as to how people could live and conduct their lives in order to have peace and harmony in their homes. If we could catch the lesson so beautifully portrayed above us, it would ensure happiness to the inmates of our earthly homes. Let us call the sun the father. He rises first in the morning, looks over the mountains, and sends a smile of radiance over this beautiful world of ours, then mounts the sky in power and splendor and, from his high vantage, sees and touches every detail of his responsible work, which is a mighty factor in keeping our world productive that life may exist hereon. In the evening, his work finished, he retires to rest. Then the moon, we'll call the mother, a dainty, silver rim, appears and calls her star children out to play and twinkle. After games, she retires. But each evening she returns, stays a little longer, that her influence and activity may give added light and effectiveness until she is full and glorious in gold and silver splendor, soaring and reigning queen of the night. Then, as she begins to weary, her triumphal beauty wanes, little by little, until she retires into a natural period of rest, away from public gaze. The star children are left to light the traveler's way and do their part in dispelling darkness, and to carry on in shining loveliness, for a season, alone. Thus, each planet and each orb has its opportunity in making this the grand old world it is. The father's task is much the same, day after day, carrying on in unwavering strength. The mother's work is more varied, but not less important in the plan. In all nature, as in the gospel plan, harmony prevails, giving each creation a place and a responsibility. Page 53]
