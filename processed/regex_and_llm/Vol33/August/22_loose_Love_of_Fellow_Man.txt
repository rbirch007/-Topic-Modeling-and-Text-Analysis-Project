Love of Fellow Man President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, November 5, 1946 Objective: To show that the pioneers possessed the qualities of character necessary to live the "second great commandment," love of neighbor. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, and who is my neighbor? (Luke 10:25-29). |e made answer by giving the parable of the good Samaritan, thus indicating that all men are neighbors to each other and should render unselfish and helpful service to their fellow men. After thus describing the unselfish service of the good Samaritan, he then said to the lawyer, "Go, and do thou likewise." It takes real strength of character as well as unselfishness to be neighborly and charitable in the broad sense which Jesus thus taught and thus emphasized. This doctrine is so strong and includes so much self-giving and self-sacrifice that living it strictly is a real test of strength. Church history, as well as the pioneer stories which have come down to us, testify to the neighborliness, co-operation, and true charity practiced by the Mormon pioneers.   Because of their common experiences, their common needs, and their common problems, they could well understand the inward feelings and desires, the hardships, sufferings, and heartaches of one another. They therefore sacrificed and shared together, they comforted one another, and thus helped to carry one another's burdens. In their preparation for the great western march and especially during the journey the pioneers traded and loaned their scant belongings, they divided and shared whatever they had in the way of food, clothing, bedding, and other supplies. One of the rules they adopted was, "Every man is to put as much interest in taking care of his brother's cattle as he would his own. And no man will be indulged in idleness." In those companies where space in the wagons for passengers was limited, and when there was hard pulling for the animals, in whatever wagons there was space, preference was given to little children, the aged, and those who were ill. After they reached the Valley, their co-operative efforts continued, and the stupendous work they accomplished in the first years was the result of their unselfishness; and LESSON DEPARTMENT the fraternal spirit that united and held them closely together, added to the spiritual guidance with which they were blessed. After the newcomers arrived, arrangements were soon made for their temporary employment. Public works were established on the temple block, 555 including shops for carpenters, blacksmiths, machinists, and others. In this way many received their first start in life in Utah. Thus, through their co-operation and neighborliness, they grew in understanding, unselfishness, benevolence, and brotherly love.
