THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE FOR THE COMING NIGHT Grace Sayre Here in the shadow of the hill, I watch a lone star, white and still, On the cool bosom of the lake. _ I hear the whispering winds that shake A willow's lace above its breast... The pool is broken from its rest. The star is scattered into quills That tremble with the pool's small thrills. The voice of water singing low, The cool, sweet winds that come and go, All these the pictured pool, the lace Of. Willows lend enchanted grace; Serenest peace is on the land, The star, pool-bound, puts forth a hand And with slim fingers, shapes the light? A taper for the coming night. The Cover: "The Peace Rose" from a photograph by W. Ray Hastings VOL. 33, NO. 6 JUNE by Grace O. Danie: MEMORY GROVE IN SUMMER, SALT LAKE CITY
