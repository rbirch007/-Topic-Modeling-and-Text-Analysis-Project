MY FATHER Jennie Pyper Johnson For Fathers' Day, June 16 I touched his feet, his aching feet That have trodden the narrow way, And I thought of the weary steps They had taken to reach today; I kissed his hands, his toil-worn hands That have known the feel of the sod, And thought of the seeds he planted In fellowship with God. I saw his face, his careworn face, Lined deep with the mark of the years; I saw the love that lighted the way Through the smiles as well as the tears. I heard him pray in humbleness? As good men pray for their own, And I knew that on the path of life He never had walked alone; He may be listed as common clay Along the path he has trod, And yet he ever holds a place With the noblemen of God. Photograph by Grace O. Tuttle The Settlement of Sanpete Valley Leda Thompson Jensen Former Member, Relief Society General Board PART I HE early history of Sanpete Valley is closely associated with the Ute Indians, a tribe of the Shoshone family, who claimed this rich Valley as their own before the white men came. From these Indians the names Sanpete and Sanpitch are derived. June 14, 1849, not quite two years after the first company of pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley, a delegation of Ute Indians accompanied Chief Walker to Salt Lake City to visit Brigham Young, with the request that settlers be sent to the valley of the Sanpitch River to teach the Indians to build houses and till the soil. "HIGH COUNTRY  The valley to which Chief Walker led an exploring party of four men, Joseph Horn, W. W. Phelps, Ira Willes, and D. B. Huntington, lay about a hundred miles south of Salt Lake City in the center of Utah. It was five thousand to six thousand feet above sea level, with the Wasatch Mountains to the east, the Sanpitch Mountains to the west, and the Sanpitch River flowing from north to south through the valley. The Indians treated the four men royally, and, after exploring the natural resources, they returned to report that everything was favorable for founding a colony. A company of about fifty families from Salt Lake City THE PLATEAU EAST OF SANPETE VALLEY Page  COUNTY COURTHOUSE, MANTI, UTAH Lake City and Centerville was organized and started for Sanpete Valley. They traveled due south to Salt Creek Canyon, the pass which connects Juab with Sanpete County. They cleared roads, built bridges, and successfully passed through the Canyon. Then they moved on to the present site of Manti, Utah. November 22, 1849, the first camp was made on the banks of the creek that flowed out of the canyon to the east. Wagon boxes were used as temporary homes. In a few days it began to snow, and it snowed almost continually until the ground was covered to a 'depth of three or four feet. The winter was very severe. The settlers moved from City Creek to the south side of the hill on which the Manti Temple now stands. Some of the families lived in dugouts. Two babies, born one January night, were wrapped in a large cowhide to keep them from freezing to death. After the camp had been made in readiness for winter, a company of twelve men, under the command of Jerome Bradley, returned to Salt Lake City for supplies. On the return trip, the supply wagons were halted in Provo because of Indian trouble and, when they reached Salt Creek Canyon in January, they were unable to get through the snow. Men on snowshoes with hand-drawn sleds made their way from Manti to the snowbound wagons over drifts eight to twenty feet deep. Many trips were made until the supplies were removed. The wagons were not able to get through the Canyon and reach Manti until the last day of March 18so. The men and boys were kept busy most of the time shoveling away the snow to bare the grass for feed for the cattle. Only 113, of the 240 head of cattle brought with them, were alive the following June; and only one team of horses had THE SETTLEMENT OF SANPETE VALLEY strength enough to pull a plow. The Indians camped around the colony and devoured the dead animals to keep from starving. Then came spring, and on the evening after the first warm day, the hissing of hundreds of rattlesnakes startled the colonists. Gliding from holes in the mountain, from under the rocks and the shelter of evergreens and shrubs, they writhed and wiggled about in beds, boxes, and cupboards, They attacked the horses and cattle. With the aid of pine-knot torches, the settlers united in warfare against them. One of the brethren killed thirty in one day. Nearly five hundred were killed in one night. The camp was finally rid of the reptiles. The most remarkable thing about the whole SHEEP ON SUMMER RANGE IN SANPETE COUNTY 375 incident was the fact that not one person was bitten. With the coming of spring, the land was plowed, seeds were planted, and, soon, fresh vegetables were available. The soil Proved very productive, and ditches were dug from the creek to irrigate the land. Notwithstanding his pleadings for white neighbors, Chief Walker frequently tried to stir up trouble. Had it not been for an aged, diplomatic chief, Soweitte, the inhabitants of Manti might have been massacred that first winter. Early attempts to make settlements at Spring City, Mount Pleasant, and Ephraim, north of Manti, failed, due to the depredations of the Indians who forced the venturesome pioneers back Manti, to the fort at 376 were made upon the settlements, cattle and horses were stolen, guards were killed and scalped, herders and wood haulers were attacked. The only flour mill in the Valley, located at the mouth of Manti Canyon, was burned after the miller and guard had been slain. The drivers of four teams of oxen hauling grain to Salt Lake were killed, the sacks were cut open, and the grain scattered and wasted. These incidents could be multiplied many times if all the hostile deeds of the Indians were related. The most bitter Indian trouble in Utah was centered in Sanpete County, with the Indians carrying on their depredations as far north as Payson in Utah County, and south to Richfield in Sevier County. Walker incited his braves to constantly harass the settlers from 1852 until his death in 1855. This period of warfare was known as the Walker War. Arropine, the brother of Walker, professed much love for the Latter-day Saints, and, as evidence of his friendship, deeded the entire County of Sanpete to Brigham Young for the benefit of the Church. The Indians saw their lands being taken from them. Land to an Indian is his means of livelihood, his wealth. At this time, also, the government was urging that the Indians be placed on reservations. Undoubtedly, these two factors combined, placed the Indians on the defensive and a number of incidents precipitated the worst Indian outbreak in Utah, which lasted three years (1865-1868) and was known as the Black Hawk War. The area of greatest conflict was centered in Sanpete and Sevier Counties. Small bands of Indians, twenty-five to one hundred in number, constantly harassed the settlements, taking the lives of at least seventy people, destroying thousands WHEAT FIELD IN "THE GRANARY OF UTAH" THE SETTLEMENT OF SANPETE VALLEY of dollars worth of property, and forcing an expenditure of $1,121,037 by the Territory of Utah. The help of the militia of the Territory and of United States Indian agents was necessary before a treaty was concluded by General Morrow of the United States Army at Mt. Pleasant, September 7, 1872. After this, the Indians were placed on reservations provided and maintained by the Government of the United States. In August 1850, President Brigham Young visited the first settlement in Sanpete, named it Manti, after a notable Book of Mormon city, and the county, Sanpete, after the Indian tribe inhabiting the -Valley, whose chief was Sanpitch. February 6, 1851, Manti was made a city by act of the Legislature, and, on February 3, 1852, a bill passed the Legislature creating Sanpete County. After the Walker War, settlements were made at suitable places in the County, the first successful attempt being made in the early spring of 1854, when Reuben W. Allred and fifteen families from Manti moved seven miles north to Pine Creek, the present site of Ephraim. Sporadic uprisings of the Indians made the building of a fort necessary, and the homes were built inside the enclosure. It was not until 1860, that the residents left the fort and erected homes on their city lots. The first two years in the history of Ephraim were days of trials and disappointments, which none but the most determined men and women could endure. The Indians were not the only source of dread and anxiety. A frost killed the first 377 crop of grain, and grasshoppers destroyed almost every other species of vegetation. The settlers men, women, and children fought day and night to rid the land of millions of grasshoppers which devoured everything they could. In 1857, a bountiful harvest encouraged and heartened those hardy pioneers, and the granaries were filled to overflowing with wheat. It was demonstrated that the climate and soil of Sanpete County were well adapted for the growing of grain, and, so bounteous were the harvests, that Brigham Young called the County, "The Granary of Utah." Most of the agricultural lands in the County required irrigation, which led to this science being thoroughly developed by the Sanpete pioneers. In the early sixties, thousands of bushels of grain went from Sanpete across the plains to feed the immigrant trains. Sanpete became an agricultural county of small holdings in farm property. Stock and sheep raising became supplementary industries. In the Production of wool and mutton, Sanpete County at one time lead not only the counties of Utah but all the counties of the entire United States. In March of 1859, Mt. Pleasant and Spring City were resettled and new colonies were begun at Moroni and Gunnison. In August and October of the same year, the sites for Fountain Green and Fairview were located and settled. In December of 1857, Bishop John E. Reese and Chief Tabinan discovered the first coal in Utah in the Sanpitch Mountains west of the (Continued on page 407) Women Poets in Review Anna Boss Hart Member, Relief Society General Board PART II MILY Elizabeth Dickinson? how well I remember the hour at Columbia University when I heard Martha Dickinson Bianchi review the life of Emily Dickinson. Lt was a hot afternoon studies were crowding me but I wanted to hear the niece of Emily Dickinson review the life of her noted relative. We sat in awe as Madame Bianchi entered the room, dressed in black and wearing a huge corsage of pink roses. How different from the delicate white flower Emily Dickinson ?her subject. Emily Dickinson, our distinguished American lyrist, whose poems number some fifteen hundred in all, wrote no prose except some remarkable letters which were published after her death. Her poems, always short and full of the most elevated and ideal thoughts, achieved unexpected popularity after her death and had, strange to say, a wider circulation than those of any contemporary poet. Only two of her poems were published during her lifetime. She was called "the modern Sappho," "a hermit thrush," "a New England nun'?this poet born in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1830. Her father, Edward Dickinson, of an old Massachusetts family, was the leading lawyer of the town, served a term in Congress as a Whig, and was treasurer of Amherst College Page 378 which his father had founded. It is said of him that once he rang a fire bell furiously so that nobody would miss seeing a sunset. Emily attended Amherst Academy, spent one year at South Hadley Female Seminary, visited Washington and Philadelphia for a few weeks while her father was in Congress, was treated for eye trouble in Boston for part of 1864 and 186s, and died at fifty-five of Bright's disease. That is the record of her outward life. It is the least important thing about her. It would be interesting to write of Emily Dickinson's home, to tell about her family and the community of Amherst. Emily Dickinson, for twenty years, never went farther than her garden gate, saw no one but her family and a few chosen friends, dressed always in white, choosing the gardenia as her favorite flower. She wrote her poems secretly on scraps of paper, rolled and tied them with a thread, and thrust them into bureau drawers. Her personality was alive. There was an infinite sweetness in her voice, which was low and tensely appreciative. Her alert curiosity was a part of life that was youth and magic. She wrote of her environment as she grew to know it, step by step, discovery by discovery, truth by truth? until time merely became eternity. To her, nothing was mean or trivial, WOMEN POETS IN REVIEW and her "fainting robin" became a "synonym of the universe." She is appreciated by the unpoetic, the busy person, the young and old, the school girl and the poet. She is quoted in sermon and in conversation. Dr. John Erskine considered "It's All I Have to Bring Today" as one of Emily Dickinson's most perfect poems: It's all I have to bring today, This, and my heart beside, This, and my heart, and all the fields, And all the meadows wide; Be sure you count, should I forget, Someone the sum could tell, This, and my heart, and all the bees Which in the clover dwell. Here is another example of an exquisite lyric: I dreaded that first robin so, But he is mastered now, And I'm accustomed to him grown, He hurts a little, though. Emily Dickinson's implicit faith is shown in this one: I never spoke with God, Nor visited in Heaven; Yet certain am I of the spot As if the chart were given. Emily Dickinson was one of the American poets of her century who treated the great lyric themes of love and faith with entire candor and sincerity. "Valor in the dark she acknowledged as her Maker's code." There are many other women poets who have made a place for themselves in the last century. Some are living and some have passed beyond, but their poetry will sing on. 379 EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY PNA St. Vincent Millay, one of the most brilliant lyrists, was born in Rockland, Maine, February 22, 1892. She is known for her fine imaginative powers, for her sensitiveness to beauty. There is a rare whimsical quality in her poems. Many of her poems echo a response in our souls. "God's World" and her longer poem "Renascence," one of her earliest long poems, are full of unworldly ecstasy. ""Renascence" was written when Miss Millay was nineteen and it brought her name into prominence as one to be reckoned with in the field of lyric poetry. Do you know Adelaide Crapsey, another American poet, and the originator of the "cinquain"? She did most of her work in the last three or four months of her life. She died 380 early, a victim of tuberculosis. Seriously ill for over a year, she knew that her death was only a question of time, but she faced the situation with courage, and with a grim humor. This is one of her cinquains: Triad These be Three silent things: The falling snow. Before the dawn.. Just dead... The hour. The mouth of one Anguish Keep thou Thy tearless watch All night, but when blue dawn Breathes on the silver moon, then weep! Then weep! One could not mention women's names in poetry without naming Amy Lowell who is regarded as the chief American exponent of free verse. Amy Lowell was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, February 9, 1874, and was educated in the private schools of her native State. No biographical presentation of her would be complete without including the statement that her genealogical tree includes the name of James Russell Lowell, the poet. There have been many kinds of nature poets, but none exactly like Miss Lowell. She is the poet of that nature which is the product of landscape gardening. We can easily imagine ourselves in old secluded gardens, with fountains and statues and marble steps. "Patterns" comes to our minds, and other examples of colors, scents, and textures. SARA TEASDALE. ARA Teasdale is almost the direct opposite in poetry from the style of Amy Lowell. She was born in St. Louis, Mission, in 1884, and was educated in private schools in her home city. For the first time in the history of Columbia University a prize of $500 was presented for poetry and to Sara Teasdale for her volume of Love Songs poems of true lyric quality. Her lyrics do have subtle and beautiful word music, simplicity, and brevity. A number of her poems have been translated into French, Spanish, Danish, and other languages. It is no wonder that many of her poems have been set to music. They are pure lyrics. Spring Night The park is filled with night and fog, The veils are drawn about the world, The drowsy lights along the paths Are dim and pearled. WOMEN POETS IN REVIEW We love "Barter", which begins her Love Songs, and we remember "The Coin" and "Stars." She said about her own poems, "For me, one of the greatest joys of poetry is to know it by heart." Lizette Woodworth Reese is another American poet we must remember. Her work has an exquisite and serene distinction, a feminine tenderness we love. We must not forget poems like "A Christmas Folk Song" and her famous sonnet "Tears." -.. Make me see aright How each has back what once he stayed to weep: Homer his sight, David his little lad! And now we should mention in review a score of other poets who have found a place in the hearts of hundreds of people. Elinor Wylie has given us four books of poems, of which the last, Angels and Earthly Creatures, should especially be known. Marguerite Wilkinson, from Canada, has left her contributions and has introduced to us many new friends in New Voices. Another whose work is of exquisite technique and charming fancy is Grace Hazard Conklin, bom in New York City, and author of Afternoons of April and Wilderness Songs. Angela Morgan has stimulated her readers with her fervor and optimism. We should enjoy again Forward, March! Katherine Lee Bates has won her place in the hearts of hundreds of people through her poem "America the Beautiful." Americal Americal God shed his grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea! 331 There is a certain quaint "otherworldliness" about the poetry of Anna Hempstead Branch, a poet from Connecticut. Her prize-winning poem was "The Road 'Twixt Heaven and Hell." Josephine Preston Peabody Marks obtained the Stratford Avon prize in 1910 with The Piper. One of her lyrics of love is "The House and the Road." The little Road says, Go, The little House says, Stay: And O, it's bonny here at home, But I must go away. Today, Grace Noll Crowell and a host of others express notes of poetry often echoed in the hearts of readers. Doesn't this last stanza of "Recompense" express a satisfaction which life gives us? I never have been where the mountains stand, Majestic, aloof, apart, But nightly, the infinite, star-crowned heights Speak to my waiting heart, And mine are the winds that are mountain-born, And of seas, they are a part. And so the procession goes on and on these women poets in review. This is but a sampling of women poets in the world of literature. Those women of the Orient, those inspired Hebrew women, have not been mentioned. How interesting it would be to pause and greet our Latter-day Saint women who poured out their souls in song through the years. Let us enjoy these women poets we have greeted. Let us delve into the greatest and most universal thoughts with the greatest of women poets.
