A Compliment for Mom Olive W. Burt (This story relates another episode in the lives of the adopted children, Janet and Stevie. JANET, seeing that baby Carol J was asleep, wheeled the pram into the yard and around the house to her favorite spot under the apple tree. She placed the pram carefully, so that the baby would be protected from the direct rays of the early summer sun, and yet could benefit by the slight breeze that stirred the branches overhead. Then she flung herself on the grass and picked up the book she had been reading. It was a fascinating book, called "Ballet Slippers," telling about the struggles of a little girl Janet's age who wished to become a dancer. Janet was absorbed in the tale, and was not conscious that her parents were in the living room until she heard her father say, "Maybe she won't want to go." Her mother's voice answered earnestly, "But she must go, Robert! That's just the point of it she's altogether too wound up in us. She's got to learn that there are other people, other places, other things to do. It troubles me?" Janet's attention sharpened. She listened fearfully. The phrase "she must go" repeated itself over and over in her aroused mind. There was only one "she" in the house who could go. "Maybe you're right," her father said slowly. "But it's going to be hard for her and for Stevie and for us, too!" age 382 "IT know," her mother's voice was patient but determined. "But we've got to learn to get along without her as much as she has to learn to be away from us. Stevie, too. Janet's eleven, Robert. It won't be so many years before there'll be high school dances and excursions, girl chums, and boy friends. I'd never forgive myself if I selfishly or blindly permitted her to give all her time and affection to Stevie and Carol and us!" ' There was her father's indulgent laugh. "You're right as _ usual, sweetheart!" he said. "How much will it cost?" "Not much, Robert. I can pay for it with the money I've saved to buy me that extra summer dress. I don't really need it, you know." 'No, you can't do that, darling! We'll take it out of the education fund. After all, it is part of Janet's education, isn't it?" "But that's definitely for college! If we start dipping into it, it won't be there after while. When we need it. No, I'll. Use the dress money, please. I want to!" "But let me share it, sweetheart! After all, I've saved a little, too?" "For golf clubs, Robert!" There was silence, and Janet could almost see her father smiling and nodding. Then her mother said swiftly, "Of course, dear. Of course, you'd want to! It's settled then? I ll tell Janet today, and you back A COMPLIMENT FOR MOM me up. It may be difficult to persuade her but she must learn that she can leave our love and come back to it that it is a permanent thing, whether she is here or not." Janet laid her head on her arms and closed her eyes against the tears that pressed for release. So they were going to send her away, somewhere! They were going to send her away from Stevie, and baby Carol, and them! And it wasn't because she had been bad? it wasn't because they thought she wanted to go away it was simply because she had been very good and because they knew she wanted to be with them all the time. It was strange the way things worked out. When Mr. And Mrs. Allen had adopted Janet and Stevie two years ago, the little girl's greatest anxiety had been that she or Stevie might somehow do something that would make their foster parents regret taking them. For Janet knew that they had really wanted only Stevie, and had taken her only when they found that the two could not be adopted separately, and that Janet's anxiety to get her brother a home had been making the little girl very unhappy. But as the months had passed and Janet had become conscious that she and her brother had won secure places in their foster parents' hearts, she had grown to feel so secure that she had forgotten that they might ever be separated. Then baby Carol had come, and Janet had become completely enslaved to the adorable little tyrant. And now she would have to leave! For how long? Where would they send her? For awhile misery and questions blended into a suffocating torture. 383 Then Janet, going over and over the conversation she had heard, remembered something. Mommy was going to take the money she had saved for her new dress to pay for this thing. Daddy was going to put in money he had saved for golf clubs. It must mean a lot to them, then. Mommy had said, "She must learn our love will be here that she can go away and come back to it." This was a gift of love, then. What if she didn't want it? She couldn't let them know. She remembered how Stevie had offered his sixty-seven cents to help Uncle Jim get married. Uncle Jim hadn't wanted to take Stevie's money, but he had taken it. He had made Stevie think it was important to him. That's what folks did when they loved someone. So she would have to go away, smiling and laughing and pretending to be happy, even though she was miserable and lonely and did not want to leave them at all not even for one night. And this must be for quite a long time, if it took Mommy's and Daddy's extra money. WHEN Carol woke up and Janet took her from the pram into the house, she gave no sign that she had overheard the conversation that morning. Stevie came in, rumpled and dirty, from a romp with Spot and the new little boy down the street. Stevie had lots of friends? he never worried about leaving home. In the past two years his position had become, in his mind, absolutely unchangeable. At lunch, Mommy said brightly, "IT was reading in the paper about the Girl Scout camp, Janet. You hadn't told me about it, but it sounds lovely, doesn't it?" 384 So that was it! Janet thought. She said, "I forgot." "Miss Gleason was asking me if you didn't want to go. She says you're such a very good scout that she'd particularly like to have you." Janet wanted to say eagerly, "Oh, I'd love to go! I've been wishing I could!" but she couldn't quite make it. She said, instead, "That's what she said to me, too. But I told her I was going to take care of Carol this summer." "Yes," her mother agreed, "there is that to think of. But I believe I could get along for two weeks, if you'd care to go, Janet." Stevie said, his mouth full, "Soon as I can I'm going to be a Cub. Can I go to camp then, Mommy? Can I?" His mother smiled. "I hope so, Son," she said. "And if Janet goes she can learn a great many things you know, how to build a fire, and leather work, and about birds, and how to cook over a campfire. Somebody ought to know these things to help Daddy when we go camping." Janet managed a smile. "I ll go," she said. She couldn't bear the conversation. "Darling!" her mother said, looking at her strangely, "not if you don't want to! Not if you have to say, 'I'll go,' in that voice!" Janet gulped. Then she took hold of herself and grinned. "I want to go, really I do! I sort of wished I could!" It was all the enthusiasm she could muster. During the next few days Janet became rather adept at pretending enthusiasm for the trip. In fact, once in awhile she found herself actually thinking about it without too much unhappiness, even with a fluttering interest. It would be fun to buy the things she needed the heavy oxfords and socks, the knapsack, the toothbrush and soap holder ? to mark her things, to leam to make her bedroll, if only these things had not meant leaving home! She had been to camp once before, with all the children at the Home, and she had thoroughly enjoyed it. But that was different. Stevie had been with her, then. There had been no baby sister to leave to all the unknown fortunes of two long weeks. Stevie didn't seem to realize what was impending. He was rather envious of all Janet's new things, of her being the center of interest, but he didn't actually realize that they would be separated until the very morning of her departure. Daddy and Mommy, with Stevie and the baby, drove Janet to the scout headquarters where the bus would pick her up. Janet hadn't been able to still the fluttering of excitement that made her cheeks pink under the freckles, though her feeling of loss was like a stone in her chest. The little girls and their parents were standing among bedrolls and suitcases on the lawn. Some were chattering and giggling, but others were standing, white-lipped, clinging to their mothers. Stevie stared at the group as his parents got out of the car. Then it burst upon him what this parting meant, and he grabbed Janet. "Don't go, Janet!" he begged. "Don't go and leave me! Take me!" His father looked at him and grinned. "Hey, Big Boy!" he said. A COMPLIMENT FOR MOM little girl in the seat beside ont want to Miss Gleason led the little girl away down the bus to sit beside her, Not her very Own mother? That made it even harder! Ly, homesick, little girl, herself keep up the role, she entered into all the Sports and activities: she elped Miss Gleason with the younger girls: she was a model of the good scout Was Teally fun and she was learning a great deal, By the second day the Omesickness was gtowing faint: by the third, she had actually become shut tight so that her Pillow would not be wet in the moming, have minded all this hidden agony if only the other girls 386 them up before the children as less than the wonderful people they were ?as painting a picture of her home that was ugly and false. Silently, she began to count the days till she could go home again and forget the whole ordeal. But when the last day came, Janet was sorry to leave the woods and the birds, the camp leaders, the fireside story hours, the hikes and outdoor games. Miss Gleason smiled down at Janet as she packed her things. "You look wonderful, Janet," she said. "It's been a nice two weeks, hasn't it?" Janet nodded vigorously. It really had. Then the parents began to arrive in their cars to pick up their daughters. Betty rushed to her mother, flung her arms about her and burst into tears. "Mama!" she cried, "why didn't you come before? I wrote to you I've cried and cried?" Miss Gleason said, very quietly, to Betty's mother, "Betty is not very well adjusted, emotionally, Mrs. Gray. I'd like to talk to you about it some day, very soon." Janet, standing near by, waiting for her own parents, thought, Miss Gleason looks mad at Mrs. Gray. I wonder why. Then the Allen car came into the yard, and Stevie was running toward her, yelling. Janet flung her arms about her brother. Gosh, she told herself, you mustn't cry now. It'll spoil everything. She kissed her mother and father and the baby. "She said, eagerly, "I'm all packed and ready!" pointed to her bedroll. Daddy went to get it. "How has she been, Miss Gleason?" Mommy asked. Janet hoped Miss Gleason wouldn't look mad at Mommy as she had at Mrs. Gray. But she needn't have worried. Miss Gleason's eyes were warm and her smile was friendly. "Janet's been wonderful!" she said earnestly. "She's a beautifully adjusted child. You can easily tell which children come from happy homes?which ones know they are loved?feel secure and happy. I want to congratulate you, Mrs. Allen, on your little girl!" Janet felt a warm glow of gratefulness as she looked up to see how Mommy took the compliment. There were tears in Mommy's eyes. "Thank you," she said softly, and her arm about Janet's shoulders held her a little more tightly. In the car, with baby Carol on her lap, and Stevie snuggled against her, Janet let a couple of fat tears squeeze through her eyelids, as she whispered, "Coming home is the best part of it!" Then she added, honestly, "But I had a wonderful time. May I go next year, too?" "Check Your Driving, Check Your Car,'Check Accidents!" The Police Traffic Safety Check and
