THE ORIGIN OF SONG Katherine Fernelius Larsen Man listened, rapt, when storm winds thundered high And made the forest one vast symphony; He caught new cadences, when on his ears First fell the heavy pulsing of the sea. All these and slow year A depth and breadth, A resignation to embattled A hope of peace for h Out of his joy, his toil, s added to his cry of pain and sorrow born; ed life, earts by anguish torn. His need for God, His grief and pain, through man's allotted days, Music, the comforter of man, was born? Music, the perfect medium of praise!
