THE PRICE duty. They walked south and around the corner until they met on the south side of the fort, then turned and walked back, meeting again on the north side of the cattle corral. Thus the time was to be spent until they were relieved. The grain had prematurely ripened of the excessive heat and drought and the harvesting of it was late since it had taken so much time and work to complete the fort. For that reason, the men who ha worked through the long, burning day cradling and binding grain, were red and worn out. Yom ALTON and Andrew Rasmussen were who emerged for duty that night. Each had cradled five acres of grain that day. As Tom approached corral gate, the animals were being not there. "Where are m' cattle, Bill?" he the herders. "When we drove the herd out of the cottonwoods, your oxen were not there, an' your boy, Tommie, went long." As the darkness fell and still no sign of the boy appeared, Tom walked his beat with an increasing anxiety. Returning from the cattle corral on one of his rounds, he saw 4 shaft of light 409 gleaming through the partly opened fort gate. A woman, middle-aged, handsome, and slender, stood in the illuminated space. Her mass of jet black hair was combed back, braided, and wound into a large bob at the base of her head. Her features were finely and delicately formed. The large, expressive black eyes bespake both spirit and tenderness. Peculiarly curved little wrinkles at the comers of her mouth showed that her face was pleasant, and that "she Her chin and mouth have one the impression of strength Everyone in the fort knew that it was not an easy Hannah Alton's mind when she had made it up. In and obstinate. T that she was the kindest and gentlest woman in the world, and the best and most cheerful of wives. He knew what had brought her there. He hoped to hide his anxiety concerning the boy from her, but felt sure he could not do it. He therefore hesitated a moment in Ot der to organize a plan. "Halt! Who goes there?" "Tt is I, thy wife, Hannah," replied. "And I am sorely smitten wi anxiety because OUT Tommie is out lookin' for the cattle and hasna' returned." "Thou mustna worry," comforted Tom. "I havena' doubt that our Tommie will be able to ta' care 0 on 9? Himself and come in after a bit. "Tom, thou wanna tell me that thou are not worried over the lad Thou must leave off standing guard and go and seek him." "That I canna' do without the 410 permission of the captain," replied Tom soberly. "The captain willna' give you leave," said Hannah. "J have already sought him and he says that all the men are tired and that thou must ta' thy regular turn at guard. The captain don'na' like me." She looked toward the blackness, closing them in, the dark that held her boy. "Tom, thou must go. I will ta' thy place and attend guard instead o' thee." "Hannah," answered Tom, "I fain would go and seek the lad, but thou knowest I canna' substitute anyone in my place. I'm disobeying orders even to let thee stand and delay me. Go to the captain and send 'im hither that I may seek my release." "Nay, Tom," she replied. "If thou willna' or canna' go and seek thy son who is out yonder, I shall take thy place there. There's na' rule or order as can stop me from that." She turned and ran into the darkness. Tom ran after her and called, but she was gone. At the corner ot the fort he met Andrew Rasmussen, who was waiting there for him. "Vat und who was dat?" he said excitedly. "Und vy don't you stop im?" "That was my wife," said Tom. "And naught but a bullet could stop 'er. Our Tommie is out there huntin' cattle, and she ha' gone to seek im Tom walked rapidly back to the gate and called loudly to the captain. When he came, he seemed not at all pleased. "What do you want now?" he asked rather irritably. "Mi lad is out yonder at the cottonwoods hunting mi cattle," said Tom meekly, "an' mi wife is greatly worried and excited about it. I wish to be excused from guard duty while I go an' seek 'im." "The boy is all night. He's able to take care of himself! He's nearly aman. Thirteen, isn't he?" "Yes, the lad is past thirteen," replied Tom. "But mi wife ha' gone in search o' him. She willna' retum until she finds the lad and he willna' come back without the cattle. 1 canna' stay here safe while mi own are out there in the dark. For God's sake release me, captain. I must go to 'em." "You have worked yourself into a stew about nothing. It has been weeks since we saw an Indian. The darkness won't hurt them." The captain started to go, then, as one suddenly remembering something, he turned back. "Tom! You have disobeyed orders by permitting your wife to pass. You should never have let her do so. Your wife is too headstrong. Since she has gone, let her stay. 'The experience will not do her any-harm. Continue your guard duty." TOM resumed the patrol of the beat. His heart was heavy and he was greatly worried. He did not speak to the other guard as they met. As he walked, he stared into the darkness. Once he fancied he saw them coming, heard the footfalls of the oxen, but he knew the things he saw and heard were only creatures of his imagination. The temptation to desert his post and go in search of his dear ones was almost irresistible, but he remained. He walked, and listened and stared, he pictured horrible things, until finally he was quite mad. His consciousness seemed to be aware of but one thing. He must THE PRICE walk, walk, walk, back and forth, back and forth. He must walk until he could see the outline of Andrew Rasmussen's broad shoulders and then turn, walk back, meet Rasmussen, tur back. He was almost crushed with the pettiness of it in the face of the greater danger. How slowly the time dragged on. Would this eternal walking never cease? Where were his wife and son? Walk! Walk! Walk! Around the corner. He could see the outline of Rasmussen a rod or so out from the cattle fence. Rasmussen turned and started back. Tom, too, began to retrace his steps. He passed the corner, and made his steady march by the wall of the fort. A hoot owl near the cattle corral called. Another out towards the mountain answered. Suddenly, Tom recalled that he had passed a shadowy something lying against the fence. Becoming instantly alert, he whirled about and walked cautiously back. Yes, there it was! A dark shadow lying against the fence. It might be an animal that had been left out of the corral. Perhaps it was one of his own oxen that had returned. Perhaps Tommie had driven them in after all. He began to walk rapidly toward the dark spot. There was a movement. The shadow began to divide, to take several forms, to become human beings. Was it? Could it be Indians? Yes, he was sure of it now. The forms made a dash for the darkness. Tom's musket came to his shoulder. He fired! Following the report there was a moan, a thudding sound as if something heavy had fallen upon the soft earth. Then for an instant all was quiet. Soon, however, there came to Tom's ears low moans from 411 out in the darkness, which were soon drowned by the commotion from the fort. The report of the shot had aroused the people inside. Having fired, Tom mechanically but rapidly began to reload his musket. He had hardly finished when several men appeared near the corral gate. "Halt!" called Tom. "Who are you?" "What's happened?" asked one of the group. "T think I ha' shot an Indian." Investigation proved that he had, indeed, wounded an Indian, and that several Indians had begun to dig out a section of the corral fence with a view to stampeding the cattle. It was near midnight and Tom sought the captain and obtained his release from further guard duty. The commander did not think it wise to search for Hannah and Tommie until it came daybreak, but Tom did. He entered the low room occupied by himself and family and bade his sleeping children a silent farewell. (The shepherd must seek the lost one, even though the risk to the flock be great.) Stumbling along through the greasewoods, anxious to reach the cottonwoods and their protection, Tom prayed. Now that he could do something, make an effort to aid his wife and son, his calmness and good sense returned. The Indians might be close still. He stopped and listened, and then crept cautiously on. After ages of time had elapsed, as it seemed to him, he finally dared to call into the darkness. But no answer came to him save the noises of the night. As the first streaks of gray appeared in the east, Tom, weary and heartsick, pushed up 412 through the cottonwood thicket. Suddenly, on the still morning air, in came to him. "Tommie, is it thou?" "No, Hannah," he replied. "It isna' the lad, but 'tis I, thy husband, How art thou?" He moved closer to the place where her voice had seemed to come from. "Hast thee seen aught of the Jad?" "I am safe," assuringly, "But I havena' seen Tommie. "God h night. I'm fearful for the safety of our Tommie lad," It was glowing lighter, They wandered on to the edge of the cottonskirted along the southern edge of the cottonwoods, going east toward Tom's attention was or more cattle accompanied by unshod ponies. The trail led from the southwest toward the canyon and, without stopping to reason why, they both instinctively turned and followed the trail. A full mile they something Hannah looked, her face blanched, but she said, "Come. Let us see," Running, stumbling, falling, through brush ? down gullies, up steep banks, they hurried until they arrived beneath the circling buzzards, "There he is!" cried Hannah, His strong young aIrows, and the life gone from his body. A stone clasped in his brave tight hand and numerous moccasin prints in the soft earth told only too well what had happened. Crushed and dumb with gtief and sorrow, the parents knelt by the side of the dead boy in silence. "Hannah," bitterly ~ exclaimed Tom. "I canna' bear it!

It had as well be thee and me as some other man and wife. And when 'tis done, 'twill be a good home for thee and me, and a fine inheritance for our children," "Oh, Hannah!" And there were tears in his eyes as he reverently placed his arm about her, "Thou art an angel! Thy courage and fortitude hath shamed away my weakness," Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 3 Synopsis: Enid and Tom Drage, a young married couple, are very happy in their humble furnished apartment in a small town until Tom is brought home dead from a factory accident. Enid is frightened by the future she must make for her small daughter, but she feels Tom's influence still with her. NID lay in the tall grass in the back yard. The leaves of the lilac bush above her moved ever so slightly in the hot July breeze. Sharon was playing near by, putting sand into a little bucket, then emptying it again on the sand pile. The child's face was tranquil, full of peace and instinctive contentment. Enid thought of the words, "Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven." She wondered vaguely if that was what it meant that we must accept life simply, accept each day as a good gift, without doubt or sorrow or apprehension. But acceptance was hard when one could see such a little way ahead in the great scheme of things. Already her problems were beginning to loom large and frightening. The grocer who had been so kind when Tom was alive was becoming cool, more hesitant about filling her orders. Her rent would soon be due and the money for it was not there. She knew the moment was near when she must go and talk to Miss Nobbitt. That was difficult, for, though the woman had been kind enough in her way, Enid felt somewhat afraid of her, of her set mouth and her sternness. But money was not her only problem. She was lonely. The hopes she had had of a happy social life were gone. Everyone was very kind when she went to her meetings, but it ended there. The other women went home to busy households, to husbands coming home, to parties, perhaps, where there would be so many couples. There was no place for an extra woman, especially one with a small child. She closed her eyes for a moment, then forced herself to smile a little wryly. She wasn't going to feel sorry for herself. Not any more. It was a beautiful day; the sun was warm upon her face, upon her bare arms. It seemed to hold healing in its warmth, and peace, and a calm reassurance. She looked up at the wide blue sky, endless, incomprehensible. Her world seemed to grow small, her troubles seemed to become insignificant before its vastness. What was one life, one problem, in the face of the great, wonderful universe. Every bird singing above her head was cared for, every wind was guided in its direction; surely the God who kept all things in order, who made all things, would be mindful of her, also. Her muscles relaxed and stretched. Her child laughed in complete happiness. Enid sat up, feeling suddenly that this moment when she had Page 413 414 found new courage, new hope, temporary though it might be, was the time to go and talk to Miss Nobbitt. She stood up, ran her hand over her skirt, straightening it. Then she reached a hand to Sharon, saying, "Come here, darling. We must go into the house." The child shook her head, looking crestfallen. "We will come back," her mother assured her, wiping the sand from her small chubby fingers and putting an unruly curl in place. Miss Nobbitt liked the child. It was wise, as well as necessary, to take her with her when she made the call. As she waited on the porch for her landlady to answer the door, she could see through the screen the part of the house which the woman occupied. It was beautifully, almost lavishly, furnished with substantial, rather old furniture. It looked cool and comfortable after the warm sun. Evidently her family had been well off, enough so, at least, that she had a home for the rest of her life and an apartment to rent. A home of one's own, a place where no one could say, "Now you must move," seemed a wonderful possession to Enid. Something sure, something good, more than a_ shelter, more than most people seemed to realize. She would have felt so much better if Tom and she had owned a home, if it had been their own, if they had put hours into it, painting, planting, furnishing. It would have been an extra bond between them. It would have been an extra safeguard for their child, for she had noticed that the children whose parents owned their homes, who were settled and part of a street or a community, were less likely to go astray, to look far afield for pleasure and happiness. Miss Nobbitt was coming toward her, dressed in her perpetual afternoon black. "Oh," she greeted Enid, almost in surprise, "come in." Enid smiled up at her in friendliness and a little shyness, "I hope I'm not disturbing you." "Of course not. Come into the sitting room. It is cooler there." They passed into the large parlor, across a hall with heavy oak paneling into another comfortable room with chintz-covered chairs, with hand-carved tables, with a shiny, new Victrola in one comer. Enid couldn't resist saying, "How nice. How very nice." ACAIN there was a look of surprise in Miss Nobbitt's eyes as she looked about the room. "It's comfortable," was all she said, sitting down rather stiffly, motioning her guest to do likewise. Enid lifted Sharon to her knee as she gave herself a moment more of time before she approached the subject about which she must speak. Miss Nobbitt waited in silence. Ominous silence, Enid felt, as she cried within herself, "Oh, why don't you say something, make it a little easier. Aren't you human?" Yet, her voice was controlled and soft as she finally spoke. She said, "IT thought I would speak to you about the rent. I know you could rent your rooms to someone who would be more' dependable than we are. I haven't much money left, but I am going to try to find something to do... I'll make it all up _. If you'll let us stay..." She hadn't meant to have her FAITH IS A HERITAGE voice break, to have tears come to her eyes. But it was too late now, it didn't matter. She wiped her eyes, murmuring, "I'm sorry," as she started to rise, afraid to wait for an answer, wondering what had made her believe this austere woman could be touched, could be human. But Miss Nobbitt was telling her to sit down and she was obeying. She looked at her questioningly and was amazed to see tears in the older woman's eyes. "Listen to me, my child," she was saying, "I know you think me unkind and heartless. I'm not. When you first came here with your handsome husband, I used to watch you laughing together. I would see him kiss your hair and I felt I couldn't bear it. I thought I disliked you. When your child was born my dislike seemed to grow. I know now it was jealousy. You had the things I have been denied. Even when your husband died I was still jealous because you had this beautiful little girl. Somehow, today, as you talked I felt almost as if you were my own daughter... You could be, you know. I'm so ashamed." She pressed her hand hard against her eyes and her body shook with harsh sobs. She wept as one who has long forgotten the relief of tears. Enid came over to her, admonishing, "You mustn't cry, it's all right." For the first time, Enid saw Miss Nobbitt smile, a tremulous, gentle smile as she dried her eyes and reached out her arms to Sharon who was standing beside her, looking incredulously sad. "Come here," she whispered, "come here and let me hold you." The next moment she was pressing 415 the child to her in great love and gentleness. "You see," she was saying, "I know what it means to be in love. I loved someone once... Very, very much. My family objected and I sent him away. Of course, I kept hoping he would come back. But I learned later that he married a girl in California. Some said it was done for spite, I don't know. Right now... And for the first time... I hope not. There's so little happiness, I hope he found it with her. I hope she was happy, too." She added simply, "He's dead now." Enid looked at her with great compassion. She tried to imagine her as she must have looked twenty-five years ago, tall and slender and pretty... In love and happy. It seemed to her now that everyone had a cross to bear sooner or later. It helped a little to think that. Miss Nobbit told her, " I want you to stay on here as long as you want. Make it your home, forget about the rent." "I couldn't do that," protested the girl, her blue eyes wide, "I'll pay you when I get to working." "What do you intend to do?" "IT suppose I'll have to just do anything. I was studying to be a teacher. I wish I had finished... Though I wouldn't have missed these beautiful years... With Tom." "Perhaps, if you work, you can save enough to go back to school. You'll have quite awhile to support Sharon if you don't marry again." Enid looked at her as if the thought were incongruous, "Oh, I'll never do that," she assured her. "You're young. You're very pretty. Don't let bitterness spoil your 416 life, as I did. But, to get back to the work, there are several women in town who need help in their homes. I'm sure you could keep quite busy." Enid recoiled from the thought of going into other women's homes as a servant, doing menial work. Miss Nobbitt seemed to know her thoughts for she told her, "Don't be too proud. Any work that is honest is honorable. As long as you have the strength to work... And a clear conscience, you have practically everything." "Thank you," Enid said. "You've been more than kind. You don't know how it helps." "Yes, I do. I should have done all of this much, much sooner. I was too selfish. Now, the two of you' come over here a little later for supper. I have a new phonograph and some records. We'll have a pleasant time." They did have a pleasant time. Enid was more happy and more ready for sleep than she had been for many days. Just as she had tucked the child in for the night and dimmed the light, there was a knock on the door. She opened it, looking out into the lavender evening, gathering upon the world. She saw a tall man in a dark suit standing in the doorway. For a moment, she was sure he had the wrong door. But he reassured her, asking her name and adding, "I'd like to talk to you about your husband's death." (To be continued ) CLASS REUNION Olive M.

Erickson Page 417 418 Big Horn Stake (Wyoming) Lovell Ward ROM Big Horn Stake, under the presidency of Grace E. Allphin, the report of an outstanding evening of music has been received. The Singing Mothers of Lovell Ward presented a number of very beautiful renditions, including "'Holiness Becometh the House of the Lord," "Holy Redeemer," "Lift Thine Eyes to the Mountain," and "Let All My Life Be Music." The director was Carma B. Johnson, with Ada B. Baxter and Veoma Stahle as accompanists. The organ prelude was played by Sister Daisy A. Tew. So excellent was the rendition, and so satisfying the spiritual influence of this program, that Bishop Frank H. Brown of the Lovell Ward wrote the General Board of Relief Society the following comment on the performance: I am herewith enclosing a printed program for an evening of music presented by the Singing Mothers of the Lovell Ward Relief Society. It was one of the finest and most inspiring evenings I have spent for many years. The spirit of the occasion was outstanding, and the ability of the sisters in their presentation of the songs was of the highest type. The public was invited to enjoy this hour of music with the saints, and their pleasure and admiration were very great. You sisters of the Relief Society are to be congratulated on having in your organization a group known as the Singing Mothers. Many people have been brought closer to their Maker because of the very sweet services rendered by these sisters.

NOTES FROM THE FIELD 419 MOUNT GRAHAM STAKE, DUNCAN WARD (ARIZONA), HANDWORK DISPLAY From Mount Graham Stake, under the presidency of Erma M. Stewart, two photographs of an unusually beautiful handwork display have been received from Beatrice Merrell, Second Counselor in the Duncan Ward Relief Society. This display, in addition to the handwork, featured many treasured relics of pioneer days. 420 Pasadena Stake (California) EI Sereno Ward ROM Pasadena Stake, under the presidency of Madge P. Fowler, an unusually effective program is reported by Louise Willard, President of El Sereno Ward Relief Society: "A 'Temple of Life' was constructed, and a program portrayed a radio broadcast by the Relief Society women. This was the introductory program of the year and presented a real challenge to our members. E] Sereno is anticipating the building of a new chapel and the theme of the broadcast was designed for this purpose. Invitations in the form of a miniature chapel were mailed to each woman in the ward. 2 I N c kd "When the sisters assembled to hear the broadcast, introductions were made by our first counselor, and Sister Marzelle Mangum sang "IT Love a Little Cottage." Then the announcer, Faun Demke, asked what each sister had to contribute toward the building of the chapel. Our president, Louise Willard, made a comparison of the erecting of temporal buildings to the building of character. She placed, as the foundation of the chapel, Faith, Truth, Humility, Love. "The social science teacher, Blanche Calvert, placed the stately pillars, Tolerance, Sincerity, Trustworthiness, Morality.

God-given Beauty was last added to this temple by Second Counselor Mary Snyder, when she placed Cheerfulness, Friendliness, Health, Understanding. "Marzelle Mangum sang "Bless This House," and Edna Kidwell gave the benediction. After the program each sister was given a pencil and paper and asked to either draw a plan or to write down the ideas she might have toward the construction and decoration of a perfect Relief Society room." Emigration Stake (Salt Lake City, Utah) Thirteenth Ward ILLIE C. ADAMS, President of Emigration Stake Relief Society, submits an account of the accomplishments of the Society in the Thirteenth Ward as reported by First Counselor Thelma Vetterli: "We have just completed an outstanding year of work filled with spiritual development and growth. Our greatest accomplishment was to acquaint the younger sisters of the ward with Relief Society work and interest them to the extent that they are now actively engaged with us as a vital part of the organization. 422 We engaged the services of a competent person to conduct a nurse and play hour for the young children during meeting. "We then gave these younger sisters a job to do and we made them feel needed. On work meeting day, this year, we inaugurated a monthly program luncheon to follow the usual work. The younger sisters have had complete charge of the luncheon and a master of ceremonies from this group arranged the programs and conducted them. To mark the difference from the old work and business day, we call it work and fun day. "We have used the general theme of "Friendship" and we note the birthdays of the sisters each month, making a little ceremony of presenting each Birthday Lady with a corsage. 'This simple act has brought untold joy to many. The speakers for the day are selected with the purpose of offering a wide variety of subjects, including some excellent demonstrations. During the season we presented a well-known local authority on ceramic art who brought with her a beautiful collection of antique and modern figurines. On another occasion, a demonstration of flower arrangements was given with suggestions on interior _and exterior decoration for the holidays. Another time a woman told of her life as a missionary in Tahiti. On this occasion, our members brought their personal treasures of all kinds, handwork and odd and interesting items. When we celebrated the 103d anniversary of the founding of the Relief Society, many ladies wore pioneer costumes and the feature of that day was a relic show. Many of these items had been carried across the plains by the pioneers. Included were furniture, pictures, china, books, and old letters bearing famous signatures. "Our class attendance on work and business day previously averaged twenty-two. It is now fifty-one." Maricopa Stake (Arizona) ROM Maricopa Stake, under the presidency of Vida D. Brinton, a report of an anniversary program presented in connection with the welfare assignment has been received through the stake secretary, Irene A. Duke: "At ten o'clock a. M. March 13, 1945, the Relief Society sisters arrived to decorate and arrange the ward displays around the sides of the spacious Mezona Hall. The center of attraction at the front of the hall was a beautiful Relief Society birthday cake and lighted tapers at each and of a lovely lace covered table. A profusion of spring flowers decorated the Hall and the tables in the banquet room where each ward served a delicious luncheon for all of its members at noon. During the luncheon hour, former Relief Society stake presidents were honored and presented with corsages. All other former and present groups of stake and ward officers were honored and asked to stand. Mothers with three and four daughters present were also paid tribute. "After luncheon, a unique program was presented in the form of a skit written by our stake Relief Society president, Sister Vida Driggs Brinton. Modern and old-fashioned costumes were displayed. NOTES FROM THE FIELD Two little girls from Tempe Ward, Anita and Carolyn Cox, dressed in modern and pioneer dresses, respectively, stood as announcers at the microphone while a delightful program of modern and old-fashioned music, songs, dances, and readings was presented by the different wards. Many of the Relief Society women were attired in pioneer costumes which created an atmosphere of yesteryears, bringing back loving memories and the spirit of our pioneer ancestors." 423 Maricopa Stake (Arizona) Tempe Ward Irene A. Duke, Maricopa Stake Secretary, reports the following item from Tempe Ward: "Early in the summer, President Lola O. Turley called her counselors together to make plans for a fall bazaar. Realizing the scarcity of cotton material and all types of children's clothes, Sister Turley suggested making all the items for the bazaar from salvage material.

From clothing generally considered worthless the sisters made most of the articles for the bazaar." Texas-Louisiana Mission Corpus Christi Branch ROM the Texas-Louisiana Mission, where Sister Christie J Smith is president of the Relief Society, a detailed report of activities in the Corpus Christi Branch has been received through the president, Phyllis W. Harmon: "The Corpus Christi Relief Society is composed largely of young navy wives, many of whom are attending Relief Society for the first time. Their enthusiasm and co-operation have made a most successful season. This Relief Society is fully organized, the outline lessons are studied, and the special Sunday programs presented. In addition, the group has undertaken, as a special project, the serving of a monthly dinner for the servicemen. These dinners have been very successful and the proceeds have been donated to the branch building fund. "Our popular activity is sewing. Most of the sewing has been done for the March 17th bazaar.

Children from four to fifteen years old gave a program of singing, instrumental _ selections, readings, and tap dancing. "The month of August brought forth a display of hobbies, fancywork, relics, antiques, and large numbers of souvenirs sent home by servicemen.

Northwestern States Mission Astoria Branch (Oregon) the Northwestern States Mission, under the presidency of Lenora K. Bringhurst, the report of an anniversary program is given by Sister Lois Allred, Secretary-Treasurer of the Astoria Branch: "The 103d anniversary social was held under the direction of President Meta Stevens with Lois Allred acting as chairman.

East Mill Creek Stake (Utah) Evergreen Ward ROM East Mill Creek Stake, where Sarah E. Bateman is the 427 new Relief Society president, an interesting note on the recently organized Evergreen Ward has been received through the ward president, Gladys M. Rudd: "Our new stake is small in numbers but strong in faith, with powerful men to guide it. With only 130 families in our ward, our attendance is small, but we feel that the spirit of the Heavenly Father is with us. He has said that where only a few have met in my name there I will be also. "We plan to build a new stake house and chapel with our beautiful mountains as the background, a building where we can come to worship and enjoy ourselves. We hope that when it is completed we will NORTHERN STATES MISSION, PERU (INDIANA) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY Photograph taken on Mother's Day, May 13, 1945  EAST MILL CREEK STAKE (UTAH) EVERGREEN WARD RELIEF SOCIETY Front row, left to right: Second Counselor Grace Keller; President Gladys M.

Stoddard, former president, Northern States Mission Relief Society, submitted a report of activities in the Cleveland Branch, written by the president, Emma Glauser: "During the months beginning with October and including May, we have our regular Relief Society meetings. Our class leaders are faithful and capable Latter-day Saint women, Our visiting teachers make their regular visits and we try to accomplish this activity 100 per cent, but, due to the long distances the teachers must travel, this is not always possible. The Relief Society women have made many visits to the sick. They have stayed in the homes and in the hospitals when it has been necessary to do so. "A special activity for the past year and a half has been to give each expectant mother in the branch a baby shower. We usually have a large attendance and enjoy ourselves together. 'These occasions have made our members feel more united and have given them a greater understanding of each other's needs and a better acquaintance with the group." Western States Mission LUCILE B.

This year we have organized three new Societies: Fort Summer, New Mexico: Bridgeport, Nebraska; and Rapid City, South Dakota. The Clovis, New Mexico, Relief Society has been reorganized and is functioning again. We have four very fine district supervisors. Annie Ellsworth of Lubbock, Texas, supervises our East New Mexico District; Emma Allen, of Omaha, Nebraska, is in charge of our Winter Quarters District; Lucille Freeman of Grants, New Mexico, supervises the West New Mexico District; Marie Hymas has charge of the Scottsbluff and Black Hills District. All four travel regularly and report to me each week. Their splendid supervision is doing much to help the women in our outlying districts. "Wherever in the districts I have inspected the welfare assignments, I have been delighted with the First Counselor; Violet Platt, Second Counselor; Mary w; Helen Skousen; Alta Gallagher; Margaret n; Eva Pulley; Renee Wright; Cecil Bean;; Gertrude Wilstead; Virginia Howard. Workmanship, the quality, and the quantity. We have a large supply of new clothing and bedding on hand, as well as a huge chest containing cleaned and repaired used clothing. Bazaars and food sales have been held in many of our branches, in an effort to help raise building funds. In Sheridan, Wyoming, $500 was raised this year by a small group for this purpose. "Our October reports were really amazing the best attendance record in the history of the mission. Also, I am very happy to report that nearly 100 per cent of our organizations are holding a monthly preparation meeting. I feel that the fine condition of the organizations is largely due to their holding these planning meetings for unified, purposeful work. "My work has been truly inspiring to me. It is with reluctance I leave the Relief Society women of this mission." Work Meeting Mash-Sack Magic REGISTER Mary A. Hansen, President of the Uvada (Nevada) Stake Relief Society, reports an unusual sewing project which has helped to solve some of the urgent problems confronting homemakers at this time. "During these years," says Sister Hansen, "when the purchase of materials for household uses has been so difficult, many women have tuneed to substitutes. One of the questions frequently asked is, "These mash sacks, what about them? I understand that sheets can be made from them. What do you do to get them white?' "Because of this interest, our stake Relief Society board used the sack project last year. We bought two hundred and seventy-five sacks from the turkey growers for ten cents apiece. Each board member took some of the sacks to bleach and turn into something useful and lovely for our bazaar. "A wonderfully easy way to bleach these paint-marked sacks into snowy white cloth is as follows: Put about eighteen sacks, which have been opened by removing the threads and shaken to remove the mash dust, into a large tub and pour a gallon of kerosene (coal oil) over them. This amount of kerosene will just dampen this many sacks. Let them soak for several hours or over night. Page 430 Then, with hot soapsuds (the more soap used the more quickly the sacks will become white), put them in the washing machine for several minutes, wring out, and wash again with another strong soapsuds. Some sacks may require three or four washings for thorough bleaching. "Ironed well, the mash sacks can be easily made into many useful items for the home many things that we still cannot buy in the stores. These sacks can be made into beautifully decorated dish towels, tablecloths, pillowcases, sheets, boys' shorts, little girls' slips, women's pajamas, and many other necessities. "To make pillowcases, fold the sacks with the selvage at the top for the hems. This makes the cases wider. Put a crocheted edge on them, a bit of embroidery, and when they are starched and ironed they resemble linen. To make dish towels for a very special gift or for your own dishtowel drawer, buy a transfer pattern for use in making embroidery designs, or cut some applique patterns fruits, flowers, or leaves. Even plain, with nice straight hems, you will have dish towels that will be a welcome addition to the household linen closet. These are large towels and are very easy to launder. "To make a pair of pajamas for a WORK MEETING woman, use three and a half sacks: if the pajamas are to have short sleeves. Use braid, rickrack, or some attractive print from the scrap bag for trimming the white material. "Get a pattern and make your little girls some easy-to-launder slips for school. Make some shorts for your boys. Make yourself an apron with brightly colored trimming. "To make mash sacks into lovely little crib quilts, a sack is cut into sixteen even blocks. A little kitten, lamb, dog, or child design can be o 431 stamped on each block. When the blocks are embroidered and set together with colored material and quilted, they will be proudly studied and enjoyed by the small boy or girl. These quilts, fifty-two by sixty inches in size, will provide warm covers for cold nights. "To make something useful and beautiful out of 'practically nothing' is an achievement of which to be proud. Let us help to encourage the home arts, even to the use of a bit of mash-sack magic." Note: The directions for the project ""Let's Make Dickies" which appeared in the April Magazine were submitted by Sister Larene Lindquist of the South Salt Lake Stake; and the suggestions for making the '"'Grosgrain Ribbon Handbag," published in May, were submitted by Sister Blanche Hansen White of the Boise Stake. We wish to thank these sisters for their excellent suggestions. <> LITTLE QUAILS TAKE A WALK Lydia Hall They follow where their mother goes And try to match her stride; Though they are small, they all contain Large quantities of pride. It is adventurous, this trip Which now they undertake, And one with those that history gives To Raleigh and to Drake. There are so many dangers here, And they're so soft and shy; A sharp-clawed hawk is sometimes hid In the wide, velvet sky. But as they march through sun-warmed sand, Past scanty brush and stone, They view the world with wonderment And claim it as their own. Page 432 MOTHERS OF THIS DAY Gene Romolo THE CUP Mothers of this day, the acrid cup That life so often brims and brims anew For woman's lips, is once more lifted up, Brimming with its bitterness for you; And you, whose will would dash the cup to earth, Must dnnk long draughts from it. Do pangs and fears, That you have suffered at man's hour of birth, Appear ill-recompensed in these dire years? Then, Mothers, think of her, who, weeping, stood Beside a cross and watched athwart a hill, Its shadow deep, until a lowered rood Yielded from its nails her Son grown still! Mary drained the cup of Calvary When she beheld her Son's death agony. COMPENSATION When Time shall fold Grief's veil back from each face, And you behold an ideal in a morrow That you have helped to mold, and, by God's grace, You learn that she, the mother of all sorrow, Is not the one whose son, hate crucifies, But she beneath whose heart, in embryo, A Judas lay; then, verily your eyes, Now drenched with tears, will shine with prideful glow, For never falls a hero but is bred A valiant spark that grows into a flare To illuminate the way that lies ahead? You, mothers of this day, who still must share The honor that your loyal children win In conflict to defeat a scourge of sin. TRANSFIGURATION After Calvary, transfiguration As surely comes as day succeeds the night; Blackout now is lifted, and each nation Is flooded with beneficence of light. Young mothers in the crook of their fond arms Will cradle proudly many a wee head, Assured of safety from world-clutching harms, Because another generation bled And died a generation that you bore. Mothers of this day, because of you, the soil Will be resculptured patterned as before Grim-visaged men laid waste the fruits of toil, And the bird of peace again will build its nest, To brood strong fledglings under wings and breast.
