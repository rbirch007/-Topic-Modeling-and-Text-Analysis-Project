SANCTUARY Alice Mortey Bailey The gardener kneels to work with simple faith, Observing laws of petal, root and spathe? So much of earth, and sun, so many seeds; He tolerates no parasites, no weeds. Beneath his hand a rug of sweet grass grows, And chapel walls of ivy, climbing rose. Soft pansies bloom like timid thoughts?in shade, And moonflowers glow at night afraid Of too much day. The cups of tulips lift In lovely hope; bright leaves entreat the gift Of heaven, offering sacrament. These preach The truth and beauty roots and branches teach; All of earth and sea and sky are here And no dissension rifts the breeze no fear. Upon his knees the gardener works the sod And humbly grows his little prayers to God. A ee On Courage Marjorie M. Hamrick i I could teach my children and others one thing, I believe 1 would choose courage, the kind of courage that is an integral part of faith and love an indomitable courage that nothing could shake or move from its place. Life is never one smooth path. The more rugged the slope, the more effort the climber must make, and the more strength it gives to him. The higher one climbs, the broader the view, and the farther one can see into the distance. It is well, too, to remember that the higher the mountain, the more intense and furious the storms, but, after the storm, the rarer and finer and purer the air, and the more beautifully the sun shines. And so it is with life, the deeper the despair and the gloom, the more we appreciate the sunny places the happy days. And so, by struggle and a continual contrast, we progress and grow grace in the sight of God and man. Page 387
