Only Human Marguerite J. Griffin AMILLA stepped upon the C back porch to shake the dust from a small rug. She was hot and tired, with a weariness more than physical. "Jimmy!" she called petulantly, "Look at your clothes!" The six-year-old youngster, wiry and angular, stopped to look first at his mother and then down at the smudges across his middle. "No one would believe you were clean this morning." "Oh, Dick 'n Bill 'n me was just playing Indians. They bound me up so I got dirty." Now Camilla could see the other two grubby faces peering out from behind the lilac bush by the back fence. Their eyes were wide and solemn. Jimmy spoke quickly, "Never mind, Mama. It's Bill's turn to get caught next, and then I won't get so dirty." "Well, don't be too noisy or you'll disturb Grandma," she said, falling back on the old worry. "But Grandma's out walking in the yard." Camilla turned surprised eyes to the place where the small dirty finger pointed. Sure enough, her mother was coming toward them, light of step as in the old days. Her face seemed more relaxed and Camilla felt a burst of gladness warm her heart, and words rushed to her lips. Why, Mother, you look as you always did! You're yourself again! But she didn't say them. She dared not. Page 402 For after all, this was the first time her mother had even ventured out of her room for five months, since the day the telegram had come from the War Department: "Regret to inform you that your son, Lt. Robert Wynston, is reported missing in a flight over Germany." Mother had collapsed on that day. It hadn't mattered that she had other sons Robbie was her baby in spite of being six feet two inches tall. Her mind had seemed to snap, and she hadn't accepted the fact. Since then she had lived in the past. Jimmy spoke first, "Hello, Grandma. It's good to see you outside." The graying woman fondled the child's tousled head and the lines of her white face softened a little. "Isn't he a sight?" asked Camilla nervously. "You'd never know he was clean two hours ago." "Don't scold him, Camilla," the woman 'said wearily. "Be glad you have him to scrub and care for." So Camilla knew there was no change in her mother. Physically she walked in the garden. Mentally she was no better. All she thought and talked about was Robbie when he was a child at her knee, the things he'd said, the things he'd done. That was all she seemed to remember. Scrubbing grimy knees, washing dirty ears, combing a tousled head, always Robbie. She had reared a large family. She had lived her life bravely, but Robbie, the youngest, she had kept in her heart as her baby. ONLY HUMAN When her other boys had gone to war, she had borne it. They were men. They were self-reliant. But Robbie was only a youth for all his strapping size. She had almost wilted when he left for camp. She had visibly aged when he had been sent overseas. And when he had been reported missing, something in the stamina of her character had snapped, and she had lain crushed and hopeless for weeks on end. It was the flesh of him she longed for, just to know where he lay, living or? dead. Yes, Camilla could see that her mother was still the same, and the grim despair of it weighed down on her once more. BUT Mrs. Wynston could see things, too, for she had not lost all her power of understanding. She realized that Camilla was bearing the brunt of her weakness, and she knew she had no night to burden her in such a way. She did not want to do it and yet she couldn't seem to help herself. How could one fight when fight was gone? Someday, perhaps, she would tell Camilla, thank her for her love and patience, but not today. Today it was all she could do to walk in the garden and feel the warmth of the sun upon her stooping shoulders and wonder if it shone on Robbie somewhere ? somewhere. Tl just walk around a little," she said, trying to smile. Camilla watched her mother turn the corner of the house, thinking, Her step is strong and sure. It's her heart that weighs her down, not her body's heart, her soul's. Mrs. Wynston walked faster and 403 faster as she neared the front yard as if, strangely enough, she were anticipating something. Yet she could not have said why she felt the way she did, but urgency was there, and she went straight to the front gate. For a moment she leaned upon it with one hand, shading her eyes with the other, as if she knew she would see a tall, lithe soldier with air corps insignia coming up the street with a familiar swing swinging stride. And yet, when she did see exactly that, she wiped her eyes as if it were a mirage, as if, fearfully, it would vanish. But the figure came on and on, and her heart beat faster. If it were only Robbie! But it was almost as good as seeing Robbie himself. It was his chum, Don Murphy, who lived a block up the street and another one down. The two had been inseparable, as they grew up, had gone into the same service, had even flown in the same plane in countless raids over Germany. If Don were back? He came inside the gate and took the small gray woman in his arms, tenderly, gently, yet with almost the same affection and strength that Robbie would have done. For a moment she could pretend it was Robbie. She could say to herself, "Robbie is here." But all the while she knew it wasn't so. He held her from him at last, and he saw the question in her eyes that her lips were too tremulous to ask. Tears thickened his voice when he spoke. "I flew with him on every mission. I'd have been on that last one, only I was stricken with appendicitis the night before. But don't worry, Mrs. Wynston, Rob can take care of him- 404 self all right. Lots of flyers parachute and get out through the underground. Just lots." "Its been five months, though." "It takes time. More than you can imagine." "I suppose so. Let's sit here on this bench a minute. Can you stay a little while?" Her knees had no strength. " Sure. No one knows I'm coming home anyway. I wanted to drop in on them and find them just as I left them, with no fuss or bother." But you can't do that, she thought with fleeting panic. Your little sister has married since you were gone. She has a baby now, instead of a doll. And your mother? She was watching Don's face carefully. The face was the same, the same clean-cut lines, the same eyes, but still different somehow, older, with an age beyond the measure of years, tired, too. How would Robbie look could she see him today? Don sensed that her thoughts had turned to her own son. "I ll never forget him," he said. ""He's given me more than I can tell you, and you first gave it to him." Mrs. Wynston's face was puzzled. She didn't understand. "Remember how you used to give him cookies when we were kids? Maybe you thought you were giving just to him, but there were always me and Slim and Spike and that crippled kid just around the corner. Robbie never ate those cookies alone. He always had enough to go around for all of us, even if he had to break them in smaller pieces. We ate them and thought you were swell, then. You could cook so well, and you never said 'No' to Rob when he went in for more. Well, we thought you were swell and we never told you." He paused as if the memory of those far-off years was good to cling to. She saw that there was a patch of silver hair like a streak over one ear. Don, no older than Robbie! Too young! Too young! "Well, Mrs. Wynston, there are some other fellows who think you're swell, but who may never get to see you to tell you so. The crew on Rob's plane. With them he shared things more satisfying than cookies, soul food that you had stored up in him. You know, Mrs. Wynston, a fellow does a lot of thinking when he knows his mission is to deal out - death from the air, when he wonders if he'll get back to his base again all in one piece." "\ His words were calm, quiet, and unemotional, but he saw the woman wince and he wondered if this comforted her. But he had to tell her how it was. He saw Camilla step watchfully to the front door. He saw recognition light up her face, and then she quickly retreated lest she intrude. "Well, a man's nerve is easily shaken at times like that. He finds out he's afraid, and it isn't fun to know you're a coward." No, it isn't, thought the woman bitterly. "But Rob gave us strength. He knew how to pray because you'd taught him." Like a miracle, she could almost feel the little lad at her knee lisping, "Dear Father in heaven, bless father, bless mother, bless?" She could almost feel the silk of his hair as she had when so often she had placed her hand upon his bowed head. ONLY HUMAN always near if We chose to call upon him. We didn't fee] so lost then," stowing family? So much to share with others while I've made no use of it myself. Her heart was overflowing with emotions she could not name, and then she said,  But if I could only know where he is now  A light warme3d Don s grave face. A light warmed Don's grave face. "Mrs. Wynston, Rob would say that didn't matter. He told us: 'Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .... ye are of more value than many sparrows.' Mrs. Wynston, our plane, the plane in which Rob flew on that last mission, we had called 'The Sparrow'. We had painted the word conspicuously on the nose. Believe me, it has not fallen to earth without the Father!" Oh, Robbie, how much you remembered! When he was small she had told him about the sparrows and he would fight any boy who threw a stone at a bird. "It's not only that your Heavenly Father sees you," he would say, "how would you like a giant or anybody to hit you with a stone?" No, Robbie was not missing. He was somewhere beneath the watchful eye of an all-wise Creator who had time to not even a sparrow fall. Wherever he might be, she, his mother, who loved him, did not know and could not reach him for she was only human, but he could never be lost outside the radius of God's blessings. There was peace in these memories. Words of counsel she had given in more courageous days had traveled far to return to her in her weakness. How could she have forgotten? But, wondering, she remembered other things. This boy had a mother, too, waiting, wondering, not knowing he sat talking only two blocks away. She must be selfish no longer. "I musn't keep you, Don. You don't know how much good you have done me. But your mother " "She doesn't know I'm coming. I wanted to walk in on her and find her doing the things she always used to do, baking, or dusting, or sitting with her mending." How can I tell him she's not doing so much of that lately, she wondered. "Things never stay the same, Don. We shouldn't expect to hold on to the past." She was talking as much to herself as to him, but her concern was for him. Would he understand. "You're tight, Mrs. Wynston, | to see the old town as I Deep down inside I knew 406 it was impossible. -You can't ever go back, really. Even the streets, the houses, aren't quite the same. They're a little older, a little more weather-beaten." "The war has changed everything, Don." "IT know it. Even little Susan Endell. I think I've loved her all my life, Mrs. Wynston, but I couldn't tell her so. Just the sight of her made me tongue-tied." He was flushed and boyish now. "She was so feminine and fragile looking. Well, this very morning as I walked past her house, there she was working in her garden. She wore a big straw hat and her face was flushed with exertion. There were freckles and a smudge of dirt across her nose, too, and because of it I forgot to be shy and before I knew it, I was kissing her and telling her all the things I've dreamed of for so long. And Mrs. Wynston, she said, 'Yes'. We're going to be married. I have a thirty-day furlough, you know. But it was the smudge on her nose that did it." "Maybe so," said the woman doubtfully. "But you've changed, too, Don. You're older and stronger and more sure of yourself." "IT don't know about that, but if I'd seen her in frills and furbelows I wouldn't have dared." "Well, I won't argue. Ill just congratulate you," and Mrs. Wynston was laughing quite zestfully. Camilla had come to the door again, her face puzzled by the sound of her mother's mirth. 'Hello, Don," she called. "Hi, Camilla. I'll see you later. I haven't been home yet, so I must get going." He swung through the old gate like a school boy. The hinges squeaked gaily. "Hey, don't do that!" shouted little Jimmy, coming up jealously. "My Mom won't let me do it." She won't? Thought Mrs. Wynston. Well, of course, hinges are harder to replace in wartime, but? She had a job to do. She must call up the Murphy's house and tell Don's sister her brother was on his way home, so she could prepare his mother for the surprise. They had never told him his mother had had a heart attack. They hadn't wanted to worry him while he was away. Besides, she was much better now, but a sudden shock, even though a pleasant one, should be avoided. * ek Kk & Camilla sat down weakly in the porch swing. The sight of her mother dashing up the steps and into the house was too much for her, but the firm, commanding voice giving its message over the phone was like music to her ears. When Mrs. Wynston had finished, she came out upon the front porch, and it was as if she had just returned from a long journey. Camilla looked up at her mother anxiously, but in the older woman's face she saw only vigor and courage and, more precious than all, deep love burning there for her daughter. Camilla's eyes filled with hot tears and she looked quickly away. But Mrs. Wynston understood. It's no more than I've done, she thought. I let her bear the brunt of my emotions. She uses a little rebuke to cover up hers. I must talk to her sometime, not now. But sometime, to let her know I understand all she has done. THE SETTLEMENT OF SANPETE VALLEY 407 The Settlement of Sanpete Valley (Continued from page 377) Sanpitch River. Two years later about fifteen Welsh families settled on the beautiful spot, and named the colony Wales in honor of their native country. Settlements began to dot the Valley from north to south, homes were built, the problems of supplying the necessities of life became less hazardous, and the settlers found time to turn their attention to new projects and cultural pursuits which augured well for the future of Sanpete Valley.
