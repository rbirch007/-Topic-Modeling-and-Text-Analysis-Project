SUMMER SONG Margery S. Stewart I think my front porch has a special grace, When small girls use it for a gathering place. What matter chipped-off paint and battered stair, When they, absorbed and grave, are playing there? At school or house, or baking angel cake. I must step carefully lest I should break Pies made of mud and pebbles; I must not walk Upon the dolls they fashion from the hollyhock. There are so many porches, bright and bare, With only ghosts of small girls Playing there.
