Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, June 1, and June 15, 1886 For THE Rights OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN of ALL NATIONS FAULT-FINDING: We are all too liberal in showing to the world the faults and weaknesses of our fellow beings. Why do we not stop and scan our own selves and see if all is well if we have not the misfortune to possess some little trifling faults, perhaps unperceived by us, still plainly visible to others? Faults that, however small they appear, will balance equally with the larger, and seemingly more important faults in our neighbor?... Let us cease all such immoral habits, and form in our minds resolves of reform; let us place, in the distant future, a mark to guide us as we journey on through life, and with that mark in view, let us strew along our pathways deeds of love, of kindness, and of truth, that we may thereby lay up treasures in heaven.

Whether you become great to correspond with that future is another thing entirely, and depends largely upon the uses to which you put the time allotted you, and the talents with which you are endowed. These may be many or few, but they are a sacred trust, a stewardship, for which an account must some day be rendered to the Almighty Giver. It is our duty to ourselves and society to prepare for the responsibilities which life imposes, and then discharge them faithfully and fearlessly. Address by Chancellor O. F. Whitney delivered at the graduation exercises at the University of Deseret. Page 396
