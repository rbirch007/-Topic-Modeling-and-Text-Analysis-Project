Erickson Page 417 418 Big Horn Stake (Wyoming) Lovell Ward ROM Big Horn Stake, under the presidency of Grace E. Allphin, the report of an outstanding evening of music has been received. The Singing Mothers of Lovell Ward presented a number of very beautiful renditions, including "'Holiness Becometh the House of the Lord," "Holy Redeemer," "Lift Thine Eyes to the Mountain," and "Let All My Life Be Music." The director was Carma B. Johnson, with Ada B. Baxter and Veoma Stahle as accompanists. The organ prelude was played by Sister Daisy A. Tew. So excellent was the rendition, and so satisfying the spiritual influence of this program, that Bishop Frank H. Brown of the Lovell Ward wrote the General Board of Relief Society the following comment on the performance: I am herewith enclosing a printed program for an evening of music presented by the Singing Mothers of the Lovell Ward Relief Society. It was one of the finest and most inspiring evenings I have spent for many years. The spirit of the occasion was outstanding, and the ability of the sisters in their presentation of the songs was of the highest type. The public was invited to enjoy this hour of music with the saints, and their pleasure and admiration were very great. You sisters of the Relief Society are to be congratulated on having in your organization a group known as the Singing Mothers. Many people have been brought closer to their Maker because of the very sweet services rendered by these sisters.

Fowler, an unusually effective program is reported by Louise Willard, President of El Sereno Ward Relief Society: "A 'Temple of Life' was constructed, and a program portrayed a radio broadcast by the Relief Society women. This was the introductory program of the year and presented a real challenge to our members. E] Sereno is anticipating the building of a new chapel and the theme of the broadcast was designed for this purpose. Invitations in the form of a miniature chapel were mailed to each woman in the ward. 2 I N c kd "When the sisters assembled to hear the broadcast, introductions were made by our first counselor, and Sister Marzelle Mangum sang "IT Love a Little Cottage." Then the announcer, Faun Demke, asked what each sister had to contribute toward the building of the chapel. Our president, Louise Willard, made a comparison of the erecting of temporal buildings to the building of character. She placed, as the foundation of the chapel, Faith, Truth, Humility, Love. "The social science teacher, Blanche Calvert, placed the stately pillars, Tolerance, Sincerity, Trustworthiness, Morality.

God-given Beauty was last added to this temple by Second Counselor Mary Snyder, when she placed Cheerfulness, Friendliness, Health, Understanding. "Marzelle Mangum sang "Bless This House," and Edna Kidwell gave the benediction. After the program each sister was given a pencil and paper and asked to either draw a plan or to write down the ideas she might have toward the construction and decoration of a perfect Relief Society room." Emigration Stake (Salt Lake City, Utah) Thirteenth Ward ILLIE C. ADAMS, President of Emigration Stake Relief Society, submits an account of the accomplishments of the Society in the Thirteenth Ward as reported by First Counselor Thelma Vetterli: "We have just completed an outstanding year of work filled with spiritual development and growth. Our greatest accomplishment was to acquaint the younger sisters of the ward with Relief Society work and interest them to the extent that they are now actively engaged with us as a vital part of the organization. 422 We engaged the services of a competent person to conduct a nurse and play hour for the young children during meeting. "We then gave these younger sisters a job to do and we made them feel needed. On work meeting day, this year, we inaugurated a monthly program luncheon to follow the usual work. The younger sisters have had complete charge of the luncheon and a master of ceremonies from this group arranged the programs and conducted them. To mark the difference from the old work and business day, we call it work and fun day. "We have used the general theme of "Friendship" and we note the birthdays of the sisters each month, making a little ceremony of presenting each Birthday Lady with a corsage. 'This simple act has brought untold joy to many. The speakers for the day are selected with the purpose of offering a wide variety of subjects, including some excellent demonstrations. During the season we presented a well-known local authority on ceramic art who brought with her a beautiful collection of antique and modern figurines. On another occasion, a demonstration of flower arrangements was given with suggestions on interior _and exterior decoration for the holidays. Another time a woman told of her life as a missionary in Tahiti. On this occasion, our members brought their personal treasures of all kinds, handwork and odd and interesting items. When we celebrated the 103d anniversary of the founding of the Relief Society, many ladies wore pioneer costumes and the feature of that day was a relic show. Many of these items had been carried across the plains by the pioneers. Included were furniture, pictures, china, books, and old letters bearing famous signatures. "Our class attendance on work and business day previously averaged twenty-two. It is now fifty-one." Maricopa Stake (Arizona) ROM Maricopa Stake, under the presidency of Vida D. Brinton, a report of an anniversary program presented in connection with the welfare assignment has been received through the stake secretary, Irene A. Duke: "At ten o'clock a. M. March 13, 1945, the Relief Society sisters arrived to decorate and arrange the ward displays around the sides of the spacious Mezona Hall. The center of attraction at the front of the hall was a beautiful Relief Society birthday cake and lighted tapers at each and of a lovely lace covered table. A profusion of spring flowers decorated the Hall and the tables in the banquet room where each ward served a delicious luncheon for all of its members at noon. During the luncheon hour, former Relief Society stake presidents were honored and presented with corsages. All other former and present groups of stake and ward officers were honored and asked to stand. Mothers with three and four daughters present were also paid tribute. "After luncheon, a unique program was presented in the form of a skit written by our stake Relief Society president, Sister Vida Driggs Brinton. Modern and old-fashioned costumes were displayed. NOTES FROM THE FIELD Two little girls from Tempe Ward, Anita and Carolyn Cox, dressed in modern and pioneer dresses, respectively, stood as announcers at the microphone while a delightful program of modern and old-fashioned music, songs, dances, and readings was presented by the different wards. Many of the Relief Society women were attired in pioneer costumes which created an atmosphere of yesteryears, bringing back loving memories and the spirit of our pioneer ancestors." 423 Maricopa Stake (Arizona) Tempe Ward Irene A. Duke, Maricopa Stake Secretary, reports the following item from Tempe Ward: "Early in the summer, President Lola O. Turley called her counselors together to make plans for a fall bazaar. Realizing the scarcity of cotton material and all types of children's clothes, Sister Turley suggested making all the items for the bazaar from salvage material. "From feed sacks, beautiful dish PAROWAN STAKE (UTAH), QUILT DISPLAY Pioneer quilt and modern quilt.

Their enthusiasm and co-operation have made a most successful season. This Relief Society is fully organized, the outline lessons are studied, and the special Sunday programs presented. In addition, the group has undertaken, as a special project, the serving of a monthly dinner for the servicemen. These dinners have been very successful and the proceeds have been donated to the branch building fund. "Our popular activity is sewing. Most of the sewing has been done for the March 17th bazaar.

Bateman is the 427 new Relief Society president, an interesting note on the recently organized Evergreen Ward has been received through the ward president, Gladys M. Rudd: "Our new stake is small in numbers but strong in faith, with powerful men to guide it. With only 130 families in our ward, our attendance is small, but we feel that the spirit of the Heavenly Father is with us. He has said that where only a few have met in my name there I will be also. "We plan to build a new stake house and chapel with our beautiful mountains as the background, a building where we can come to worship and enjoy ourselves.

Stoddard, former president, Northern States Mission Relief Society, submitted a report of activities in the Cleveland Branch, written by the president, Emma Glauser: "During the months beginning with October and including May, we have our regular Relief Society meetings. Our class leaders are faithful and capable Latter-day Saint women, Our visiting teachers make their regular visits and we try to accomplish this activity 100 per cent, but, due to the long distances the teachers must travel, this is not always possible. The Relief Society women have made many visits to the sick. They have stayed in the homes and in the hospitals when it has been necessary to do so. "A special activity for the past year and a half has been to give each expectant mother in the branch a baby shower. We usually have a large attendance and enjoy ourselves together. 'These occasions have made our members feel more united and have given them a greater understanding of each other's needs and a better acquaintance with the group." Western States Mission LUCILE B.

This year we have organized three new Societies: Fort Summer, New Mexico: Bridgeport, Nebraska; and Rapid City, South Dakota. The Clovis, New Mexico, Relief Society has been reorganized and is functioning again. We have four very fine district supervisors. Annie Ellsworth of Lubbock, Texas, supervises our East New Mexico District; Emma Allen, of Omaha, Nebraska, is in charge of our Winter Quarters District; Lucille Freeman of Grants, New Mexico, supervises the West New Mexico District; Marie Hymas has charge of the Scottsbluff and Black Hills District. All four travel regularly and report to me each week. Their splendid supervision is doing much to help the women in our outlying districts.

Workmanship, the quality, and the quantity. We have a large supply of new clothing and bedding on hand, as well as a huge chest containing cleaned and repaired used clothing. Bazaars and food sales have been held in many of our branches, in an effort to help raise building funds. In Sheridan, Wyoming, $500 was raised this year by a small group for this purpose. "Our October reports were really amazing the best attendance record in the history of the mission. Also, I am very happy to report that nearly 100 per cent of our organizations are holding a monthly preparation meeting. I feel that the fine condition of the organizations is largely due to their holding these planning meetings for unified, purposeful work. "My work has been truly inspiring to me. It is with reluctance I leave the Relief Society women of this mission." Work Meeting Mash-Sack Magic REGISTER Mary A. Hansen, President of the Uvada (Nevada) Stake Relief Society, reports an unusual sewing project which has helped to solve some of the urgent problems confronting homemakers at this time. "During these years," says Sister Hansen, "when the purchase of materials for household uses has been so difficult, many women have tuneed to substitutes. One of the questions frequently asked is, "These mash sacks, what about them? I understand that sheets can be made from them. What do you do to get them white?' "Because of this interest, our stake Relief Society board used the sack project last year. We bought two hundred and seventy-five sacks from the turkey growers for ten cents apiece. Each board member took some of the sacks to bleach and turn into something useful and lovely for our bazaar. "A wonderfully easy way to bleach these paint-marked sacks into snowy white cloth is as follows: Put about eighteen sacks, which have been opened by removing the threads and shaken to remove the mash dust, into a large tub and pour a gallon of kerosene (coal oil) over them. This amount of kerosene will just dampen this many sacks. Let them soak for several hours or over night. Page 430 Then, with hot soapsuds (the more soap used the more quickly the sacks will become white), put them in the washing machine for several minutes, wring out, and wash again with another strong soapsuds. Some sacks may require three or four washings for thorough bleaching. "Ironed well, the mash sacks can be easily made into many useful items for the home many things that we still cannot buy in the stores. These sacks can be made into beautifully decorated dish towels, tablecloths, pillowcases, sheets, boys' shorts, little girls' slips, women's pajamas, and many other necessities. "To make pillowcases, fold the sacks with the selvage at the top for the hems. This makes the cases wider. Put a crocheted edge on them, a bit of embroidery, and when they are starched and ironed they resemble linen. To make dish towels for a very special gift or for your own dishtowel drawer, buy a transfer pattern for use in making embroidery designs, or cut some applique patterns fruits, flowers, or leaves. Even plain, with nice straight hems, you will have dish towels that will be a welcome addition to the household linen closet. These are large towels and are very easy to launder. "To make a pair of pajamas for a WORK MEETING woman, use three and a half sacks: if the pajamas are to have short sleeves. Use braid, rickrack, or some attractive print from the scrap bag for trimming the white material. "Get a pattern and make your little girls some easy-to-launder slips for school. Make some shorts for your boys. Make yourself an apron with brightly colored trimming. "To make mash sacks into lovely little crib quilts, a sack is cut into sixteen even blocks. A little kitten, lamb, dog, or child design can be o 431 stamped on each block. When the blocks are embroidered and set together with colored material and quilted, they will be proudly studied and enjoyed by the small boy or girl. These quilts, fifty-two by sixty inches in size, will provide warm covers for cold nights. "To make something useful and beautiful out of 'practically nothing' is an achievement of which to be proud. Let us help to encourage the home arts, even to the use of a bit of mash-sack magic." Note: The directions for the project ""Let's Make Dickies" which appeared in the April Magazine were submitted by Sister Larene Lindquist of the South Salt Lake Stake; and the suggestions for making the '"'Grosgrain Ribbon Handbag," published in May, were submitted by Sister Blanche Hansen White of the Boise Stake. We wish to thank these sisters for their excellent suggestions. <> LITTLE QUAILS TAKE A WALK Lydia Hall They follow where their mother goes And try to match her stride; Though they are small, they all contain Large quantities of pride. It is adventurous, this trip Which now they undertake, And one with those that history gives To Raleigh and to Drake. There are so many dangers here, And they're so soft and shy; A sharp-clawed hawk is sometimes hid In the wide, velvet sky. But as they march through sun-warmed sand, Past scanty brush and stone, They view the world with wonderment And claim it as their own. Page 432
