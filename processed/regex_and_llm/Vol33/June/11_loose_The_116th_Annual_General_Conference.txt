The 116th Annual General Conference Ramona W. Cannon The many thousands who listened to the 116th annual general conference of the Church, held on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, April 5th, 6th, and 7th, 1946, were comforted by the proceedings with a deep sense of spiritual peace and joy, with inspiration to nobler living, and with the renewal of a pure and simple faith in God, his work upon the earth, and his promises of continued and glorified existence after death. The two meetings held on Friday, the two on Saturday, and two on Sunday, as well as the priesthood meeting held Saturday night, were all broadcast over Radio Station KSL. Elder John A. Widtsoe gave the Church of the Air radio sermon on Sunday morning, "Faith Under the Atomic Bomb," and at 9:30 A. M. Sunday, the Tabernacle choir rendered its 873d consecutive national Sunday broadcast. The opening and closing prayers by mission presidents and stake leaders were particularly thoughtful and appealing, imploring aid for the meek and suffering of the earth, for the leaders of the nations, for those who guide the Church, and for all Latter-day Saints. At the two sessions on Friday, April 5th, the music was provided by the Relief Society Singing Mothers of the Salt Lake region, under the leadership of Sister Florence Jepperson Madsen, member of the Relief Society General Board. The selections rendered were very choice and beautifully executed, and were inspiring to hear. The Singing Mothers and the Relief Society organization received high praise from President George Albert Smith and other speakers. The music of the great organ touched the hearts and brought a tender mood to the congregation. It was magnificent to hear and to see the vast throngs (probably numbering a full 10,000 at each session in the Tabernacle) singing with spirit the familiar and beloved songs of Zion. President George Albert Smith, in his opening talk at the first session, made reference to the spirit that becomes a part of certain places and buildings. In referring to the Tabernacle, he said, "It was erected in the poverty of the people and no other place like it may be found in all the world. Often, when it is vacant, there is a spirit here that you will find in few places in the world. Many people have come here on a busy weekday as tourists, and as they have come under the shadow of this roof and looked through the building and have seen this great organ, with everything quiet, many of them have been moved to tears by the inspiration and influence they have found here." Much of President Smith's address was devoted to the theme of the closeness of God to his children. "What a comfort it is to Page 393 394 realize that there is no mistake about it, we are the children of our Father in heaven, that he does love us... That he does interest himself in our affairs. We are here as sons and daughters of the living God, trying to work our way through until we shall be worthy of an exaltation in the celestial kingdom. What a privilege it is!... I hope that we will come with a prayer in our hearts that those who address us may draw the inspiration from our Heavenly Father necessary to feed his flock." President Smith made a plea that the President of the United States, and those working with him, might live in such a way as to merit the guidance of God. He also expressed deep sympathy for the suffering people of Europe. In the priesthood meeting on Saturday evening, he spoke of the value of an individual testimony of the gospel, and marveled how people could lose their faith by substituting the philosophies of men for the revealed truth. "The philosophies of men... Will never lead anybody into eternal happiness, nor help them to find a place in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father," he declared. At the opening session of conference, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Read the financial report of the Church. Those listening were gratified by the growth of the Church as revealed in its financial matters, and rejoiced in the account of the welfare work accomplished, especially the sending of carloads of clothing and food to the suffering European saints. Saturday morning, President Clark in his address, stated that the only way to obtain relief from the sorrow, apprehension, and anxiety that overshadow all of us, is to have a firmly rooted testimony like that of Job: "Yet in my flesh shall I see God." He cited other great testimonies connected with the life of the Savior, such as those of Simeon, Anna, and Peter's great utterance recognizing Christ as the Son of the living God. The same kind of testimony, he stated, actuated the Prophet Joseph Smith and has actuated Church members up to the present day. Anyone desiring a testimony may, through prayer and living the commandments of God, obtain such a testimony through the ministration of the Holy Ghost. President Clark, at the priesthood meeting, called for a unity of the priesthood, stating that such unity "would wield an influence that would affect the course of world affairs. He read and briefly answered a list of ten heretical doctrines that are creeping into some Latter-day Saint circles and are destructive of faith. President David O. McKay spoke, on Saturday morning, on the forthcoming Centennial celebration of the coming of the pioneers to Utah, to be held May 15th to October 15th, 1947. He reported that, on account of the shortage of housing accommodations for tourists, the celebration will be principally by and for the people of Utah. Besides using the best that home talent can produce, it is proposed to bring to the State some outstanding educational and entertainment features, symphony orchestras, stars of stage and screen, a national eisteddfod, and sports events. President McKay asked that all citizens co-operate with the mayor and officers of Salt Lake City and other cities of the State in their efforts to reduce lawlessness and vice. He urged the beautifying of our surroundings. "Every man, woman, and child in the State should sense a responsibility to do something to make the State clean and attractive." He stated that the appearance of churches, seminaries, and other Church properties should be improved by suitable landscaping, by painting, and by effecting needed repairs, and that vacant lots should be cleared of weeds and debris. "Make Utah a rose garden by planting additional bushes in every yard; remove all dead trees from the landscape," President McKay also suggested. Speaking on the same subject? the Centennial Elder Stephen L Richards expressed the hope that Latter-day Saints would do their utmost to make this consecrated land "reflect here the minds of those noble men and women who left it as a heritage to us." A letter from Elder Ezra Taft Benson, who is presiding over the saints in Europe, was read Sunday afternoon by President George Albert Smith: Destruction, hunger, and anxiety are on every hand. Many of our saints are without home or country... In the midst of all this there is but one soul-satisfying refuge, the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. The faithful members of the Church face the future with courage undaunted. This is in great contrast to the melancholy, suicides, and discouragement all around them. Powerful testimonies to the divine calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith were given by many of the speakers, who declared that an impostor cannot make history, nor wear the mantle of a prophet. Elder Albert E. Bowen drew a parallel between the iconoclastic writers of the present, who "debunk" George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and those who approach the Prophet Joseph Smith, and even the Savior of the world, in the same fashion. He exposed the spurious nature of some documents strongly relied upon as furnishing support for certain assertions concerning the Prophet. President George Albert Smith stated that those who belittle the Prophet Joseph Smith "will be forgotten in the remains of mother earth and the odor of their infamy will ever be with them, but honor, majesty, and fidelity to God, exemplified by Joseph Smith and attached to his name, will never die." Among the other subjects stressed by speakers at this conference were the great need for missionaries to carry the gospel to all parts of the earth, and the necessity for Latter-day Saints to uphold the Constitution of this country which guarantees our freedom, bought at so dear a price by our forefathers.
