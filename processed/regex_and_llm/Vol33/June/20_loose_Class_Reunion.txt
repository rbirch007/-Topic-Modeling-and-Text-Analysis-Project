CLASS REUNION Olive M. Nicholes Time's measured tread along the campus ways Brings memories back ? one old friend with me still ? As burgeoning of spring, and summer days Point to the crimson sumac on the hill, Bleak winter's sculptures, and the barricade Of crystal bridges on the silent stream. The locust shrills a haunting serenade Where lovers' Jane is but a happy dream, And phantom classmates climb the hill with me, For you, alone, remained to give it grace. Time blots the years with rigid certainty, But grants me largess in your smiling face. Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for 'Notes from the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104.
