IN SIBILANT REGRET Courtney Cottam When Autumn fills October's solitude With anthems born in loneliness and grief, The twig-lace shadows emphasize its mood Of quietness; each sere and frost-crisped leaf, Drifting to earth, intones a slow motet; A song of sorrowing and soft lament, Fall's requiem in sibilant regret, | A broken whisper from its soul, now spent. My heart, in close affinity with fall, Stirs with strange moods, primeval and intense, Stalking the years, entangling my soul; It is as if some haunting, distant call Binds with the Autumn's earthy, pungent scents. The sorrow-songs of earth into one whole. GOLDEN NUGGETS OF THOUGHT A charming little book that everyone likes. Pocket size carry it with you. Choice quotations from the writings of the wise.
