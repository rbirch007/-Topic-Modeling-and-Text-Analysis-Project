OUR GOAL Evelyn Fjeldsted Would we be like the stones that lie Against a quiet, nameless hill, Where spring skies bend to measure rain But only sand dunes move at will? If we were all inanimate, The storms of life, so ominous, Would be unknown. Oblivious peace And silent depths would shelter us; But then we would not see the light, The hope-filled promise of each day, Nor could we search for priceless truth That blesses with its every ray. The builders once rejected stone; No rock shall be our shining goal. We must have faith until the truth From all earth's discord frees the soul.
