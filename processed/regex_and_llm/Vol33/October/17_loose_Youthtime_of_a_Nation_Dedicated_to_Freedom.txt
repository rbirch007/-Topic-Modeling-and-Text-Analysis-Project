Youthtime of a Nation Dedicated to Freedom Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, January 21, 1947 IP VAN WINKLE by Washington Irving, is at once a delightful old tale and a portrayal of contrasts. Before the henpecked Rip wandered off and fell into his long, strange sleep, his home town was a quiet Dutch village with its quaint folk and quaint colonial ways. When he awakened twenty years afterwards, and wandered back home: He found the house gone to decay? the roof fallen in, the windows shattered, and the doors off the hinges.... He called loudly for his wife and children; the lonely chambers rang for a moment with his voice, and then all again was silence. He now hurried forth, and hastened to his old resort, the village inn but it too was gone. A large, rickety, wooden building stood in its place, with great gaping windows,... And over the door was painted, "The Union Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle." Instead of the great tree that used to shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, here now was reared a tall naked pole,... And from it was fluttering a flag, on which was a singular assemblage of stars and stripes. All this was strange and incomprehensible. He recognized on the sign, however, the ruby face of King George,... But even this was singularly metamorphosed. The red coat was changed for one of blue and buff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a scepter, the head was decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large characters, GENERAL WASHINGTON. There was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the door, but none that Rip recollected. The very character of the people seemed changed. There was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it, instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquility. He looked in vain for the sage Nicholas Vedder,... Or Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, doling forth the contents of an ancient newspaper. In place of these, a lean, bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of citizens, election, members of Congress, liberty- Bunker's Hill, heroes of seventy-six and other words which were a perfect Babylonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle. The appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled beard, his rusty fowling piece, his uncouth dress, and the army of women * and children that had gathered at his heels, soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They crowded round him, eyeing him from head to foot, with great curiosity. The orator bustled up to him, and... Inquired "on which side he voted." Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but busy little fellow... Inquired in his ear "Whether he was Federal or Democrat."... "Alas! Gentlemen," cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, "I am a poor, quiet man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the King, God bless him!" Here a general shout burst from the bystanders: "'A tory! A tory! A spy! A refugee! Hustle him! Away with him!" It was with great difficulty that the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order. Rip, as those who know the classic story will recall, finally was brought out of his tangle of troubles, restored to his children and friends. Gradually he came to a realization of some of the revolutionary changes that had taken place during his protracted sleep. He was told that there LESSON DEPARTMENT had been a war that the country had thrown off the yoke of Old England and that, instead of being a subject of His Majesty George the Third, he was now a free citizen of the United States." Rip was indeed not the only one who was a bit bewildered over the changes that had come to America. It took many of the freed people some time before they could adjust themselves to the new liberties they had won. In the light of what is happening in various countries over the earth today, with freedom thrust upon them by the second world war, it should not be difficult to picture our own nation in its youth time. There was just one basic difference then and now: young America had no clear, set pattern of self-government to follow. This, in large measure, had to be constructed. Words from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address state with force and clarity the serious problem that challenged the leaders who founded our country: Four score and seven years ago our Fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. ) That was a grave question with many who saw the rise of young America and even helped in shaping its beginnings would the nation live and last as a democracy? Folk, long accustomed to live under a monarchy, had sincere misgivings as to the outcome. Winning a war is one thing; winning a just and lasting peace is an- 703 other. It takes, as all the world is right now - beginning keenly to realize, the highest wisdom of peace loving leaders to resolve a conflict ?to turn the hearts and minds of men from destructive to constructive ways of life. Can we do it now? War, like a magnet, draws folk of different classes together to make common cause against a common foe. It was so with the Thirteen Colonies. Unity brought victory; what then? Naturally, with the enemy of all vanquished, there was a tendency for each colony to go its Own separate way. Would America, thus weakened, fall to another strong power? Will the nations, torn by dissensions, lose today what was so dearly won? Something of this kind, remember, happened to the Children of Israel. Led by Joshua, they had retaken the "Promised Land." Then, each of the tribes resettled its assigned portion. With the unifying force that had held them together during the conquest lessened, they suffered repeated attacks from surrounding enemies until they began to clamor for a king. This, Samuel, the great high priest, at first denied them; but when the word of the Lord came to the effect that the foolish people, having forsaken God, should be given their own unwise way, a king was appointed to rule them. Would youthful America repeat such history? Some felt strongly that a monarchy would be best for the new nation; and one went so far as to propose to Washington that he be king. The suggestion brought a stinging rebuff to the one that made it. In his poem "Washington 704- the Nation Builder" Edwin Markham wrote: When fortune flung him a crown, he flung The bauble back and followed the people's dream. How then, if not as a monarchy, could the young nation survive? How could the lofty ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence be maintained? How might there be builded a "government of the people, by the people, for the people," that would "not perish from the earth?" A clear, sound answer came through another inspired document, the Constitution of the United States. This great charter of our liberties, we should remember, came as a rich fruitage of centuries of struggle and sacrifice on the part of patriots. It sets forth, with clarity and force, basic principles of freedom for which they fought and sometimes died. Its prime originality lies in the fact that here, for the first time, the world was given, in writing, a solid foundation for liberty. Our young nation wisely adopted it as the "Supreme Law of the Land." Its central purposes are clearly set forth in the preamble: We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this CONSTITUTION for-the United States of America. "We the people" is the phrase of most vital significance. It represents a long climb upward from "I the king." It was clear recognition on the part of the framers of the Constitution of the prime source of fundamental rights and power in government: these rest in the people. Officers chosen freely by popular vote are but representatives of the people who honor them by such selection. This was made plain in the great charter. The Bill of Rights ten amendments specifically protecting the people in freedom of religion, of speech, of the press, and in other rights was adopted in 1791. These fundamental, and natural rights are now, as someone has said, "ingrained in our American natures." Many folk, who enjoy the blessings of peace and protection of their precious rights under our Constitution, seem to take these for granted. They appear to think little of the long years of struggle and devotion to great principles that it has taken to give us this bulwark of our liberties. If they did, they would bow their heads in gratitude for the patriotic men and women who gave their lives for liberty; and for the Founding Fathers whose vision, devotion, and courage gave us a new charter for the freedom they won. It was with a heart full of gratitude for these blessings that Joseph Hopkinson created, in 1789, the first of our national anthems, to be sung at the inauguration of our first president, George Washington, who had justly won the tribute: "First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen." With the background of this study to add significance, lines from that old song will ring with new meaning: Hail Columbia, happy land, Hail! Ye heroes, heav'n-born band, Who fought and bled in freedom's cause, Who fought and bled in freedom's cause, LESSON DEPARTMENT And when the storm of war was gone, Enjoyed the peace your valor won! Let independence be our boast, Ever mindful what it cost, Ever grateful for the prize, Let its altar reach the skies. Sound, sound the trump of fame! Let Washington's great name Ring thro' the world with loud applause! Ring thro' the world with loud applause! Let ev'ry clime to freedom dear Listen with a joyful ear; With equal skill, with steady pow'r, He governs in the fearful hour Of horrid war, or guides with ease The happier time of honest peace. Refrain: Firm, united let us be, Rallying round our liberty, As a band of brothers joined, Peace and safety we shall find. While Washington, who had spurned a kingship, and had presided over the group of men who framed the Constitution, is naturally to be accorded first place among those Founding Fathers, there were other statesmen who should not be forgotten. Benjamin Franklin gave ripe wisdom to the work; Alexander Hamilton added his helpful contributions; while James Madison, not only gave invaluable assistance, but preserved an official and also intimate record of the proceedings. Besides these there were other fine, devoted minds to aid in laying the solid foundation for our new nation. Let it not be thought that this was to be the end of the building. It was indeed, only the beginning of a daring venture. Days immediately ahead would test the firmness of the structure that had been raised. Not only that, but the people themselves had to learn how to conduct themselves in accordance with the basic rules for self-government laid 705 down, or what they had built would be destroyed. Washington, as first President, had to meet serious internal disturbances like that of the "Whisky Rebellion." With firmness and justice he dealt with the problems, and strengthened the young nation. For eight years he guided its destinies through sun and storm; then, refusing a third term of office, he retired to a well-earned, less arduous service as proprietor of Mount Vernon. Respect for our new. Nation was being won at home, with pride growing in its achievements. How to win it abroad was the serious question. How to keep out of entanglements with foreign powers, as Washington in his Farewell Address advised, was an ever-present problem. It is still with us. During the youth time of our: country, England and France were in an almost constant state of war. Both these nations rather arrogantly encroached on our rights as a free power; there was disregard, especially of the "freedom of the seas." Our Yankee ships came into clash with these and other offenders. Finally, during the administration of James Madison, a second war came with England. Fortunately, because Great Britain's hands were full with the struggle to defeat Napoleon, this War of 1812?so-called?was of comparatively brief duration. It was at this time that our stirring anthem "The Star Spangled Banner" was created. A brief analysis of that song will serve here in two ways: First, it will help to show the spirit of the young nation; and second, it should help us to sing the song with deeper understanding and more fervor than is usually done. Remember, first, that it was created during a critical battle. A British army had just taken our national capital. President Madison and his officers had been forced to flee. 'The British fleet, flushed with triumph, suddenly appeared before Baltimore, another key city, and launched an attack on Fort-McHenry, above which floated the Stars and Stripes. Francis Scott Key, a young American lawyer, trying to arrange for the freeing of a friend who was on one of the enemy ships, was held prisoner there while the battle to tear down his country's flag was on. Through the long night he paced the deck anxiously, waiting the doubtful outcome. Finally, to relieve his feelings, he took from his pocket a letter, and on the back of it wrote the lines that have rung down the years. Anxiety, uncertainty as to the battle's outcome, is the spirit of the first stanza: Oh say, can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming! In other words, is our flag still flying? Is the poet's troubled question. O say, does the star spangled banner yet wave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?" The second stanza is one of recognition and answer to the first. Morning breaks, and? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,; What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines on the stream; Then comes the line of joy and triumph? "Tis the star spangled banner! May it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. Oh, long The third stanza, sometimes omitted, yet a vital part of the song, is a taunt to the foe in defeat: And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more? Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. Finally comes the crowning stanza one of dedication: Oh! Thus be it ever, when free men shall stand Between their loved homes and the wat's desolation! Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just, And this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.' And the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  LESSON DEPARTMENT In light of this brief analysis, how unthinking and unappreciative is the common practice over the country of singing only the first stanza of our national anthem. If time permits of just one stanza, certainly 't should be the last one. This breathes the true spirit of our America, It has profound meaning for our nation always. Our flag ? symbol of liberty through righteousness has inspired poets through the years. Another lyric created during the youth time of our nation by Joseph Rodman Drake, vibrates with the joy and uplift inspired by Old Glory. Following are typical stanzas from this poem "The American Flag." When Freedom from her mountain height Unfurled her standard to the air, _She tore the azure robe of night, And set the stars of glory there; She mingled with its gorgeous dyes The milky baldric of the skies, * And striped its pure, celestial white With streakings of the morning light; Then from his mansion in the sun She called her eagle bearer down, And gave into his mighty hand The symbol of her chosen land.  Flag of the free heart's hope and home, By angel hands to valor given; Thy stars have lit the welkin dome, And all thy hues were born in heaven. Forever float that standard sheet! Where breathes the foe but falls before us, With Freedom's soil beneath our feet, And Freedom's banner streaming o'er us? Dr. Timothy Dwight, one of the earlier presidents of Yale University, also gave us an ever-popular song of intensely patriotic spirit. Its first stanza follows: O Columbia, the gem of the ocean, The home of the brave and the free, The. Shrine of each patriot's devotion, A world offers homage to thee. Thy mandates make heroes assemble, When Liberty's form stands in view; 707 'Thy banners make tyranny tremble, When borne by the red, white, and bine All these, and other poems, are expressive of the spirit that brought our young nation into being and held it true to its course through the earlier years. In that same spirit of true patriotism, of trust in God, the author of liberty based on righteousness, America has carried on thus far triumphantly through all its testing difficulties. And, if our nation remain true to its divine trust, it will continue to be a land of freedom? a pattern for all the rest of the world. Discussion and Activities 1. A.
