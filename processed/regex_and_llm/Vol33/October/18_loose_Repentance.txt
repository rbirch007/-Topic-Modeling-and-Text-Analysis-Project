Repentance Elder T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, January 21, 1947 REPENTANCE is listed as the second principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ, following logically the principle of faith. When one has acquired and developed an abiding faith in God and the saving power of Christ's atoning sacrifice, it is natural to seek release from the painful remembrance of one's former unrighteous conduct. The process by which this release from the consequences of sin is attained is the God-given principle of repentance. Sin is the violation of the pattern of living that is pleasing to God. Any departure from the course that God has given for the welfare of his children falls into the classification of sinful living. Many, however, are in great need of a repentance from wrong-believing and unChristian teachings. Until there is a repentance from these errors of doctrine, there can be no true acceptance of the atonement of Christ or the concept of a loving God and Father. To hold to erroneous beliefs would be offensive to God and *Latter-day Saints distinguish between a universal or unconditional salvation and a conditional or individual salvation, including exaltation. President John Taylor wrote: "He (Jesus) bore the weight of the sins of the whole world, not only of Adam, but of his posterity: and in doing that, opened the kingdom of heaven, not only to all behevers and all who obeyed the law of God, but to more than one-half of the human family who die before they come to years of maturity, as well as to the heathen, who,  LESSON DEPARTMENT, 709 having died without law, will through His mediation be resurrected without law, and be judged without law, and thus participate, according to their capacity, works, and worth, in the blessings of His atonement." (Taylor, Pres. John, Mediation and Atonement, pp. 148-149). We read in the Articles of Faith: "The individual effect of the atonement makes it possible for any and every soul to obtain absolution from the effect of personal sins, through the mediation of Christ; but such saving intercession is to be invoked by individual effort as manifested through faith, repentance, and continued works of righteousness.... Exaltation is given to those only who by righteous effort have won a claim to God's merciful liberality by which it is bestowed.... In the kingdom of God there are numerous degrees or gradations provided for those who are worthy of them; in the house of our Father there are many mansions, into which only those who are prepared are admitted." (Talmage, James E., Articles of Faith, pp. 89, 91). Keep the one who believed in them estranged from the love and forgiveness that God desires to grant to those who seek him with repentant hearts and receptive minds. The process of repentance is a step-by-step change in life, voluntarily done on the part of the penitent wrongdoer. One theologian has named these steps, "Recognition, Remorse, Resolution and Retribution the Four R's of Repentance." They represent a good summary of the process by which one seeks to change his life and become a worthy Christian. Before one can commence the work of repenting, there is need to be aware of having sinned. This brings the person to a condition in which he recognizes the nature of the sin that has been committed, and he becomes convinced that he did wrong. This first step is often one of the most difficult in the entire repentance process. We are so prone to justify our own conduct, that we have difficulty in convincing ourselves that we are guilty of wrong-doing. Nephi spoke of this condition of human frailty when he said: Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink. And be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us. And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God-he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.... And thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell (II Nephi 28:7, 8, 21). Once, however, having gained a conviction that there has been a wrong done, the next step should be a regret or feeling of remorse because of the evil that has been committed. Unless this feeling of sorrow enters the soul, there is little likelihood that there will be any true repentance. 'There are innumerable souls who do wrong, frankly admit it, but seem to feel no remorse as a consequence of their acts, and go gaily along the path of continuous sinning. However, if the remorse is really present, the sinner desires to be relieved of the effects of the sin? both upon himself and upon others if they were involved by his conduct. In this condition, he seeks his Maker, supplicating for forgive- ness and confessing his sins. 'The confessing of sinful conduct is one of the greatest benefits that comes from repentance. 'The Lord has instructed us that we are required to confess our sins and stated that this was the test of real repentance. By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins behold, he will confess them and forsake them (Doc. And Cov. 58:43. See also 19:20; 42:88-92 and 61:2). 'The act of confessing, although painful, has a wonderful effect upon the soul, giving it a new view of God's love and forgiveness, and a feeling of having overcome the sin, through recognition of it. Surely the embarrassment of confession is a small price to pay for the priceless boon of a relieved conscience and a feeling of oneness with God which it brings. There follows a third step that is necessary in the repentance plan. Recognition of wrong-doing and regret are not sufficient. The-test of the genuineness of repentance comes in the determination of the former sinner not only to forsake his sin, but in the resolution to sin no more. This is, of course, another test in the process to gain release from sin. True repentance consists of forsaking the sin and returning to it no more. The success of the repentance process is measured at this stage by the firmness and sincerity of the resolution to sin no more. One who has been caught in the act of sinning may be forced to go through the first two steps because of external pressure brought to bear upon him, but the resolution to refrain from future sin is a matter of the will, not of force. If possible, the repenting sinner should, lastly, undertake to make restitution for the sins already committed. Sometimes this can be done by returning stolen goods or money, giving service to those against whom the sin was committed, or making other compensation for the evil done. In other cases a sincere confession of guilt or an apology may suffice. In still other cases, the retribution may have to remain on the mental level of improved thinking, that sinful beliefs may no longer hamper the free exercise of the mind. The apostle Paul, following his conversion, devoted his life to the Christian cause, feeling this to be the least that he could do to compensate for the evil that he had performed when persecuting. The Christians. In this way, he hoped to make the restitution as great or greater than the sin for which he held himself accountable. The parable of the prodigal son is an excellent illustration of these stages in repentance. After the willful separation from his home and family, and at the end of a period of sinful living, the young man found himself engaged as the most menial of all the hired laborers on a farm a feeder of swine. Famine prevailed, and he envied the hogs who were able to eat, wishing that he might partake with them of the unpalatable husks upon which they existed. At this stage, the parable records, "he came to himself," that is, he came to recognize his sinful life. He had remorse as he thought of his former home and envied his father's hired help, who were much better off than he. Then came the resolution, "I will arise and go to my father."  LESSON DEPARTMENT Here was the resolution to leave his sinful world. At home again, he said, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, And am no more worthy to be called thy son:" He was seeking only to be classed as one of his father's hired helpers (Luke 15:11-32). Jesus pointed out in this ever-new story the steps that occur in the process of a sinner finding himself and returning to his God. In this dispensation the Lord has given specific commandments to the Church concerning its responsibility to preach repentance. 'To Hyrum Smith he said, "Say nothing but repentance unto this generation." To John Whitmer, the Lord said, "".... I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring souls unto me...." (Doc. And Cov. 11:9; 15:6; see also 16:6; 19:21). To Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer was given this glorious promise with their call to missionary service: Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance. And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth! Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, 71 and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! (Doc. And Cov. 18:10-15) Repentance is more than just a routine by which the sinner repents and accepts God and finds his Savior. It is a continuous process that must be practiced throughout life. Our concept of eternal progression should teach us that we must continually strive to repent of bad habits of action and thinking, and replace them with better ones. These again must give way to still greater improvements in habits of thought and conduct until we overcome all sin. Repentance is a principle of growth that should be practiced along with faith throughout mortality. Questions and Activity Problems 1. In what sense is confession a part of true repentance?
