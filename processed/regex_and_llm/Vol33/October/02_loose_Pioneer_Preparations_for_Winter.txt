Pioneer Preparations for Winter Ann P. Nibley Member, Relief Society General Board HE pioneers of Utah were a thrifty, industrious, self-reliant, and ingenious people. For several years after their settlement in the Great Basin they were alone and isolated, far removed from the comforts and luxuries of civilization they: had previously known. When they came to the West, they had no other possessions than the small amounts of food and clothing which they carried in their battered and worn handcarts and wagons. Anything more than that, which would add to their sustenance and comfort, they had to produce and manufacture after their arrival, with the labor of their hands.. Living as they did in a country where the four seasons were definitely marked, each season called for its specific tasks. Spring was the time to plow and plant; summer was the season in which to irrigate the crops, destroy the weeds, and cultivate the soil; fall was harvest time, the time when the grains, fruits, and vegetables were gathered and stored; winter was the season when nature rested, and man took care of his possessions and waited until the ever recurring miracle of planting and reaping could again be repeated. The harvest season was the busiest time of the year for the pioneer family and, probably, the most challenging. With a realization of their isolated condition and remoteness from sources of supply, it was most important that they should conserve and preserve, for their use and sustenance, all products of garden, orchard, and farm. It was also necessary for them to provide and prepare warm clothing for winter use. From the earliest settlement of Utah and throughout the pioneer period, wheat appears to have been the principal crop, for from time immemorial, this staple grain has been considered "the staff of life." An effort was therefore made by each pioneer family to produce enough wheat each year to ensure an adequate supply of flour until the succeeding harvest. Threshing day on the farm was always interesting and satisfying. While the work was heavy for the men, the mother's task seemed the greatest of all. As Lavine Bennett has written in "Harvest Time in Pioneer Days:" The mother's task was great. With few conveniences, she would have to start days in advance to get her salt-risin' bread ready and enough baked to supply the threshers. The meals were prepared from food grown on the farm home-cured pork, dried corn, squash, potatoes and dried apple pie for dessert. The threshers' breakfast consisted of mush and cream, ham or eggs and mutton chops and eggs, hot biscuits and molasses or fruit.... And some people served pie or cake: When tables were not long enough they had to be lengthened with lumber from the farm. Table cloths, if used, were supplied by the neighbors. When the signal was given that the meal was ready, the threshers would all line up at the kitchen door and wait their turn to wash their faces in a little tin wash basin that stood on the stump of a tree or a long wash Page 651  bench near the kitchen door. When the meal was on the table, from four to six young ladies would be stationed around the table with long willow boughs to keep the flies away while the hungry threshers ate. Frequently, after dinner, the good housewives would invite the neighbors in for a piece of old-fashioned jelly cake, mince or squash pie, doughnuts or cider, and the evening would be spent in telling stories, singing, and dancing. Straw, the by-product of wheat, was also an important item, and its use again showed the resourcefulness of the pioneers. After the threshing was over, newly washed bed ticks were filled with fresh, clean straw, and placed as a foundation for the feather beds which were made of feathers from geese, ducks, and chickens. Straw was also laid down under the cleaned rag carpets. It was used for making hats and brooms, for bedding down animals in the winter, and as a covering over vegetables in the pits to keep them from freezing. ANY discussion of wheat and its importance brings to mind the great grain-saving project given to the Relief Society, in 1876, by President Brigham Young, the object of which was to store wheat for a time of need; and also the fact that for nearly seventy years a supply of hundreds of bushels of wheat has been carefully conserved and kept constantly available. In addition to their many household duties and responsibilities, pioneer Relief Society women not only collected wheat and funds for this cause, but they personally went into the fields after the harvest and gleaned to add to their wheat supply. Corn was another valuable crop in the early days. It was harvested in the fall and provided food for both men and animals. 'The husks and stalks were used for ordinary fuel as well as fuel for smoking fish, hams, and bacon. Corn husks were also used for filling mattresses. Many pounds of sweet corn were dried and enjoyed during the winter. Popcorn was also raised and carefully dried for use during the coming months. With the manufacture of molasses, it became a popular article and was soon well known in all the settlements. During the long winter evenings, great pans of this corn were popped on the kitchen range and, with the addition of molasses, delicious balls could be made which were especially welcome on birthdays or at Christmas time. Sugar was an extremely scarce article during pioneer times as it had to be brought from the Missouri River in wagons. When available, it sold as high as two dollars a pound. Many who craved sweets and were unable to obtain sugar, tried to satisfy their appetites by boiling down squash, carrots, and beets. Then came the raising of sugar cane. This crop thrived well in the valleys and was harvested in the fall and made into molasses. Later, bees were raised and the honey was used for sweetening fruit, for making candy, as a spread for bread, and as an ingredient for cough medicine. Beeswax was also made from the honeycomb. A great variety of vegetables was raised by the pioneers as early as 1848, such as potatoes, squash, carrots, onions, cabbage, and beets. A good share of these was preserved for winter; some were stored in pits, PIONEER PREPARATIONS FOR WINTER while others were put away in the thrifty farmer's cellar. Beans and peas were dried and stored for winter, although some were reserved for planting, as were other seeds of vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Squash was dried out in the open air as-well as by hanging it from the rafters of the farmer's kitchen. Fruit trees were planted during the first few years after the arrival of the pioneers.. Apples, peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, grapes, and currants grew and yielded abundantly. As early as 1855, one writer noted that "Dr. Richards' house was half hidden by a splendid orchard and garden, while orchards and gardens lay behind and around the mansion of Brigham Young." Peach and apple time was one of the high lights of the harvest season, and apple-paring bees and peach-cutting bees were a worthwhile and fashionable pastime. On these occasions, the young people of the community would all "turn out" together and spend the day or evening cutting and spreading the precious fruit on boards under the trees or on the low roofs of houses or sheds to dry. "It was surprising how much could be accomplished and, except for some badly stained hands, they were none the worse for the work." Later in the evening, there was the serving of refreshments, and dancing to the music of, perhaps, a violin, French harp, harmonica or accordion. It was not uncommon, if it happened to be a moonlight night, for the young people to serenade on their way home. In preparation for winter, the industrious pioneer woman excelled in making jams, jellies, and preserves, both from orchard fruits and also from wild berries such as chokecherries, bullberries, and ground cherties which grew in abundance on low, bushy vines in fields and gardens. Courtesy: The Children's Friend PIONEER CANDLE MOLD They also put up many kinds of pickles, made mincemeat, plum puddings, and Christmas cakes. Hops were gathered in the fall and laid by for the making of yeast and root beer, and herbs such as catnip, yarrow, and peppermint were gathered for the making of medicine. It was customary in the early days for every farmer to raise hogs. After the animals had been fattened with com in the fall, "hog killing" took place. From these, the women made head cheese and sausage, rendered lard, salted bacon, and cured hams. In some instances, meat was cured by being put in liquid brine. From scraps of fat they made soap. Cattle and sheep were killed occasionally in the community and the fresh meat was greatly enjoyed. Beef suet was prized for use in the making of plum puddings, which were made six and eight at a time and hung in the cellars until they were needed, to be steamed for some festive occasion. Beef suet was also used in the making of mincemeat. Mutton tallow was used for making candles and also for the making of salve for chapped hands. After the grain and the fruits and the vegetables had been harvested and stored for winter, it became a custom to celebrate the occasion by harvest festivals. It is interesting to note that the first of these festivals was held on the tenth of August, 1848: The season was one of scarcity, although there was no serious famine. The seagull miracle had happened a month or two before, and the settlers were truly grateful. This festival was a grand affair amid humble surroundings. A bowery in the center of the old fort had been erected, and underneath its beneficent shade, richly and bounteously laden tables were spread. There was bread, beef, butter, cheese, cakes, pastry, green corn, watermelons, and a great variety of vegetables. Parley P. Pratt describes it thus: "Large sheaves of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and other products were hoisted on poles for exhibition, and there were prayers and thanksgiving, congratulations, songs, speeches, music, dancing, smiling faces, and merry hearts. In short, it was a great day with the people of these valleys, and to be remembered by those who had suffered and waited anxiously for the results of a first effort to redeem the interior deserts of America." (Laura Angell King, "Harvest Time in Pioneer Days," Daughters of the Utah Pioneers. ) FTER the harvest festival, the attention of the busy housewife was turned to the making of clothing, bed and table linen. Most of the sewing, knitting, and quilting was done in the winter months after the heavy fall work was completed. Wool was washed, carded, spun, and dyed by pioneer women, and the yarn used for the making of stockings, socks, and mittens. Wool was also used for the making of quilts, the weaving of linsey for dresses, and for wool sheets and blankets. I have heard my beloved grandmother, Temperance Ann Doney, tell of helping to shear the sheep, washing and spinning the wool, and making it into linsey cloth, of dyeing the yarns by means of roots and plants gathered from the fields. With these colored yarns, she made various shades and plaid materials with which she sewed dresses and suits to clothe herself and her five little girls, her husband, and her two sons. She also made and sold rag tugs and carpets. I have also heard my grandfather, Samuel R. Parkinson, relate how his wife made his suits for several years from buckskin which they had tanned themselves. Flax was raised successfully' in Utah in the early days and woven into linen. Many of the tablecloths, sheets, and towels, also much clothing used at that time, were made from this material. Underclothing and bed linen were made principally of unbleached muslin which was obtained from the local stores. The making of quilts was an important part of the pioneers' preparation for winter, and quilting bees were very popular, as they gave opportunity for recreation as well as work. Latter-day Saint women have been famous down through the years  PIONEER PREPARATIONS FOR WINTER Courtesy, The Salt Lake Tribune 655 PIONEER SPINNING WHEEL for their beautiful quilt making and, today, their lovely quilts are among the most popular and sought-after articles sold at the Mormon Handi craft Gift Shop in Salt Lake City. Another important preparation for winter was wood hauling. On the day appointed for this enterprise, ox teams and horse and mule teams, attached to wagons and running gears, could be seen wending their way along the dusty roads to the canyons. In the evenings they would return with their logs. Sometimes this process was kept up for several days as wood must also be procured for the "meeting-house" and for the "widows of the ward." When all the necessary wood had been hauled, a "wood supper and dance' was held. What a feast this would be as the sisters brought steaming kettles and pans filled with meat and vegetables, chicken pies, "spicy pickles, preserves and shimmering jellies," doughnuts, and delicious cakes, and every appetizing food known to the group! It was then spread on long tables in the ward hall. After the dinner, the tables were cleared away "and soon was added to the sweet confusion of laughter and cheerful conversation, the merry strains of the violin and the strong, clear voice of the prompter directing the dancers through the mazes of quadrilles, Scotch reels, French fours, and other figures of harmless dances suitable to the manner and religious character of the participants." The pioneers were socially united, and they made a great deal of their work in preparation for winter a pleasure. "Their common interests and problems made them unselfish and charitable. They shared and, in their kindness to one another, they found their greatest joy." They exchanged labor; neighbor helped neighbor in gathering and storing the crops; and they mingled together as one large family. The pioneers have left us many valuable lesson, but none greater than the lessons of thrift, resourcefulness, self-reliance, and ingenuity which enabled them to survive in the desert and found a prosperous empire.
