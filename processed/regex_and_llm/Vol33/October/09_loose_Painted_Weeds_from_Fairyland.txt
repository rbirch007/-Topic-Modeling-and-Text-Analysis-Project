Painted Weeds from Fairyland Rosella F. Larkin President, Twelfth Ward Relief Society, Mount Ogden Stake, Utah GLIMPSE into fairyland was enjoyed by more than two hundred friends who recently called on Mrs. John W. Stahr at her home on Twenty-seventh Street, Ogden, Utah. The occasion was the fifth "painted weed' display of this unusual artist. A few years ago, while Mrs. Stahr was taking long rides out-of-doors to regain her health, she found beauty everywhere, in grass, wild flowers, and even in so-called weeds, and, visualizing the added effect which colors would lend to the beauty of their arrangement, this artistic lady proceeded to apply bright-colored paints to make their beauty carry over into the drab months and drab moments of life. Milkweed pods take on a new aspect when tinted blue and pink; hollyhocks stand tall in a gorgeous variety of brilliant, colored blossoms. Pastel-colored vases hold graceful fans of June grass. Other containers hold goldenrod, sagebrush, sunflowers, yarrow, thistle, cocklebur, pigweed, alfalfa, catnip weed, dill, arnica, verbena, wild mint, and greasewood, The flower display includes hydrangeas, black-eyed Susans and lilac seeds. Grains, such as wheat and oats, make attractive arrangements. In this picture, Mrs. Stahr stands amid her fairyland, holding in her hand a pink clay pot containing a bush holding a bird's nest made of brown cockleburs, and a bluebird molded in clay. This is her special "happiness" gift to her friends. She has found the great secret: Find your happiness in whatever you do, Wherever you are, with whatever you have. It is the only happiness you will ever know. Mrs. Stahr is an active Relief Society worker in the Twenty-fourth Ward, Mount Ogden Stake, Utah. Page 673
