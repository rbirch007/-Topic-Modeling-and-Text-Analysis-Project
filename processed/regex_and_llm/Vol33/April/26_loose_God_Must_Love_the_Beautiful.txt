GOD MUST LOVE THE BEAUTIFUL Mabel Jones Gabbott God must love the beautiful; He made his world so fair, He crowned the earth with hills that stand Jewelled in the high blue air; He nestled lakes among the trees, And curved the seas with care. God must love the beautiful; His heaven, high and free, Splashed with brilliant patterned stars In chorused harmony, Circles round about his world, With gleaming symmetry. God must love the beautiful, What colors he has planned: Pink and white of blossomed trees, Ocean-tinted sand, Greening fields, and earth-brown clod  All fashioned by his hand. Page 286 Let's Make Dickies GPRING is here in all its glory. How about a "Dickie Day" for the Work-Meeting Tuesday? A change of dickies gives an old suit a teal rejuvenation. Where shall we get the material? Dickies require comparatively small pieces of material and they are easily cut. The only shaping necessary is at the neck, back and front, and a slight slope to the shoulder. Let's look in the scrap bag. Here is a piece of lawn. A twenty-inch length by a_ twelve-inch width will make a plain front. A strip one-inch wide, when finished down the front with narrow rickrack, and a bow at the neck to match, makes an interesting finishing. If there is enough material, the back of the dickie may be cut of the same material as the front. If not, a bleached sugar sack will do as well. Make an opening in the center back seven or eight inches long. 'This same style works nicely with plain or corded rayon and rayon rickrack. Tape is placed about one inch from the bottom and tied on each side to hold the dickie firm. Now, find a piece of georgette about seventeen inches wide and twenty inches long, plus some scraps for a bow, and we shall soon have another dickie. This one will be pintucked in groups of threes, three C4 = groups on each side of the front. Shape the neck, then make a net back which has an eight or nine inch opening down the center back, and bind the neck with a bias piece of the georgette. At the center front, place a bow made of a double piece of georgette. Pin tucks, lace, and insertion will work together effectively in a dickie of either lawn or batiste. A frilly jabot may be added; or the dickie may be left with a plain neck. A discarded organdy evening dress may be used to advantage in making sheer dickies. The tail of a man's shirt makes a neat, easily laundered dickie. These, and many otherwise unused materials, may be used advantageously in a "Dickie Day Project."
