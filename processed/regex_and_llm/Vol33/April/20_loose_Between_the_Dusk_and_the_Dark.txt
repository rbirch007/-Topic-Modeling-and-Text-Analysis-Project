Between the Dusk and the Dark Alice Whitson Norton 66 BETWEEN the dusk and the dark did you ever stop to think of that one hour in the day, what it means to the countless mass of people who go and come by the clock?" asked a tired little saleswoman one afternoon, of a thoughtless customer who sat at one of the lace counters in a big department store, carelessly fingering the laces. "No," said the customer, "I never thought that that particular hour could mean very much to anybody; to me it's the hour that means I must be hurrying home in order to be there when my husband gets in. He is very particular about my being in the house when he comes home." "Isn't it wonderful," responded the saleswoman, "to be waiting for a kind man at the door of a home at the twilight hour?" "Sounds well enough for one who's never experienced the feeling," laughed the customer, "but to me twilight means getting home in time to let my husband in nothing more." With that, the customer arose and made a hasty exit, and the saleswoman turned to me, who, being a customer, was awaiting my turn to be served. "Funny expression, wasn't it?" she said with a meaning nod towards the departing figure. ""That's all some people see in the twilight hour but to me " "You must love the twilight hour," I interrupted. "Love it?" she asked, "It's the Page 264 sweetest time of day to me that one hour between dusk and dark, when every home-loving person begins to seek his own shelter." This statement was new to me, and believing the young woman on the other side of the counter had a vision worth sharing, I questioned her further. "I�ll call it the ecstasy hour," she said presently, "for in that one hour of the day I honestly believe that joy rules the world. You see," she went on softly, "it's the one hour in the whole twenty-four when people seemingly leave off their troubles  the thought of going home fills their minds, and trouble and business worries are laid away. You can feel the spirit of joyousness in the crowd that jams the street-cars at the twilight hour, and in their faces you can almost read what awaits them at the end of the journey. "You'll see the tired little mother eagerly watching for the glimpse of the street lamp where she leaves the car; the weary father leans anxiously towards the little bell on the car wall three blocks before it's time to ring it. The young husband, pretentiously reading the newspaper, folds it six blocks from his stopping place. That's the street-car side of it. Of course, that's a very small part now, for so many folks go and come in autos and buses. Even the auto, to me," laughed the girl, "plays an important part in this home-coming hour of mine." "You are quite an observing young lady," I said, by way of response. BETWEEN THE DUSK AND THE DARK "Perhaps," she answered, "I am a little too observing but back to the home-coming hour: I happen to live in the North Street triangle apartment house, and from. My window I can view three streets, and from close observation, have learned a lot about home-comers.� �FOR instance," she continued, "I often sit at the window and watch the cars come down Long Avenue. I can tell almost at a glance just where they are going to stop. One car, with four blazing lights, turns the corner slowly, stops before the biggest house on the street; then, even more slowly than the car approached, a man gets out and drags himself wearily up the long walk. Indifferently he turns the keys in the door and goes in." "Why indifferently?" 1 asked. "Because," answered the young woman, "nobody lives there but himself." "One little two-eyed car turns the comer like an ice skater, making a curve, and rolls swiftly to the curb before a tiny house. The driver gets out and, going in, is in keeping with the movement of the car he's in a hurry to get home." "You're sure about that?" I asked. "Quite sure," she answered sweetly, "there's a wife and baby waiting for him within the little house." "Next," she went on, a bit slowly, "usually comes a small coupe. This car belongs to a business woman. She drives her cat just as cate fully as she manages her business, and doesn't stop until she's inside the garage." "Ts she in a hurry?" I questioned eagerly. 265 "No," said the saleswoman, "she is neither rushed nor slow. To her this coming home hour is just part of the busy day. 'True, she has her parents to look after when she arrives, but, having provided for their comfort before she left home in the morning, she feels no need to hurry in the evening. "Then, there is another cat " For a minute the speaker paused and I was just beginning to feel as if she were going to leave off the most important one of all, when she smiled bravely. "I know it," she continued softly, "the instant it turns the curve on Long Avenue, because it doesn't run as smoothly as the others do, for the driver has only one arm, but as it comes wiggling up the street, my heart seems to come right up into my mouth, for in it comes the most lovable man in the world. He is my  my husband. We met each other in the twilight, we were married between the dusk and dark he enlisted in the great World War, between the dusk and dark, was wounded in action just as day was kissing the world goodbye. He came home bruised in body and broken in spirit, and for months it seemed as if nothing could save him. It was then that I began to work at this store, and, coming home one evening in the dusk, I found him waiting for me with a smile. So you see," she fin- 'shed softly, "what the home-coming hour means to me." "I see," I answered huskily, "and henceforth and forever the twilight hour will have a new meaning for me the home-coming hour the hour when troubles are laid aside in the joy of coming pack to those we love."
