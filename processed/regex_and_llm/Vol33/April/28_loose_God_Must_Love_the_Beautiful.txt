GOD MUST LOVE THE BEAUTIFUL Mabel Jones Gabbott God must love the beautiful; He made his world so fair, He crowned the earth with hills that stand Jewelled in the high blue air; He nestled lakes among the trees, And curved the seas with care. God must love the beautiful; His heaven, high and free, Splashed with brilliant patterned stars In chorused harmony, Circles round about his world, With gleaming symmetry. God must love the beautiful, What colors he has planned: Pink and white of blossomed trees, Ocean-tinted sand, Greening fields, and earth-brown clod  All fashioned by his hand. Page 286
