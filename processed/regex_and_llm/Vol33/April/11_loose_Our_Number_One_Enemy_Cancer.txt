Our Number One Enemy Cancer Compiled by the Field Army, Utah Division of the American Cancer Society HAT is cancer? Cancer is not a disease. It is the wild growth of lawless "gangster" cells that infiltrate the surrounding area and, if not treated or removed in time, "metastasize" (that is, break off and travel in the bloodstream or in the lymphatic fluids to other positions, where they set up in business again). The result is death to the individual by interference with vital organs, either at the site of the original growth or at a new site after metastasis. We dread cancer above all other diseases. Therefore, it stands rightly among the causes of suffering and death as mankind's Number One Enemy. Every year scientific advances make it possible to save more people from cancer. Every year we grow older, however, cancer increases as a personal danger. The race between these two factors is the vital thing which concerns us. Weare concerned with it in every age of life. Even among babies, children, and youths, cancer takes an appalling toll. This year it will kill nearly 2,000 American boys and girls who will never live to see their twenty-first birthday. Statistics indicate that between the ages of five and nineteen years, cancer kills more children than all of the following diseases combined: scarlet fever, infantile paralysis, typhoid fever, meningitis, peritonitis, diphtheria, dysentery, diarrhea, and malaria. One in every six deaths among people of middle age is caused by cancer. Even among the aged, cancer is not as high a cause of death proportionately. Thus, a vast number of cancer's victims are stricken when still at the height of their powers fathers and mothers with dependent children, men and women whom society and business can least spare. The Facts We Must Face The proportions of the cancer tragedy are shocking. Cancer killed 607,000 Americans between Pearl Harbor and V-J Day  more than twice as many as were slain by the Germans and Japs. Right now, cancer is killing 175,000 Americans a year 478 every day twenty every hour one every three minutes. Cancer is the greatest killer of American women between the ages of thirty-five and fifty-four the second greatest killer of American men. In America today, it is estimated conservatively that more than 700,000 persons are suffering from cancer, and the total may approach 1,000,000. Yet, we can face with real hope facts even as terrible as these. When detected in time and treated effectively, cancer can be cured in a large proportion of cases. In ninety-five per cent of the cases, cancer of the skin or lip can be cured in its early stages cancer of the breast or uterus in seventy-five per cent of the cases, if treated in time. It is estimated Page 245 246 that, on the basis of present knowledge alone, from thirty per cent to fifty per cent of all cancer can be cured through early recognition and effective treatment. For our nation as a whole, the cancer death rate is still alarmingly on the increase. But in those communities or among certain groups or citizens, where people have learned to recognize the danger signals of cancer and have proper facilities for treatment to which they turn quickly, cancer death rates are beginning to go down. For instance, one of our large insurance companies recently reported, for the first time, a definite downward trend in the cancer death rate among its white industrial policy holders over an entire decade. We ought to be turning the tide, however, not just for a part of our people, but for all of our people. This year, due largely to the efforts in which the American Cancer Society has played a leading part, the lives of 30,000 Americans will be saved from this terrible disease. But at least another 50,000 will die needlessly. They will die mainly because they lacked the knowledge to seek help early enough, or did not get the treatment they needed. We also have failed so far to do as much as we should to relieve the terrible suffering of those who cannot be saved and to increase constantly the proportion of those with good hope of salvation, through an adequate program of research. What We Must Do. We must press a comprehensive and relentless attack against cancer, upon all fronts through education, adequate treatment, and_ research. To do this, we need, first of all, an effective means for organizing and directing the fight against cancer. The basis for such an organization was laid in 1913 with the founding of the American Cancer Society. Although handicapped by insufficient funds, it pioneered the educational program which proved that an ever-increasing number of lives can be saved. The American Cancer Society now has enlisted the highest leadership, both medical and lay, that can be had. Last year it established a beachhead for a really comprehensive attack on cancer. With the aid of the National Research Council, it began the organization of a far-reaching program of cancer research. This year, it plans not only greatly to increase its research, but to increase facilities for the treatment of cancer patients. It is essential that people learn to consult a doctor at the first sign of possible cancer and that new and better ways to fight cancer be found through research. People must have places to turn for effective treatment. No matter what programs the government may propose for the study of cancer, there remains the need for private institutions to carry on cancer and other related basic research. In order to make a real start toward providing better care for cancer patients, the goal of the American Cancer Society this year is to raise $12,000,000. Utah's goal is $35,700.00. This will provide funds for more and better diagnosis in cancer clinics, including x-ray film and radium, to help establish cancer OUR NUMBER ONE ENEMY CANCER detection centers at key points within the State, to help establish Visiting-nurse service for care of can.
