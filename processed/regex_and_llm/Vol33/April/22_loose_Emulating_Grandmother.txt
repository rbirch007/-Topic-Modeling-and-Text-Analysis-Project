Emulating Grandmother Linda S. Fletcher THE occasional angry chord that T crashed out from the piano under the touch of Elaine Norris' fragile-looking, but very strong, pale hands betrayed the indignant climax to which her thoughts kept building. The emotional turmoil thus expressed had been started on its incendiary way by her husband's suggestion the previous evening after dinner, as they were enjoying a game of dominoes in their comfortable living-room, that they join a group which was planning to rent land and produce a four-acre vegetable garden. For a moment Elaine had been stunned by the proposition. Then: "But, John," she had almost wailed, "my music my Hands!" Elaine had always thought of her hands with a capital "H." John had smiled just a little, she remembered, as he had paused briefly to place the domino which had scored him a "twenty." "But it won't be as bad as all of that," he had assured her soothingly. "There will be a dozen families tending the garden, and so we shall each need to spend only a few hours two or three evenings a week to keep it in a first-class condition. I think it will be good for us to work in the soil." "I'm sure I'm in very good physical condition," Elaine had retorted haughtily. "I do my exercises every day." "But I'm sure you'll find a few unused muscles if you get to tending a garden," John had smiled in return. "But my USO work," Elaine had further protested, "and the Civic Opera! And do you forget that I am doing almost all of the work in keeping up this big house? As for you  don't you get enough contact with Mother Earth in caring for our grounds?" "With Tommy Wells mowing the grass, I don't have too much to do. A couple of hours in the morning will give me time to keep things in good condition. And you will not have to give up your weekly evening at the USO. I wouldn't want you to be unable to play for the Service Men's Broadcast. As for the opera the work in the garden at that time will not be so heavy that you'll be prevented from assisting with its presentation. Everyone, now, should raise a garden." "But you and I can afford to buy what we need." "Of course if there is food to be had. But I look at it this way, with Mary and Beth both moving so frequently from place to place in order to be with their husbands, they aren't going to be able to do any canning, and I'm sure Robert will be much better fed in the army, if we help to increase the food supply for ourselves here at home." Elaine's eyes had softened then, as they again softened now, and nostalgic notes throbbed from the piano. Her three children had departed almost simultaneously from the home nest, leaving the big house very empty. Though she had left much of their care to others, Elaine Page 269 270 had loved her children dearly, even if her accustomed aloofness toward everything except her music had prevented her demonstrating that affection. Under this softening spell, she had agreed rather vaguely that perhaps they had better join the garden group, and she and John had turned to the discussion of other things. THIS morning, however, alone at her piano for her usual several hours of practice, her resentment flared anew. John knew how carefully she must guard her hands, those members which had been given such painstaking care for as long, almost, as she could remember. "Your hands are just like Grandmother Elaine's,' her mother had told her, as she was growing through the period of small girlhood. "If we take care of them, you may some day become the great concert pianist which she gave promise of being." And John knows, too, that I don't care for intimate association with people that most of them bore me, Elaine told herself. This dwelling apart had begun early for Elaine, for while still very young, she had given proof that she had inherited, at least in some measure, her grandmother's gift. Her whole family had been trained by her mother to cherish her "Hands," though not without some grumbling on the part of her two sisters when they had to wash the dishes, scrub the floors, do the laundry, and perform numerous other tasks that the mother had thought would coarsen and stiffen Elaine's cherished fingers. To do Elaine justice, she had spent long hours practicing and had really become the outstanding musician in the small town where her family lived. Later, due to her mother's indomitable determination, the family's limited resources had been taxed to send her to Salt Lake City for further study. There, she had developed adequately, if not brilliantly. But before many more years had passed, various auditions had proved to her that she lacked the spark of greatness. Rather than admit this, however, she had married John Nomis, a young architect who was fast becoming well established in Denver. This marriage had given her the excuse for not attempting a concert career. They had been able to afford a maid almost from the first days of their life together, and later, a cook and a gardener. John had encouraged her to keep up her music, feeling, as Elaine had agreed, properly contrite that he had accepted so great a sacrifice at her hands. She had soon established herself in the musical circles of Denver, where her services were soon much in demand in connection with various civic enterprises. So meticulously had she devoted herself to her piano ever since that, even now, when she was well over forty, she was still considered one of the city's leading pianists. She was vaguely conscious at times of late, however, that there were better musicians who could take her place and she had to stifle a desire to let down a little she did have to practice very hard to keep up and give these younger ones a chance. EMULATING GRANDMOTHER UT habit was stronger than the voice of this inner desire. That was why it had dismayed her so much to lose her maids to more desirable employment, Now, she was able to get a woman only twice a week, and that at an exorbitant wage, grateful that she owned so many labor-saving devices and that the place Was in perfect repair, Otherwise, she was sure she could not have managed to keep it up, Something an impelling force within her had told her what she must do. Now, in addition to all of this, she had promised John, that she would assist in do8ing even more unaccustomed tasks. Of what had she been thinking. But, perhaps there be much work for her to do at the garden, after all. Toom and ended in 4 circling landing that gave access to the several Tooms on the second floor. Made from an old tintype and exhibited it proudly, although she laid much more stress on her ancestor's on her Pioneering achievements. Elaine's mind worked that way. Ere was the same oval face, with its wide-set haz. El eyes; the same golden-brown hair, "Grandmother," she told the portrait softly, "I know that if you could give me advice, you would tell me to cherish my ability to play well above was denied you. Well, don't worry, dear, wherever you are. I won't let you down. I�ll keep our music where it should be first and fore. Most. You had to give up your life of culture. I don't have to forsake Grandmother smiled serenely 272 down upon her. Grandmother did not look like a frustrated woman, Elaine thought, uncertainly. Her first few times at the garden bore out Elaine's belief that it would make but few claims upon her. A man who had the implements came to plow and harrow, and she and John drove out to survey the work he had done. Elaine found herself unwillingly aware of the sweetness of the early spring evening. It seemed to her the materialized spirit of great music. As the evening advanced a little, and moonlight whitened the earth, she felt that the silvery cadences of The Moonlight Sonata had become visible beauty. It was not until several weeks later that Elaine began to realize how demanding the garden was to be. John came in one evening to tell her that all of the women who could go would be needed the following evening to help in their first big planting of beans. "Well, I can wear gloves," Elaine promised herself. But the beans were hard to control with gloved hands; too many rolled out at a time. Finally, she removed the gloves and really got interested in placing her beans into the rows as fast as the other women could drop theirs. After a very short time, however, her muscles began to protest. So she was in condition, was she? She remembered her boast to John, and pride made her work doggedly on. Soon she got her "second wind" and was able to finish triumphantly. When John inquired rather anxiously as they were driving home how she felt, she answered that she was fine. "Not so much out of condition as you would have me believe," she laughed gaily. "Well then," he told her, "you'll be available for the corn planting tomorrow night." THUS it was that Elaine found herself planting corn the following evening. This wasn't as hard as the bean planting had been. She found she could stand upright and toss the kernels exactly where they should go. She helped plant corn again the next evening. However, when John made ready to go to the garden for the fourth consecutive time, Elaine protested. "But you said we'd have to spend only two or three evenings a week there," she reminded him. "So I did," agreed John. "However, the corn must be planted. We should have had it done if we had had a large enough turnout the other evenings, but we didn't, so those of us who will come out will have to complete the job. Of course, you don't need to go unless you want to." But Elaine found she had something within her that wouldn't allow her to be a quitter. She was rather chagrined the next day to find that she was too sleepy to practice effectively. She decided that she had better take a short nap. On her way up to her room, she paused before Grandmother's picture. The eyes above her seemed to twinkle. "I suppose that's why you went on, too," Elaine thought. "When there was a job to be done, you couldn't quit, either." Now, as weeds began to make their appearance, the garden became more and more demanding. Elaine hoed EMULATING GRANDMOTHER without regard for her hitherto carefully tended hands. Blisters and then callouses appeared, but she could not stop. The hoe could not remove the weeds from between the plants, therefore Elaine took off her gloves that she might carefully pull these by hand. Would they ever be able to catch up with the intruders! It seemed not, for there was never more than half of the garden group present to work. "If everyone would come out and help, we could keep this garden looking as it should," she wailed to John. Because the work was so pressing, Elaine found herself reluctant to take time off for the USO. She wasn't really needed there. 'There were others, younger women, who could do the job as well as she could, and she knew that the soldiers, for all their appreciation, preferred that the girls play for their song fests. Therefore, after a few weeks, Elaine automatically put on her slacks and went to the garden each evening. It was payment enough to see those tows of vegetables become clean and sturdy. "Well, Grandmother," she told her ancestor's portrait, as the protests within her subsided and were being replaced by patient contentment with her exacting work, "I'm getting to know you better, You found joy in doing a worthwhile job tight and were willing to take the consequences, just as I am." Soon the canning season arrived, and the days became crowded from dawn to late at night. To Elaine, it seemed that a new woman was emerging from the aloof, cool chrysalis of her former self, which had dwelt apart as the rather mechanical interpreter of music. The 273 piano was now much neglected; certainly the masters were, for Elaine found that when she sat down to the instrument, new melodies clamored for expression. Her fingers wandered over the keys, striving to give these life. HERE was something of the garden in these melodies and even something of the community canning kitchen and the people who worked there with her. The melodies also held the deep contentment which she felt at the end of each work-filled day. And now she found herself set. Ting down notes: a Piano concerto was being born. She had never dreamed that she might compose! In the concerto she traced wonderingly her contact with reality  with truth. Here, was the mauve of evening, the flame of sunset, the satisfaction of toil, the rhythm of growing things, and the expanding of a soul. Here, also, was the fruition of the harvest the jade, ruby, and gold treasures of the storehouse. Elaine played her composition exultantly. Interpreting the music of others was a delight, but in creating something of truth and beauty herself, her most marvelous experience had come to her. "So that was your secret, Grandmother," she told the portrait after her awakening. "You knew the supreme joy of creating, and your whole life, consequently, made music, 'Tm glad I'm truly like the real. You, now, Grandmother. I am not merely 'Hands,' but mind and heart as well." The inner Elaine has been set free.
