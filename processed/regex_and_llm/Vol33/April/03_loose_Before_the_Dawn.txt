Before the Dawn Alice Morrey Bailey There is an hour of darkness in the night Beyond reflected rays of yesterday, Too early yet to catch the coming light Refracted from tomorrow' s newest ray. THE quotation, 'The darkest hour is just before the dawn/' is more than a matter of night and day, more than a certain num-ber of hours each of hght and dark- ness in the minds of men. This bit , of philosophy was perhaps created to hft the heart, heavy with burdens, and to shed the hght of hope into the darkness of despair. The "darkest hour" in the hves of men is made up of various ingredi-ents, not the least of which is dis-couragement and self-doubt at the soundless falling of carefully built structures of hope, when one stands in the ruins of a cherished theory, or counts the cost of time and effort that are now rubble at his feet. Pasteur, Koch� all the truth-seek-ers in the field of science are famil-iar with this form of darkness. Banting, an obscure Canadian doc-tor was one of these. February ii, 1922, Fred Banting was in his laboratory at the Univer-sity of Toronto. With him were two men. One was Charlie Best, his faithful helper through months and weeks of grilling research, nights of sleeplessness, and days of anxiety, while they had pursued an elusive, life-saving truth that had come to Dr. Banting in a flash of in-spiration during the night of Octo-ber 30, t wo years before. The other man was Joe Gilchrist, Dr. Bant-ing's dear friend, who was dying the slow, starving death of diabetes. This night was the culminating point, the night when their long fight was to be given the test� whether this new medicine would work on humans as well as it did on dogs. No one but a desperately sick man would have submitted to that test, for its failure might mean death. They fed him an ounce of pure glucose and tested his breath to see if his body would burn it. Of course it wouldn't! They shot the new medicine in with a hypodermic, and waited� one hour, two hours. Noth-ing happened. Banting was sick at heart. His medicine had failed. It was the old story! What would work on dogs might not work on hu-mans. Not daring to look at Joe, he left to catch a train. * � � * A differ e nttyp e of "dar k esth o ur"oftenco mestoonewh o has fought too hard for some prize, has paid too high a cost, and, having at-tained it,f inds that it is dust and ashes in his hands. In this category are all who forfeit morality, virtue, or honesty for people, possessions, or causes� things that may seem in and of themselves to be fine and desir-able. And yet "The leopard never changes his spots," is a human doc-trine, foreign to the teachings of One who died between two thieves. Those who have gone beyond the Page 221  222 moral boundaries are most in need of the helping hand. They have lost the power to discern tight from wrong; they are most dependent upon the clear and unselfish thinking of others, after floundering in a sea of confused values. Creative people are particularly prey to moods of exhilaration or despondency, so  much so that fits of "temperament" are expected of them. Perhaps itis because emotion is an integral part of creativeness, and emotion is by turns a flatterer and a depressant, but never a reliable pair of spectacles through which an artist may view his own creation. Robert Louis Stevenson, at Sherryvore, Bournemouth, England, once wrote feverishly for three days on a new story that had come to him in a dream ten thousand words a day, while the household went about masterpiece, finished, called his wife and her son, Lloyd Osbourne, sn and read them the manuscript with an intensity that made shivers Tun UP and down Lloyd's spine. When Stevenson came to the end, gazing Up at them in triumph and self-satisfaction, waited for the outbreak of enthusiasm from his wife, whose fine powers of criticism and analysis he relied upon. "Robert, you have missed the whole point," she said. "You've missed the whole allegory." angry, Lloyd trembling from the room, and his mother in tears to her apartment. RIGHTEOUS indignation at un just treatment is justifiable, but it is effective only when something can be done to relieve the situation, to undo the wrong: Henry Collins Brown sat in the hopelessness of an insane asylum contemplating suicide. He felt that death was a door behind which were the mental door; that he had the power to tum it, with every reason to do so, and no good reason not to. He had lost his lifework. He had formerly been curator and founder of the Museum of the City of New York, into which position he had put the best years of his life. He had fought for the preservation of valuable historical relics, for a home in which to collect and care for them. He had delivered many learned lectures and solicited funds for the cause. For many ye" he had struggled against the indifference of people until he had accomplished his He knew that, whether he lived or died, the museum was established and the work would go On, It was then that the Museum officials decided he was too old for the job he was sixty-five and removed nim, supplanting him with a "popinjay" from the West, who had never seen New York, and who affronted the cultivated patrons of the institution. Dr. Brown went down un der the weight of these injustices an from overwork. He believed there was nothing left to live for; it was too late to start over again, and this seemed to be the end. BEFORE THE DAWN These are isolated pictures of seemingly different human crises, but they have some things in common, as all human beings have certain things in common. As mortal beings, all people are subject to disappointments and even defeats which are inevitably to be met in one form or another during our sojourn upon the earth. The bottom drops out of the bucket of hope. Nature betrays the young; death assails security. Each man may look at his neighbor with envy, thinking he sees a man with no burdens, no problems. The soldier returning with the loss of an eye or an arm does not see spiritual death, mental and moral cripples, in the physically whole. The beautiful dreams of aspiring souls peace, brotherhood, wise parenthood, unselfish love and religious perfection are more often ideals to strive toward rather than realities which are ours. Nevertheless, they must be striven for, because they can be achieved, and simply, too, by obedience to divine and eternal laws of truth. "He that loseth his life shall find it," said Jesus. Death was not the end for him, but a new and glorious beginning. The morning of the resurrection was sweet and fair. The brightest hour in human history was when Mary, stooping to peer into the tomb, saw the empty linens of death, the angels robed in white at the foot and head of the tomb, and when Jesus revealed himself to her, asking: "Woman, why weepest thou?" (John 20:11-16). The Son of Man was not only personally victorious over the great enemy of life on earth, he laid a pattern through death to life again that every man can and will follow. 223 Moreover, the words of his wisdom, that fell some two thousand years ago on the ears of herdsmen and farmers, high priests and moneychangers, are still the patterns of wise living, and in no less measure applicable to men of today.... "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free," he told them (John 8:32). CHARLES Banting had been doing just that seeking the truth to make men free. His story might well have ended on that night of September 11, 1922. The short time and sparse materials allotted to him for his research had been used long since. Any day now he would be dismissed by the more important heads of the institution, who had no patience with his harebrained idea anyhow. His thoughts were dark with discouragement as he boarded the train to go to his home. He didn't know that he had left too soon, that, back in Toronto, Charlie Best was saying: "Let's have another go at it, Joe," and that Joe was breathing much better, that suddenly, after months, his head was clear again and his legs had lost their heaviness that he was able to eat a good supper, after which he took a stroll, grinning and "walking on air," as he put it. By the time of Banting's arrival at his home the news had been telephoned, and Banting was given the message that freed millions from death by diabetes for Banting had discovered insulin. So narrow is the margin between success and failure! So small is the 224 moment when the heart touches bottom and wavers between disaster and the will to go on! Robert Louis Stevenson brooded for three days over his disappointment in his wife's verdict. Finally, he called her in, told her he had accepted her judgment, and, over her tearful protests, threw his feverishly written manuscript into the fire. If he tried to mend it, the result would be a patchwork of good and bad, he declared, so he was going to write it over! He wrote steadily for three more days, 10,000 words each day, and the tenth day after he had begun it, he sent off to the publishers the manuscript, replete with significance and rich with allegory, that lives to this day as one of the greatest stories ever to come from the pen of an author Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. can forgive, but I can't forget," is another fallacy humans cling to, though it is entirely foreign to the gospel of "seventy times seven." Dr. Brown, now gone down the long hall, beyond reach of human influence or the written word, reached toward the knob of suicide on the door of death, and, as he teached, he learned some eternal truths, notably that lack of controlled thinking had put him where he was, and that self-control was the only road back. He took that long way back, slipping many times, losing ground that had to be regained. With part of his mind "mislaid," the rest of it went on functioning. He observed his fellow inmates and analyzed their difficulties. After three years at the Bloomingdale Hospital, Dr. Brown was a member of the free world once more. He carried with him a message of hope and encouragement from the most hopeless of all worlds, the world of the insane. He delivered lectures and gave verbal encouragement to hundreds who were in danger of losing their minds. At the age of seventy-five, his book A Mind Mislaid was published, a book particularly helpful to those subject to nervous breakdown, for in it are constructive truths that he learned at the doors of self-destruction: No matter how hard it is, one must forget, and once having forgotten, it is not hard to forgive. There is absolutely no virtue in repining; there is positive harm and real danger in thinking back to what might have been. The gentle gospel of the Master of "Beginning Again" contains all the essentials of joyful, successful living, and his words about faith, repentance, and forgiveness peace, and brotherly love are not platitudes, as we sometimes regard them, but hard and fast rules by which men must live, or come to the grief of war, failure, self-destruction, and even the destruction of others. Despair and discouragement are the tools of evil, and they are too much at hand in the darkest hour. April, with its returning life, holding, as it does, the resurrection of the Savior, is truly an especial time for new beginnings. It is the bright morning after the dark night of winter..
