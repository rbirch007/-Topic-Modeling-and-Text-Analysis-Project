Woman's Sphere = Ramona W. Cannon ITH famine, disease, and injustice still stalking the world, we are confronted at every turn with sharp reminders of that second great commandment of Jesus to love. One's neighbor as oneself. The people of America have done a valiant work in relieving suffering; but must we not come yet closer to the literal following of the Savior's pattern for living? RS. ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, our country's one woman delegate to the United Nations Organization conference in London, said, after traveling in Germany, that if people wanted to know the reason for the UNO, they should have a look at conditions in Germany. NORA WALN, Atlantic Monthly correspondent in the American zone in Germany, writes that out of 2866 births in August, 1148 deaths occurred, the principal cause being lack of food for mothers or babies. ANY young people in France have only half the daily amount of calories considered essential to health. A reputable French doctor believes that ninety-five per cent of the young people of Paris have tuberculosis. The French infant mortality rate is thirty-three per cent. The Chinese, East Indians, Malayans, and Filipinos have suffered excessively and still hunger. In India, in 1943, three million died of starvation. The present famine there is expected to be even worse. UTAH, since becoming a state in 1896, has had eight governors, including the present executive. The wives of four ex-Governors are still living. A fifth, Mrs. Charles R. Mabey, is only recently deceased. The surviving ladies, all widows, are: the State's first first-lady, Mrs. Heber M. Wells (1896-1904); Mrs. William Spry (1909-1917); Mrs. George H. Dern (1925-1933); Mrs. Henry Blood (1933-1941). S a small Indian girl, Rose Daniels, now ninety-one years old, was captured from her Navajo tribe by the Utes. As was done in many cases, the Mormons purchased her freedom. Living among her rescuers, she learned their ways. Later, married to a Ute and living on the barren reservation, she planted as the Mormons did, devising an irrigation system from the ditches, and improving her strains by working with the best seed. She has developed the only Lima bean that can be grown in the short, dry seasons of Utah, Wyoming, and South Dakota. Page 249 VOL. 33 EDITORIAL APRIL 1946
