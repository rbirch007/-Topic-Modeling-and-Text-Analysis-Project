Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, April 1, and April 15, 1886 For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS TOOELE: The quarterly conference of the Relief Society was held in the Tooele meeting house, March 13 and 14, 1886, with M. A. Hunter presiding. After the usual opening exercises, President Hunter made a few opening remarks, during which Sisters Presendia Kimball and Helen Mar Whitney arrived from Salt Lake City. Sister Kimball was the first speaker. She gave a great deal of good counsel and advice, suitable to all the saints, both old and young. Sister Whitney spoke very interestingly, with remarks to suit all, and encouraged all to live up to their privileges, for we live in very critical times. ****Sisters Kimball and Whitney stopped all the week and visited and cheered the sisters for they were full of blessings, and on Saturday returned home to the city.  Ann Tate, Cor. Sec. For Tooele Stake.  PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT: There is almost no limit to the physical development and health that may be gained and maintained by walking that is done for the purpose of exercise. Any one can find time and space in which to walk, and one can find congenial company for such trips. A prospective husband is not the best company at such times, for with him the walk will almost inevitably degenerate into a saunter; further, no woman can walk freely when custom or affection compels her to lean upon a masculine arm. To be beneficial, walking must be done in shoes broad enough to let the feet be placed firmly upon the ground at every step, and in clothing which will allow free play to the lungs and arms. The step should be as quick as can be maintained without causing uncomfortable increase in the action of the heart. The pedestrian should breathe through the nose, carry the head erect, and not be afraid of being high shouldered.  Selected see NOTES AND NEWS: The criterion of true beauty is that it increases on examination; if false, that it lessens. There is something, therefore, in true beauty that corresponds with right reason, and is not merely the creation of fancy.  Lord Greenville eek x MISCELLANEOUS: Silence does not always mark wisdom. The hardest useful labor is less exhausting, in the long run, than exciting pleasures, as most of their devotees in middle life sadly confess. Truth is as impossible to be soiled by any outward touch as the sunbeam. Then raise up your voices, fair daughters of Zion, Stand forth in the pride of your honor and worth; There's a power above us, whose hand we rely on, More potent than princes and kings of the earth.
