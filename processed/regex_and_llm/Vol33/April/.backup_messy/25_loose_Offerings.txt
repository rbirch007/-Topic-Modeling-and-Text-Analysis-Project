OFFERINGS Etta S. Robbins Thanks from our hearts we give For blessings small and great, For homes and ties that bind In this estate. For liberty, we still maintain  That heritage sublime; For faith in him of Calvary, Our Lord divine. O Thou, who freely ministers, Supplying all our needs, Accept the offerings we bring words and deeds. Ke
