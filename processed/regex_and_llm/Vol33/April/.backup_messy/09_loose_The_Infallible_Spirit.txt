The Infallible Spirit Etta Mai Scott "Help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee" (II Chronicles 14:11). WHEN this statement was made, Asa saw himself confronted by a vast army, steeds, and chariots, with no sign of any reinforcements to come to his relief. Holding his own in the face of all of this, was a feat he felt that he could not attain. Therefore, he turned to the Lord and made entreaty. Asa's problem was only the case of the normal human being confronted with tragedy. We rush out to battle with our fears, and just as long as we have them under control, or as long as we are sure we have reinforcements to back us up, we move along at a gallant pace. But just let the walls of sorrow, grief, or despair confront us, let the wall of friendship, with which we thought ourselves surrounded, crumble, and our fortunes disappear, and we find ourselves lost and dazed. Then it is that we, like Asa, turn our eyes toward God that great infallible Father to whom a flood of prayers is constantly ascending, that great Power whose word can stay the waves, move mountains, and calm the troubled souls of men. If only we would keep our eyes fixed upon him all the time instead of calling in our hour of distress: "Help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee." Page 237
