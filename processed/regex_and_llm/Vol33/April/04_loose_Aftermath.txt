aftermath of war, I can find peace when I read the sacred word. I can keep that peace as a wall of strength about my vulnerable soul, only as I remember, only as I live by those words. I am weak. The winds of confusion, of fear, of pestilence, of death; blow hot upon my citadel. They 'scorch my defenses. They roar with terror in my ears. I must return Page 226 again and again, and yet again, to the well which is never dry. I must drink cooling draughts from it, else I cannot bear the heat of this perplexing day. Over and over I must remind myself, as King David did long years ago, that "the Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." There is solace in this song because it rings with an answering echo from the spoken words of the Man of Galilee whose sojourn among men, though brief, can never be forgotten. His lips spoke gentle comfort to all men everywhere. His words were meek and kind and understanding. His life was lived to fulfill his Father's will and was offered on the cross because of his great love for you and me. Think upon him for a moment, how he lived only to give the world one great message, the simple story of love, love of God and love of all men. The world listened. The world remembered. But the world has never wholly heeded the precept. Yet the memory of this Man has endured and will always endure as long as there are souls who love truth and freedom as long as there are yet those who will read his words. Sit in the quiet of your room. Shut yourself in with the quiet precepts of this Jesus of Nazareth. Or, if your world has been blacked out, if all is dark around you, if your eyes have for the moment lost their vision, or if your Book is not at hand, let your heart repeat the ECHOES OF HOPE Christian's universal creed: "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." You know the words. Let them peal with the solemnity of sweet-toned bells, and before the sound of each line shall have died away, like an echo, you can hear the words of the Son of God, speaking again, as he did so long ago, words of assurance, words of hope, words of peace. Listen! You can hear them even now. THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD; I SHALL NOT WANT. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But. He that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.... My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand (John 10: 11-15; 27-29). HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES: I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture (John 10:9). HE LEADETH ME BESIDE THE STILL WATERS. Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life (John 4:13-14). HE RESTORETH MY SOUL: I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live (John 11:25). HE LEADETH ME IN PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.... For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works (Matthew 16:24-27). YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL: FOR THOU ART WITH ME; THY ROD AND THY STAFF THEY COM.- FORT ME. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom (Luke 12:32). Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows (Matthew 10: 29-31). And, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world (Matthew 28:20). THOU PREPAREST A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MINE ENEMIES: THOU ANOINTEST MY HEAD WITH OIL; MY CUP RUNNETH OVER. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you (John 15:18-19). SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE: AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER. 228 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also (John 14:2-3). And then, like a benediction, I think I hear him praying, as he did when his life was so near its end, praying for you and for me. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.... I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from evil.. O nghteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them (John 17: 11, 15, 25, 26). O hear, all ye people! Hear and remember the words of the Man who has redeemed you with his blood. Hear and understand the message in this greatest Book of books. Hear, not alone with the ears, but with the mind, the heart, the soul. Hear and be comforted! Hear and be strong! Hear the words that speak of life eternal, the words that tell of hope, glorious and tnumphant, of love, deep and everlasting. Hear and know! When there is hope for the future, there is strength for today!
