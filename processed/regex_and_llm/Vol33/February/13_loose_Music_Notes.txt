Music Notes Dr. Florence J. Madsen Member Relief Society General Board "We can impart to others only that which we know." THE truthfulness of this statement comes  sooner or later to all of us who try to serve in the organizations of our Church. Just as soon as we are required to give from our meager store of knowledge, we realize that if the giving is to continue for long, we must find ways and means to replenish the storehouse. Fortunately, through the printed page, there have been preserved for us the finest thoughts and ideas of the greatest men and women throughout the ages. Whatever the chosen subject, there is printed material in abundance to cover any phase of that subject. Those who are called to take over the music of any of the auxiliaries of the Church should have access to some standard music textbooks. The Relief Society library of each ward should have in it three books on music which are at all times available to the chorister and to the accompanist. These books are: a music dictionary, a book on the fundamentals of music, and a book on conducting. The conductor and the accompanist should always work together in perfect harmony. Each should give and take to better the cause. All problems should be solved before new music is presented to the singers. Rhythm patterns should be rehearsed sufficiently so that they are not merely attached but are a very part of oneself. Foreign words indicating tempo or speed of the rhythm should be pronounced correctly and defined accurately. All expression marks or signs should be understood and adhered to. The aim should always be to understand all things that appear on the printed page of music and to impart this knowledge to the singing group. Those who are learning to conduct will find it most helpful to practice before a large mirror where they can see their motions and bodily posture. All conductors should use a baton as it is much easier to follow and understand than the varying gestures of the hand. The accompanists should be thoroughly familiar with all the. Accompaniments of songs to be rehearsed or sung. They should be able, at any time, to leave the accompaniment and give help to any part or parts that need help. This often requires that the accompanist read from three different staves simultaneously. This is rather a difficult thing to do and requires considerable practice. A great musician said: The conductor of a singing group may be quite ordinary, but with the help of a fine accompanist, can do extraordinary work, while, on the contrary, the fine conductor et a poor accompanist can accomplish little. MUSIC NOTES The singing group can progress to no greater heights than the leadership can take it. We never reach perfection, but we are ever on its trail. Joy comes with every new thing learned and shared with others, so we should avail ourselves of any opportunity to improve our talents. Note: The General Board recommends that each ward Relief Society purchase three of the five books listed below and keep them available for reference. It is suggested that these books be carefully preserved in order that they may be used from year to year, and that someone be held responsible for them. 127 Suggested References: CORNWALL, SPENCER, Fundamentals of Conducting....................$.50 Etson, Louis Charles, Pocket Music Dictionary Paper COVER..........$..50 Cloth cover .........-$1.75 GEHRKENS, Kart Witson, Essentials in Conducting................----$1.75 GEHRKENS, Kari Wison, The Fundamentals of Music............$1.50 SMITH, Leo, Musical Rudiments $1.00 These books are available at the Deseret Book Company, 44 East South Temple Street, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. A PRAYER Celia Van Cott Lord, we give thanks? The sword is sheathed; the bullets cease, Across the earth we hope for peace; White doves are loosed to fly Unmolested through the sky.

Cleanse hearts of hate, O Lord, with your giving, Touch eyes gone blind; teach us Christ's way of living. DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 16?The Building of Temples Continues Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday May 7, 1946 Objective: To show that God provides for the fulfillment of all his purposes. AMONG the many glorious things that came to Joseph Smith on the night of September 21, 1823, were the words concerning the coming of Elijah. There in the celestial brightness of his humble room, this young American Prophet received wisdom from the heavenly messenger, Moroni. Joseph wrote of the event as follows: After telling me these things, he commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament. He first quoted part of the third chapter of Malachi; and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy, though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bible. Instead of quoting the first verse as it reads in our books, he quoted it thus: For behold, the day cometh that shall bum as an oven, and all the proud, yea, all that do wickedly shall burn as stubble; for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. And again, he quoted the fifth verse thus: Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Page 128 He also quoted the next verse differently: And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming. In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament. He said that that prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet come when "they who would not hear his voice should be cut off from among the people," but soon would come. He also quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth verse to the last. He also said that this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be. And he further stated that the fulness of the Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of scripture, and offered many explanations which cannot be mentioned here (Joseph Smith, 2:36-41). Today, some one hundred and twenty odd years since that evening in the early fall of 1823 on the Palmyra farm, a great Church with followers throughout the world, has LESSON DEPARTMENT come to know the mighty mission of Elijah and the explanations of his work which then the Prophet said could not be mentioned. It has been within the sacred temples of the Lord built by the Latter-day Saints within this century that much of the work of turning the hearts of the children to their fathers and the hearts of the fathers to their children has taken place. The Lord knew that giving men their free agency would, of necessity, bring waywardness and heartaches. But he was willing to suffer these things to be, since he also knew that the greatest joy comes through the personal struggle to conquer self and sin; that salvation is not something that comes suddenly, but rather it is that process of day-by-day living that teaches us the folly of our weaker ways and the blessings of our stronger moments. We must learn to know?through firsthand experience?why the Lord's way is always the right way. Then, when living has made this truth ours, we will love him the more dearly because of his infinite patience and understanding. There, too, will come the joy of seeing others dear to us rise in the majesty of self-control. The great mercy of our Heavenly Father provides in such a plan for life the encompassing of man's preexistent, mortal, and post-mortal years. Further, the Lord's plan provides that a place be established where links between the earth and the heavens may be bound, a place in the world where men as well as heavenly beings may find communion. Such a place is in the temples of the Most High. And since there are ordinances to be performed and endowments to be received here on 129 earth, the binding effect of which is to be realized both in this world and in the world to come, again the reason is apparent why such a place of meeting should be. With the coming of the dispensation of the fulness of times which the Prophet Joseph Smith was called to usher in, the Lord had said that the fulness of the Gentiles was at hand. Now he would bring about the fulfilment of prophecies pertaining to the last days and hasten the work of redemption of the faithful both for those upon the earth and those who had gone beyond. His word should be preached in the spirit world as well as to men here and, by means of his temples which should steadily be built until they would dot the earth, all the righteous could become his people. By the thousands, then, men and women in the flesh could become saviors on Mount Zion (Rev. 14:1) by helping to redeem their dead and bring about the great family of elect in Israel. So important was to be this work that the gathering of names of dear ones long since gone would become a major assignment of those living, that, by proxy, the steps not completed for entrance into the kingdom through the waters of baptism might be performed. The Christ was indeed to draw all men who would come unto his bosom. Greatly aware of the need for this work and the weight of responsibility which rested upon him, the Prophet Joseph Smith soon made clear to his gathering saints that they must sacrifice to obtain the blessings of heaven. And so within six years after the organization of the Church, there stood up- on the rich soil of Ohio the first house of the Lord in this dispensation erected by the saints at a cost of inestimable sacrifice. This simple but solid and stately temple was set upon a hill and lifted its spire above the majestic trees of Kirtland. Writes Edward W. Tullidge:... It was commenced in June, 1833, under immediate direction of the Almighty, through his servant, Joseph Smith, whom he called in his boyhood, like Samuel of old, to introduce the fulness of the everlasting gospel. At that time the saints were few in number, and most of them very poor; and had it not been for the assurance that God had spoken, and had commanded that a house should be built to his name, of which he not only revealed the form but also designated the dimensions, an attempt towards building that Temple, under the then existing circumstances, would have been, by all concerned, pronounced preposterous... Its dimensions are eighty by fifty-nine feet; the walls fifty feet high, and the tower one hundred and ten feet. The two main halls are fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the inner court. The building has four vestries in front and five rooms in the attic, which were devoted to literature and for meetings of the various quorums of the priesthood. There was a peculiarity in the arrangement of the inner court which made it more than ordinarily impressive?so much so that a sense of sacred awe seemed to test upon all who entered. Not only the Saints, but strangers also, manifested a high degree of reverential feeling. Four pulpits stood, one above another, in the center of the building, from north to south, both on the east and west ends.... In front of each of these two rows of pulpits was a sacrament table, for the administration of that sacred ordinance. In each comer of the court was an elevated pew for the singers?the choir being distributed into four compartments. In addition to the pulpit-curtains were others, intersecting at right angles, which divided the main ground-floor hall into four equal sections, giving to each one-half of one set of pulpits From the day the ground was broken for laying the foundation of the Temple, until its dedication on the 27th of March, 1836, the work was vigorously prosecuted. With very little capital except brain, bone, and sinew, combined with unwavering trust in God, men, women, and even children, worked with their might. While the brethren labored in their departments, the sisters were actively engaged in boarding and clothing workmen not otherwise provided for?all living as abstemiously as possible so that every cent might be appropriated to the grand object, while their energies were stimulated by the prospect of participating in the blessing of the house built by the direction of the Most High, and accepted by him. ?TULLIDGE, E. W., Life of Joseph, the Prophet, pp. 187-189; See Lundwall, N. B., Temples of the Most High, pp. 7-11. One week following the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, it being the Sabbath, April 3, 1836, Joseph Smith the Prophet and Oliver Cowdery had retired to the pulpit, the veils being dropped. They bowed in solemn prayer. As they arose a marvelous vision was opened to both of them (See Doc. And Cov. 110). How glorious had been the fulfillment of the words of the Angel Moroni! Since this day of the coming of the Lord to his temple, the saints have gone on, at times under the most trying circumstances, to build other houses to the Lord, and within these have found the soul-enriching experiences promised those who would go about the work of salvation for their dead. As the work of the Lord progresses, the great temple to be erected in Missouri will one day be a reality, the corner stones of which were laid August 3, 1831. Pointing to that day and in preparation for it there have been built upon the earth the following temples erected by a people devoted to the King of heaven and the fulfillment of his excellent word. The Genealogical Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was established in 1894 as the Genealogical Society of Utah, to forward the vital program of the Church in the matter of temple work for the living and dead, was reincorporated for one hundred years on November 20, 1944, and its name changed as given above In addition to the many services offered to members of the Church in assisting them to do temple work for the living and dead, the Genealogical Society also maintains a library for g enealogical research which includes at the present time over 30,000 printed volumes and over 4,000 volumes of microfilm records (including over one million pages of original records from North Carolina and three-quarters of a million pages from Tennessee). It has the largest foreign section of any genealogical library in America and includes many unique collections among which is a copy of Boyd's Marriage Index containing the names of six million Persons who Married in England..  LESSON DEPARTMENT  The only other copy of this Marriage Index is in London, England.

To understand more fully the things of God and the great blessings given in his temples one might well begin by learn. 46:10-33 with the notes following found in the Commentary 2. Within the temples of the Most High the saints are drawn closer to the world beyond. How can one here in life learn to know the true from the false spirit in Preparation for the finer things of the Lord? Read Doc. And Coy. 50. The supreme joys to be found in the temples of the Lord cannot truly be discussed, they are to be lived in sacred places. It is hoped, therefore, that this second series on Church history has in some way awakened a desire for those who have studied to make themselves worthy of the Lord's greatest blessings to be given in his holy temples. For pictures of Latter-day Saint temples see A Relief Society Century, page 64. Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 8?Charity Never Faileth Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, May 7, 1946 Objective: To encourage people to put their trust in charity as the unfailing means of improving themselves and of influencing others for good. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophecy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.... For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity (I Cor. 13:8 ff). Paul wrote these words to the Corinthian saints because they were disputing among themselves about the relative importance of certain spiritual gifts. Some saints were making a show of the gift of tongues ?causing confusion, envy, and strife in their meetings. Paul did not intend to minimize the value of prophecy, the gift of tongues, and knowledge, but he knew that the things we know in part shall "be done away" with when a fulness of knowledge comes. He asked only that the Corinthian saints entertain a proper sense of values and cease having disputations concerning divine gifts. Love is at the heart of the gospel of Christ. The development of love and of the other great attributes of Deity in the lives of individuals and in society is the chief aim of the gospel. Prophecy, knowledge, and spiritual gifts inspired of Deity will always contribute towards this purpose. The passing of time has not changed the value of Paul's emphasis on charity or love. Love is still the first commandment and the end of our religious striving. Other things in life, not in harmony with love, shall pass away. Knowledge alone, for example, will not bring us peace; knowledge alone will not enable us to rear our children in paths of righteousness; prophecies, the gift of tongues, a theoretical knowledge of the gospel alone will not guarantee us a happy and successful life together in the Church or in the world. All of these things, to be of value, must be accompanied by the spirit of love. It is growth in love and good will based on gospel-living which will endure and never fail us. Paul's counsel to the Corinthians applies with equal force to us today. Let a husband and wife make decisions with charity as well as with knowledge, for their decisions will pass but their love will endure. Let a mother counsel her children with love as well as with knowledge, for a proud youth may not heed his mother's words but he will not forget her  love. Let the worker in the Church Or a tinkling cymbal," Let us put labor with the love of Christ lest his our faith in love and never neglect Words "become as Sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.? Let us put our faith in love and never neglect it. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 8-Bible Influence as Revealed in Children?s Literature D. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, May 21, 1946 LITERATURE for children had its beginning in folk lore. Out of the wealth of stories created in the long-ago for fireside entertainment and to impress life lessons have come many stories of appeal for both young and old. Youth enjoys the story; age gets more of the inner meaning from it. In this time tested literature is a rich heritage for all.
Among these treasures are Aesop's fables?a collection of little tales, mainly of Greek origin, each carrying its moral. Legend has woven some interesting stories about Aesop. He is said to have been a pedagogue or teacher, full of quaint wit and wisdom. Certain it is that the tales credited to him preserve in living form some helpful maxims; for example:
THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF
A young shepherd tending his flock on a hillside not far from a village, decided to have some sport; he suddenly cried, "Wolf, Wolf!"
Immediately there was a scurrying of the men from town up the hills to help tend his sheep. But when they came puffing up to where he was, they found him laughing at his trick.
Next day he tried the same foolish trick. Again the men came by his help, and again they were laughed at by the silly shepherd. On the third day, a wolf really did come. The boy shouted and shouted but no one walked up his help. Some of the flock were killed before the men, in the tow. A liar is not believed even when he does tell the truth.
Action centered in a simple but interesting plot, with appropriate conversation to add life, makes these fables of Aesop rare stories. Added to this they impress practical life lessons. Each class member will recall some of the good old fables that Aesop, or someone else, has bequeathed to us. These stories are not linked with the Bible, but they are in keeping with its helpful teachings.
Legends are another type of stories which not only charm but often teach. One the writer has carried in pleasant memory for years is that of Androcles and the Lion. It tells a tale of a Greek slave who was saved by a lion from whose wounded foot he had extracted a large, painful thorn.
 LESSON DEPARTMENT 133 Later, Androclus, captured by the Romans and trained as a gladiator, met the same lion in the arena. The beast bounded forward to attack, but stopped. It would not fight its friend. The Emperor, learning the reason, ordered both Androclus and the lion freed. This is just a legend?blending some historical facts with fancy? but it impresses the value of kindness to animals. The story of Damon and Pythias is another legend portraying loyal friendship. Many similar stories have been passed down to us. Like Aesop's fables, they were created before Christianity came to the Greeks, but many of them are in consonance with the Christian spirit. Another type of story created and preserved by the common folk is the fairy tale. To the Grimm Brothers ?early day students of language and folklore?we are indebted for a wealth of these and other folk stories. Created for fireside entertainment and told and retold down the years, many of these old stories have not only rhythmic charm but everyday goodness. Each will recall a favorite among these tales. One that has literally gone round the world is Cinderella. A story basically like it has been found even among the Indians, but instead of dainty glass slippers, the little red heroine wore beautifully beaded moccasins; and the hero, of course, was a fine young chieftain. Folk think of the Cinderella story as purely fanciful. It is all that and far more. It is true to life and true to truth. At heart its lesson is: Real worth will one day come into its own. An interesting thing about these old folk tales is the spirit of democracy that they radiate. Cinderella, the faithful little kitchen maid, wins the prince. In Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, recreated recently in a colorful photoplay by Walt Disney, we have the same intermingling of folk of high and low degree. Those characters possessing home virtues always win in the best of the fairy tales preserved by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. Mother Goose, of course, must not be forgotten. Where this quaint old creature came from, with her jingles and her interesting folk of every type, no one surely knows. Some like to think she was a real person, but that seems not true. Nursery thymes that are linked with the name are probably just creations of the common people, mainly, of old England. No matter what the source of nursery thymes, they have fascinated children through the years. They are the first literature of tiny tots; they charm grandparents, too, or others who take time to share their music and fun with the lively boys and girls. Wholesome humor and entertainment sparkle in the best of the Mother Goose rhymes. They hold a wealth of human nature, too. This heritage of time-tested literature provides not merely recreation, but a basis of understanding and appreciation for all literature. No finer examples of storytelling can be found than in the folk tales. Having been passed in oral form along the stream of time, they are like the water-tumbled stones, rounded and polished. To survive folk criticism, the story had to have appeal for common people.  LESSON DEPARTMENT This is why homely virtues win praise; and good triumphs over evil in these classic tales. They offer a standard measurement with which to judge more modern creations. Further, because they have been woven into many of the more recent stones for old and young through language, allusions, and characters, it becomes doubly necessary that children and grownups get closer to this literary heritage. Best of all the story treasures from long ago are those from the Bible. Children, under the guidance of their parents, should grow up with these. Beginning with the ones that deal with childhood and youth as "Abraham and Isaac," "Joseph and His Brothers," "The Boy Samuel," "David, the Young Shepherd," the "Story of the Christ Child," boys and girls can be led into a love of the Book of Books. No better practice than that of reading aloud in the home choice selections from the Bible can be recommended. This applies both from the viewpoint of implanting a love of gospel truth, and cultivating literary appreciation; for the Bible as we have it in the King James translation, is superb English literature. This may be plainly seen when its stories are properly voiced. Excellent books to help foster such appreciation are Hulbert's Story of the Bible for Young and Old and The Illustrated Bible Story Book by Seymour Loveland. Attractive 'other books portraying the Bible for young folk are also available. Of course the Bible itself is always a first reference. Literature created especially for children did not make its appearance to any great extent before about the middle of the nineteenth century. 135  What the little folk were given before that time was what might be called family literature?stories young and old might enjoy. One of the fireside favorites, along with Bible stories, was Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan. In her Little Women, Louisa M. Alcott pictures the joy she and her sisters had in following Christian, the hero of this allegory, in his soul-testing adventures on the way to the "Delectable Mountains." Robinson Crusoe, by Daniel Defoe, and Gulliver's Travels, by Jonathan Swift, are other adventure stories widely enjoyed round the hearth-sides of earlier days, except those of severely Puritan cast, where fiction was strictly ruled out. What these folk wanted for themselves and their children was the Bible. To train their young folk in the reading of the scriptures, they established their schools. An easy step to this end was provided in the New England Primer, which begins with this couplet: In Adam's fall We sinned all. School readers created later varied the strictly Biblical offerings somewhat, yet they kept a strongly religious tone. Even the famed McGuffey Readers, first published in 1879, keep close to the Bible in spirit and content. Love of God, love of nature, of home and friends, respect for parents, kindliness, charity, honesty and the other Christian virtues are all impressed with a choice selection of stories, poems, and other literature in the McGuffey Readers. "Rather old-fashioned," someone may remark, Yes, but in tribute to his great contribution to character building, American leaders ?Henry Ford among them?not so long ago joined in honoring the memory of James McGuffey, creator of the pioneer texts which bear his name. With the rise of the common schools came an increase in literature designed especially for children. Stories and poems for the young began to appear. Authors turned their talents more towards the creation of literature of appeal for little folk, and for youth. A few of them won literary fame through such creations. Among the first thus to rise was Hans Christian Andersen, of Denmark. His delightful stories, for children of all ages, spread beyond his native land to become a treasured possession?the best of them? of children everywhere. Some of these tales are, like those of the Grimm Brothers, just old folk stories preserved with Andersen's artistry. Others are of his own creation. In The Ugly Duckling we are given, so many think, a life picture of the author himself, as he was transformed from a boyhood of poverty and struggle to the life of a graceful writer, like the swan, admired by all. It is a story beloved by children everywhere for its sweetness of spirit and happy outcome. Five Peas in a Pod is another of Andersen's created tales that tells of God's gift of a little flower to bring health and happiness to a humble home. In our own country and England, a number of talented writers have bequeathed to young folk a wealth of choice literature. Any list of these authors would not, of course, represent the favorites of all our youth or their parents. Tastes and reading opportunities vary. Certain authors, however, will have place in practically every well-chosen selection of stories for the young?and this because what they create is interesting, artistic, wholesome. Their books can be safely read round any home fireside. A story of how one family built up a choice library may be helpful here. Inspired by the mother who read choice literature aloud to her children for evening recreation, the boys and girls of this family decided to help her enrich the home library. Their plan was simple. Carefully selected books were to be given as birthday and Christmas presents for several years. With the help of teachers and the mother, the books were chosen. As a result of this concerted effort new volumes began to brighten the o]d bookcase. Among them were the following: Little Women and Old Fashioned Girl by Louisa May Alcott; The Prince and the Pauper and Tom Sawyer by Mark 'Twain, Bird's Christmas Carol, and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm by Kate Douglas Wiggin; Helen's Babies by John Habberton; Adventures in Friend: ship by David Grayson; Hoosier School Boy by Edward Eggleston; Birds, Bees and Other Studies in Nature, by John Burroughs; Wild Animals I Have Known by Emest Thompson Seton; Boy's Life of Lincoln, by Helen Nicolay; Story of My Life by Helen Keller, A Watcher in the Woods by Dallas Lore Sharp; Wonder Book and Tanglewood Tales by Nathaniel Hawthorne; Sketch Book by Washington Irving; The Crisis by Winston Churchill; Boy Life on the Prairie by Hamlin Garland; Captain Courageous and The Jungle Books by Rudyard Kipling; The Honorable Peter Stirling by Paul Ford; Hero  LESSON DEPARTMENT Tales from American History by Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge. Added to these were poems by Riley, by Stevenson, by Eugene Field; and a collection of readings in prose and verse under the title of One Hundred Choice Selections. Best of all, the library was enjoyed; it was the center of the home. Not only the family, but many of the neighbors came informally to enjoy the sharing of its riches, especially when there was a story-sharing hour or an evening with the poets. Observe that there was a rich variety in the selection of books for that home library. All need a wholesome, varied diet for mind and spirit as well as for the body. One division that would seem to be lacking in this collection is books for little folk; but remember, it was boys and girls in their early adolescent years who helped build up the library here referred to. Had there been little ones among them, the list would doubtless have included Little Black Sambo by Helen Bannerman; Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter; Pinocchio by Collody; Heidi by Spyri; Mother Goose Village by Madge Bingham; Nursery Rhymes selected by Charles Welsh, or the richly illustrated Denslow's Mother Goose; and surely, if the choice were made now, Bambi by Felix Salton would not be forgotten. Neither would Little House in the Big Woods, and Little House on the Prairie, etc., by Laura Ingalls Wilder be omitted from the home library. Children's literature in these days is coming off the press in rapidly increasing quantity. "Of the making books," to quote scripture, "there is no end." Most of these created, 137 however, ate butterfly-like, showy, and just for a season. What ones will live and last only time can tell. Some are cleverly written; too few seem to possess classic qualities which give continuing joy. We need literature for entertainment, of course. It is only that which is read and reread, however, that brings recreation, uplift, wisdom. Our people should not only seek out choice literature for children from what has been and is being created; but also should encourage the creation by our own authors of children's literature of lasting quality. Great literature, we should remember, is lived before it is written. Out of the courageous living of the Latter-day Saints of more than a hundred years, materials of rarest quality have been made for great literature for young and old. The spirit of true authorship should be more assiduously cultivated. More attention should be given to studying and developing artistry of expression? not sophisticated style?but that which rings true, which is simple, concrete, Bible-inspired. Another vital need is more voicing of beautiful literature in our homes. 'There is no academy on earth," says Horace E. Scudder, "equal to a mother's reading to her child." Further, there is for all mothers the equivalent of a good many college courses in an earnest study of children's literature. 'There is joy also in cultivating a love of literature in children and guiding wisely their book companionship, in helping them tactfully to find for themselves the real gold. And now, may the writer pay loving tribute to his own mother. Whatever love and appreciation he has for literature has come primarily because she inspired it during his boyhood by voicing beautifully choice literature in the home. It is a precious memory. A reader sent me a short verse by Strickland Gillilan called "Wealth." I hope it impresses you as it did me. You may have tangible wealth untold, Caskets of jewels and coffers of gold. Richer than I, you never can be? I had a mother who read to me. Discussion and Activities 1, a?What is a story you have treasured from childhood?

Suggestions to Literature Class Leaders The following practical suggestions for teachers of the literature course have been sent to the General Board by the author of the 1945- 1946 literature lessons, Brother Howard R. Driggs. During his extensive traveling he has talked with many Relief Society class leaders. As a result of these conversations he has prepared the following suggestions: First: My advice to you teachers is?Study the Discussion Questions First. See whether, without reading the lesson, you can answer some of these questions in part or completely. Whether you can or not, you will be better prepared to _ study the lesson proper. You will also be better prepared to gather additional materials to enrich it. Second: Do not look too far afield for helpful materials. First of all, these lessons call for a better working knowledge of the Bible. They will serve as a review and give a new view of many of the well-known stories and other parts of that great book. Another thing: The lessons are so planned that most of the literature needed to make them come to life can be easily obtained from books in the home library, from literary texts that are being used by children in grades or in high school, and certainly, in the public library where such libraries are available.  LESSON DEPARTMENT I am making these suggestions because I feel that, first of all, teachers and class members are not appreciating the study questions and suggestions that follow the lessons. These have been worked out with great care and with the general membership of your organization in clear 139 view. They point the way towards fruitful activity that will help make the course alive and interesting. By considering these discussion questions and topics first, teachers will be helped to get away from the lecture method. One way to do this, even more effectively, is to let members of the class be assigned to lead in discussing the various questions. This will bring them to the class prepared for action. Social Science Modern Applications of Moral Principles Lesson 14?Morality and the Church Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, May 28, 1946 Lesson link: Last month we applied principles of social ethics to the problem of economic inequality, racketeering, political corruption, and war. It was shown that justice is often violated in the modern world, and that real peace and happiness can never come until man learns how to be fair, equable, and charitable toward his fellowmen. Lesson aim: To examine religion as a moral force in life. Ig was Jesus who said, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled" (Matthew 5:6); and Nephi makes this more clear (III Nephi 12:6). Religion supplies an urge to righteousness, a motive for morals. Just as the family is the seedbed of character so is the church the climate under which it can best develop. Religion views righteousness against the background of eternal life, and by helping people to see mote clearly and feel more deeply it supplies the spiritual lift so necessary in times of temptation and moral crisis. Soul Erosion There is considerable talk these days about the waste of natural resources, about the problem of soil erosion and the necessity for conservation. All of this is well and good. But an even more serious problem, and one that is receiving too little attention, is the problem of soul erosion and the importance of conservation in the field of human resources. What good is material wealth if it is used for dissipation and destruction? What good is technological advancement if it fails to bring peace and happiness to a world that is tired and sick from centuries of sin? Scientific learning and material progress are of little value if they leave man in misery; it is socially, spiritually, and morally that we lag. With war come many frightful things, including the publication of long lists of casualties. But there are other casualty lists, more serious even than these, which go unpublished. 'These are the lists of the countless numbers who become calloused to suffering and hardened to sin; of those who give up to temptation, who let down their standards, and who start downhill. It is better to lose a life than to lose a soul. Ethical progress, and the happiness it insures, depend much more upon the method of living than upon life alone; much more upon right than upon might; much more upon morals than upon money. There are only three possible approaches to truth: (1) the approach of the scientist through observation, investigation, and analysis; (2) the approach of the philosopher through meditation, speculation, and logic; and (3) the approach of the religionist through inspiration, revelation, and faith. Most of us rely somewhat upon all three of these sources, leaning more heavily upon one or the other according to individual taste. But some people exclude religion entirely, claiming that it is based upon weakness and naivety and that it leads to superstition rather than truth. These people are mistaken, as the testimony of millions has and will bear witness. The genuine religious experience goes much beyond the sensory experience of the scientist or the rational experience of the philosopher; and those who fail to reach it, fail to really live. But there are those who fail to reach the heights of religious expression; who are content to remain in the world of physical reality alone, skeptical of everything that may lie beyond. And this is one reason for man's inhumanity to man. There is too much materialism and too little spirituality among men today; too much worldliness and too little godliness; too many hedonists and too few moralists. On the Fringe of Righteousness Many who profess religious belief fail to demonstrate it in their conduct. With many, religion is a mere verbalism, or at best a mannerism, but certainly not a way of life. Sometimes institutional religion fails to mesh with society and to vitalize the lives of its people. Sometimes religion doesn't "carry-over." Sometimes people are content to remain on the fringe of righteousness, going through the motions but missing the spirit and the substance of the thing. A few of the ways in which this is done are listed below: (1) Escapism. This is sometimes spoken of as otherworldliness. 'The tendency is to run away from life and to find refuge in the hope of another and better world. This is all right if it isn't carried too far. The church should provide a haven for the oppressed and an incentive for eternal living, but where people become too obsessed and preoccupied with the afterlife they often fail to live properly as they go along. 'They overindulge in wishful thinking, living in a dream world, failing to be realistic.  LESSON DEPARTMENT (2) Opportunism. This is the tendency on the part of many to turn religion to their own temporal advantage, to use church membership as an opportunity for private profit. Salesmen will intentionally make contacts at church services that they hope to capitalize on later in the year; merchants will purposely build up good will in church so as to increase business; politicians will attend church and become affable in manner in order to get in the public eye and build up their vote-getting strength; et cetera. This might even be called "business religion," for those who practice it turn their worship into a mere business. (3) Conspicuous performance. Here we have the practice of religious activity for the sake of showing off. There are those who like to be socially conspicuous and are willing to use the church services for this purpose only, or mainly. The overplay on fine clothes, the arrogant snobbery so prevalent in some churches, the tendency on the part of a few to monopolize class discussions and to even seek church positions; all of these are examples. Conspicuous performance in church programs is immoral because it distorts true religion and makes of it a mere technique for social intercourse and selfish display. (4) Hypocrisy. The opportunists and the conspicuous performers are also hypocrites, but there are other varieties as well. Whenever preachments fail to square fundamentally with practice, or Sunday manners do not conform to week-day performances, the person is a hypocrite, for he seeks to deceive. 141 Piety alone is hypocrisy, for it leads to neither spirituality nor righteousness. Sometimes hypocrisy is caused by sinister motives, as indicated above, but often, too, it results from a simple desire for a social approval or a weakness in carrying out good intentions. (For a good scriptural passage on hypocrisy see Matt. 6:1-18.) (5) Sterile orthodoxy. We do not imply by this term that orthodoxy itself is wrong. As a matter of fact, those Latter-day Saints who are completely orthodox will accept the dynamic principle of creative expression and progression along with the idea of obedience to specific commandments. (See Doc. And Cov. 58:26-29. Refer also to the third Social Science lesson for last year, "The Road to Righteousness," and particularly to that section of it called "Obedience plus." ) It is when orthodoxy becomes sterile that it is wrong; when it is satisfied with mechanical conformity alone; when it stifles the divine spark in man, the creative urge, and makes of him a mere robot or puppet that can be pushed around. Sometimes people lose the real spirit and substance of religion by overstressing mechanical adherence to its forms alone. ("The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.'?II Corinthians 3:6.) (6) Fanaticism. This refers to a lack of balance in religious perspective; a tendency to be dogmatic, narrow, and oppressive. Religion to be valuable should harmonize with life. We can have tolerance without indifference; broadmindedness without shallow-mindedness; conviction without fanaticism?and we should have. There is little room in real religion for the narrow bickerings and the dogmatic assertions that sometimes find expression within the portals of the church. (7) Passivism. This is the practice of taking religion passively, of being a member of the church but not doing anything about it, of remaining inactive and indifferent. To be really effective religion must be of the active variety. There are sins of omission as well as commission, and to get the most out of the church one must participate in its programs. It will be a sad day for many when they look back and realize "what might have been." Church membership can and should mean much more to the individual than passive convenience or expediency. (8) Crisis religion. Closely related to passivism is the practice of turning to the church only when in trouble. Coming out of World War II is the statement that "There are no atheists in foxholes." It is good that men will usually turn to God when their backs are against the wall, so to speak, but it is unfortunate that they don't turn to him more at other times. A religion that is based primarily upon fear tends to motivate worship in times of crisis only, and because of this it fails to lift men to the greater joys that life has to offer. (g) Compartmentalism. Religion to be effective should be integrated with total life. But with many, unfortunately, it is kept as an undigested segment of life, good for Sunday but impractical for any wider application. Men too often compartmentalize their lives; pigeonhole their morals; segregate their principles and practices. Theology is too often divorced from practical present-day application. Spirituality is too often missed. Religion should be taught more in terms of life. The church should be a vital part of every community, willingly and actively engaged in the war against sin and injustice as they exist today. (10) Institutionalism. Sometimes we err by shifting too much attention from the individual to the church; by emphasizing the church for its own sake with little thought of the people it is to serve; by over standardizing worship and morals. When Jesus said "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath" (Mark 2:27), he might just as well have said "The church was made for man and not man for the church." All institutions are made for man, and when they cease to serve him they end their usefulness. It is dangerous to promote any institution for its own sake. Religious programs should spring from the interests and the needs of the people more than they sometimes do; there is no virtue in putting over a program for its own sake. Records should be emphasized less and actual achievement more; there is no real value in a "one-hundred per cent" achievement record unless it stands for work well done. It is the people who are important, more than the institution, and the programs and measuring devices used should always be constructed with their welfare in mind. Moral Guides for Modern Saints Being a Latter-day Saint is a good guarantee of righteous living. The great moral principles of the ages are entirely compatible with the teachings of Mormonism, and the visions of truth and eternity which Mor-  LESSON DEPARTMENT monism supplies are enough to inspire man and call forth the best that is in him. But being 4 Latter-day Saint means more than just having your name on the books, more even than obeying blindly the letter of the law. It means honesty based upon truth and intelligence, industry based upon activity and effort, and justice based upon love and courage. Being a good Latter-day Saint means living righteously in every sense of the word. With a love for God and a desire for righteousness, modern saints should strive for the good life in all of its aspects, including the following: Eternal joy in place of sensual pleasure Struggle and growth rather than immediate comfort Responsible freedom rather than reckless license Honesty in place of expediency Truth instead of proof Right instead of might Principle rather than profit Vitality instead of conformity alone Courage in place of cowardice Conviction without intolerance Tolerance without indifference Love in place of hate Optimism instead of pessimism Faith instead of skepticism In concluding this lesson series, let us resolve to live above the petty and 143 the commonplace; to be large in vision and big in soul; to look up, and laugh, and love, and climb, and fight, and do. Let us resolve to devote all our might for the right. Problems for Thought and Action 1, Explain the phrase "soul erosion"; ""unpublished casualty lists." What are the three approaches that can be made to truth? Why is it a mistake to exclude any one of them? Show how a denial of religion can lead to both error and immorality. What is meant by the "fringe of righteousness'? Show how religion to some is a mere verbalism; a Sunday mannerism, Why must real religion be more than these? What is meant by "religious carry-over'? Discuss each of the ten religious perversions outlined in the lesson. Do you agree Or disagree with these points? Why or why not?
