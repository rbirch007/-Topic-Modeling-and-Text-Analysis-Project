Music Notes Dr. Florence J. Madsen Member Relief Society General Board "We can impart to others only that which we know." THE truthfulness of this statement comes  sooner or later to all of us who try to serve in the organizations of our Church. Just as soon as we are required to give from our meager store of knowledge, we realize that if the giving is to continue for long, we must find ways and means to replenish the storehouse. Fortunately, through the printed page, there have been preserved for us the finest thoughts and ideas of the greatest men and women throughout the ages. Whatever the chosen subject, there is printed material in abundance to cover any phase of that subject. Those who are called to take over the music of any of the auxiliaries of the Church should have access to some standard music textbooks. The Relief Society library of each ward should have in it three books on music which are at all times available to the chorister and to the accompanist. These books are: a music dictionary, a book on the fundamentals of music, and a book on conducting. The conductor and the accompanist should always work together in perfect harmony. Each should give and take to better the cause. All problems should be solved before new music is presented to the singers. Rhythm patterns should be rehearsed sufficiently so that they are not merely attached but are a very part of oneself. Foreign words indicating tempo or speed of the rhythm should be pronounced correctly and defined accurately. All expression marks or signs should be understood and adhered to. The aim should always be to understand all things that appear on the printed page of music and to impart this knowledge to the singing group. Those who are learning to conduct will find it most helpful to practice before a large mirror where they can see their motions and bodily posture. All conductors should use a baton as it is much easier to follow and understand than the varying gestures of the hand. The accompanists should be thoroughly familiar with all the. Accompaniments of songs to be rehearsed or sung. They should be able, at any time, to leave the accompaniment and give help to any part or parts that need help. This often requires that the accompanist read from three different staves simultaneously. This is rather a difficult thing to do and requires considerable practice. A great musician said: The conductor of a singing group may be quite ordinary, but with the help of a fine accompanist, can do extraordinary work, while, on the contrary, the fine conductor et a poor accompanist can accomplish little. MUSIC NOTES The singing group can progress to no greater heights than the leadership can take it. We never reach perfection, but we are ever on its trail. Joy comes with every new thing learned and shared with others, so we should avail ourselves of any opportunity to improve our talents. Note: The General Board recommends that each ward Relief Society purchase three of the five books listed below and keep them available for reference. It is suggested that these books be carefully preserved in order that they may be used from year to year, and that someone be held responsible for them. 127 Suggested References: CORNWALL, SPENCER, Fundamentals of Conducting....................$.50 Etson, Louis Charles, Pocket Music Dictionary Paper COVER..........$..50 Cloth cover .........-$1.75 GEHRKENS, Kart Witson, Essentials in Conducting................----$1.75 GEHRKENS, Kari Wison, The Fundamentals of Music............$1.50 SMITH, Leo, Musical Rudiments $1.00 These books are available at the Deseret Book Company, 44 East South Temple Street, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. A PRAYER Celia Van Cott Lord, we give thanks? The sword is sheathed; the bullets cease, Across the earth we hope for peace; White doves are loosed to fly Unmolested through the sky. Bring comfort, Lord, to those who yearn For loved ones who will not return, To crippled lads and those in pain? Teach them to live and laugh again. Cleanse hearts of hate, O Lord, with your giving, Touch eyes gone blind; teach us Christ's way of living. DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 16?
