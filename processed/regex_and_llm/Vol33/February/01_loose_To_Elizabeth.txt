TO ELIZABETH Olive M. Nicholes The notes take wing beneath your finger tips; On bright, ecstatic pinions beat the air Like larks, still rising up until the lips, In unison, burst forth in glorious song. Even the scales—like busy little quail Running through blowing grass the whole day long, Twitter and nod each black, top-knotted crest. Beethoven's, Brahm's, and Mozart's melodies Live, re-created in your soul, thrice blest, While I, who held your head against my heart, Can only marvel at the miracle: That of this splendid one, I share a part.
