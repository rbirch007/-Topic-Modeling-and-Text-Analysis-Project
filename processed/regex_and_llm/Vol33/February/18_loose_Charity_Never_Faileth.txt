Charity Never Faileth Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, May 7, 1946 Objective: To encourage people to put their trust in charity as the unfailing means of improving themselves and of influencing others for good. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophecy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.... For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity (I Cor. 13:8 ff). Paul wrote these words to the Corinthian saints because they were disputing among themselves about the relative importance of certain spiritual gifts. Some saints were making a show of the gift of tongues ?causing confusion, envy, and strife in their meetings. Paul did not intend to minimize the value of prophecy, the gift of tongues, and knowledge, but he knew that the things we know in part shall "be done away" with when a fulness of knowledge comes. He asked only that the Corinthian saints entertain a proper sense of values and cease having disputations concerning divine gifts. Love is at the heart of the gospel of Christ. The development of love and of the other great attributes of Deity in the lives of individuals and in society is the chief aim of the gospel. Prophecy, knowledge, and spiritual gifts inspired of Deity will always contribute towards this purpose. The passing of time has not changed the value of Paul's emphasis on charity or love. Love is still the first commandment and the end of our religious striving. Other things in life, not in harmony with love, shall pass away. Knowledge alone, for example, will not bring us peace; knowledge alone will not enable us to rear our children in paths of righteousness; prophecies, the gift of tongues, a theoretical knowledge of the gospel alone will not guarantee us a happy and successful life together in the Church or in the world. All of these things, to be of value, must be accompanied by the spirit of love. It is growth in love and good will based on gospel-living which will endure and never fail us. Paul's counsel to the Corinthians applies with equal force to us today. Let a husband and wife make decisions with charity as well as with knowledge, for their decisions will pass but their love will endure. Let a mother counsel her children with love as well as with knowledge, for a proud youth may not heed his mother's words but he will not forget her  love. Let the worker in the Church Or a tinkling cymbal," Let us put labor with the love of Christ lest his our faith in love and never neglect Words "become as Sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.? Let us put our faith in love and never neglect it. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 8-Bible Influence as Revealed in Children?s Literature D. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, May 21, 1946 LITERATURE for children had its beginning in folk lore. Out of the wealth of stories created in the long-ago for fireside entertainment and to impress life lessons have come many stories of appeal for both young and old. Youth enjoys the story; age gets more of the inner meaning from it. In this time tested literature is a rich heritage for all.
Among these treasures are Aesop's fables?a collection of little tales, mainly of Greek origin, each carrying its moral. Legend has woven some interesting stories about Aesop. He is said to have been a pedagogue or teacher, full of quaint wit and wisdom. Certain it is that the tales credited to him preserve in living form some helpful maxims; for example:
THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF
A young shepherd tending his flock on a hillside not far from a village, decided to have some sport; he suddenly cried, "Wolf, Wolf!"
Immediately there was a scurrying of the men from town up the hills to help tend his sheep. But when they came puffing up to where he was, they found him laughing at his trick.
Next day he tried the same foolish trick. Again the men came by his help, and again they were laughed at by the silly shepherd. On the third day, a wolf really did come. The boy shouted and shouted but no one walked up his help. Some of the flock were killed before the men, in the tow. A liar is not believed even when he does tell the truth.
Action centered in a simple but interesting plot, with appropriate conversation to add life, makes these fables of Aesop rare stories. Added to this they impress practical life lessons. Each class member will recall some of the good old fables that Aesop, or someone else, has bequeathed to us. These stories are not linked with the Bible, but they are in keeping with its helpful teachings.
Legends are another type of stories which not only charm but often teach. One the writer has carried in pleasant memory for years is that of Androcles and the Lion. It tells a tale of a Greek slave who was saved by a lion from whose wounded foot he had extracted a large, painful thorn.
 LESSON DEPARTMENT 133 Later, Androclus, captured by the Romans and trained as a gladiator, met the same lion in the arena. The beast bounded forward to attack, but stopped. It would not fight its friend. The Emperor, learning the reason, ordered both Androclus and the lion freed. This is just a legend?blending some historical facts with fancy? but it impresses the value of kindness to animals. The story of Damon and Pythias is another legend portraying loyal friendship. Many similar stories have been passed down to us. Like Aesop's fables, they were created before Christianity came to the Greeks, but many of them are in consonance with the Christian spirit. Another type of story created and preserved by the common folk is the fairy tale. To the Grimm Brothers ?early day students of language and folklore?we are indebted for a wealth of these and other folk stories. Created for fireside entertainment and told and retold down the years, many of these old stories have not only rhythmic charm but everyday goodness. Each will recall a favorite among these tales. One that has literally gone round the world is Cinderella. A story basically like it has been found even among the Indians, but instead of dainty glass slippers, the little red heroine wore beautifully beaded moccasins; and the hero, of course, was a fine young chieftain. Folk think of the Cinderella story as purely fanciful. It is all that and far more. It is true to life and true to truth. At heart its lesson is: Real worth will one day come into its own. An interesting thing about these old folk tales is the spirit of democracy that they radiate. Cinderella, the faithful little kitchen maid, wins the prince. In Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, recreated recently in a colorful photoplay by Walt Disney, we have the same intermingling of folk of high and low degree. Those characters possessing home virtues always win in the best of the fairy tales preserved by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. Mother Goose, of course, must not be forgotten. Where this quaint old creature came from, with her jingles and her interesting folk of every type, no one surely knows. Some like to think she was a real person, but that seems not true. Nursery thymes that are linked with the name are probably just creations of the common people, mainly, of old England. No matter what the source of nursery thymes, they have fascinated children through the years. They are the first literature of tiny tots; they charm grandparents, too, or others who take time to share their music and fun with the lively boys and girls. Wholesome humor and entertainment sparkle in the best of the Mother Goose rhymes. They hold a wealth of human nature, too. This heritage of time-tested literature provides not merely recreation, but a basis of understanding and appreciation for all literature. No finer examples of storytelling can be found than in the folk tales. Having been passed in oral form along the stream of time, they are like the water-tumbled stones, rounded and polished. To survive folk criticism, the story had to have appeal for common people.  LESSON DEPARTMENT This is why homely virtues win praise; and good triumphs over evil in these classic tales. They offer a standard measurement with which to judge more modern creations. Further, because they have been woven into many of the more recent stones for old and young through language, allusions, and characters, it becomes doubly necessary that children and grownups get closer to this literary heritage. Best of all the story treasures from long ago are those from the Bible. Children, under the guidance of their parents, should grow up with these. Beginning with the ones that deal with childhood and youth as "Abraham and Isaac," "Joseph and His Brothers," "The Boy Samuel," "David, the Young Shepherd," the "Story of the Christ Child," boys and girls can be led into a love of the Book of Books. No better practice than that of reading aloud in the home choice selections from the Bible can be recommended. This applies both from the viewpoint of implanting a love of gospel truth, and cultivating literary appreciation; for the Bible as we have it in the King James translation, is superb English literature. This may be plainly seen when its stories are properly voiced. Excellent books to help foster such appreciation are Hulbert's Story of the Bible for Young and Old and The Illustrated Bible Story Book by Seymour Loveland. Attractive 'other books portraying the Bible for young folk are also available. Of course the Bible itself is always a first reference. Literature created especially for children did not make its appearance to any great extent before about the middle of the nineteenth century. 135  What the little folk were given before that time was what might be called family literature?stories young and old might enjoy. One of the fireside favorites, along with Bible stories, was Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan. In her Little Women, Louisa M. Alcott pictures the joy she and her sisters had in following Christian, the hero of this allegory, in his soul-testing adventures on the way to the "Delectable Mountains." Robinson Crusoe, by Daniel Defoe, and Gulliver's Travels, by Jonathan Swift, are other adventure stories widely enjoyed round the hearth-sides of earlier days, except those of severely Puritan cast, where fiction was strictly ruled out. What these folk wanted for themselves and their children was the Bible. To train their young folk in the reading of the scriptures, they established their schools. An easy step to this end was provided in the New England Primer, which begins with this couplet: In Adam's fall We sinned all. School readers created later varied the strictly Biblical offerings somewhat, yet they kept a strongly religious tone. Even the famed McGuffey Readers, first published in 1879, keep close to the Bible in spirit and content. Love of God, love of nature, of home and friends, respect for parents, kindliness, charity, honesty and the other Christian virtues are all impressed with a choice selection of stories, poems, and other literature in the McGuffey Readers. "Rather old-fashioned," someone may remark, Yes, but in tribute to his great contribution to character building, American leaders ?Henry Ford among them?not so long ago joined in honoring the memory of James McGuffey, creator of the pioneer texts which bear his name. With the rise of the common schools came an increase in literature designed especially for children. Stories and poems for the young began to appear. Authors turned their talents more towards the creation of literature of appeal for little folk, and for youth. A few of them won literary fame through such creations. Among the first thus to rise was Hans Christian Andersen, of Denmark. His delightful stories, for children of all ages, spread beyond his native land to become a treasured possession?the best of them? of children everywhere. Some of these tales are, like those of the Grimm Brothers, just old folk stories preserved with Andersen's artistry. Others are of his own creation. In The Ugly Duckling we are given, so many think, a life picture of the author himself, as he was transformed from a boyhood of poverty and struggle to the life of a graceful writer, like the swan, admired by all. It is a story beloved by children everywhere for its sweetness of spirit and happy outcome. Five Peas in a Pod is another of Andersen's created tales that tells of God's gift of a little flower to bring health and happiness to a humble home. In our own country and England, a number of talented writers have bequeathed to young folk a wealth of choice literature. Any list of these authors would not, of course, represent the favorites of all our youth or their parents. Tastes and reading opportunities vary. Certain authors, however, will have place in practically every well-chosen selection of stories for the young?and this because what they create is interesting, artistic, wholesome. Their books can be safely read round any home fireside. A story of how one family built up a choice library may be helpful here. Inspired by the mother who read choice literature aloud to her children for evening recreation, the boys and girls of this family decided to help her enrich the home library. Their plan was simple. Carefully selected books were to be given as birthday and Christmas presents for several years. With the help of teachers and the mother, the books were chosen. As a result of this concerted effort new volumes began to brighten the o]d bookcase. Among them were the following: Little Women and Old Fashioned Girl by Louisa May Alcott; The Prince and the Pauper and Tom Sawyer by Mark 'Twain, Bird's Christmas Carol, and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm by Kate Douglas Wiggin; Helen's Babies by John Habberton; Adventures in Friend: ship by David Grayson; Hoosier School Boy by Edward Eggleston; Birds, Bees and Other Studies in Nature, by John Burroughs; Wild Animals I Have Known by Emest Thompson Seton; Boy's Life of Lincoln, by Helen Nicolay; Story of My Life by Helen Keller, A Watcher in the Woods by Dallas Lore Sharp; Wonder Book and Tanglewood Tales by Nathaniel Hawthorne; Sketch Book by Washington Irving; The Crisis by Winston Churchill; Boy Life on the Prairie by Hamlin Garland; Captain Courageous and The Jungle Books by Rudyard Kipling; The Honorable Peter Stirling by Paul Ford; Hero  LESSON DEPARTMENT Tales from American History by Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge. Added to these were poems by Riley, by Stevenson, by Eugene Field; and a collection of readings in prose and verse under the title of One Hundred Choice Selections. Best of all, the library was enjoyed; it was the center of the home. Not only the family, but many of the neighbors came informally to enjoy the sharing of its riches, especially when there was a story-sharing hour or an evening with the poets. Observe that there was a rich variety in the selection of books for that home library. All need a wholesome, varied diet for mind and spirit as well as for the body. One division that would seem to be lacking in this collection is books for little folk; but remember, it was boys and girls in their early adolescent years who helped build up the library here referred to. Had there been little ones among them, the list would doubtless have included Little Black Sambo by Helen Bannerman; Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter; Pinocchio by Collody; Heidi by Spyri; Mother Goose Village by Madge Bingham; Nursery Rhymes selected by Charles Welsh, or the richly illustrated Denslow's Mother Goose; and surely, if the choice were made now, Bambi by Felix Salton would not be forgotten. Neither would Little House in the Big Woods, and Little House on the Prairie, etc., by Laura Ingalls Wilder be omitted from the home library. Children's literature in these days is coming off the press in rapidly increasing quantity. "Of the making books," to quote scripture, "there is no end." Most of these created, 137 however, ate butterfly-like, showy, and just for a season. What ones will live and last only time can tell. Some are cleverly written; too few seem to possess classic qualities which give continuing joy. We need literature for entertainment, of course. It is only that which is read and reread, however, that brings recreation, uplift, wisdom. Our people should not only seek out choice literature for children from what has been and is being created; but also should encourage the creation by our own authors of children's literature of lasting quality. Great literature, we should remember, is lived before it is written. Out of the courageous living of the Latter-day Saints of more than a hundred years, materials of rarest quality have been made for great literature for young and old. The spirit of true authorship should be more assiduously cultivated. More attention should be given to studying and developing artistry of expression? not sophisticated style?but that which rings true, which is simple, concrete, Bible-inspired. Another vital need is more voicing of beautiful literature in our homes. 'There is no academy on earth," says Horace E. Scudder, "equal to a mother's reading to her child." Further, there is for all mothers the equivalent of a good many college courses in an earnest study of children's literature. 'There is joy also in cultivating a love of literature in children and guiding wisely their book companionship, in helping them tactfully to find for themselves the real gold. And now, may the writer pay loving tribute to his own mother. Whatever love and appreciation he has for literature has come primarily because she inspired it during his boyhood by voicing beautifully choice literature in the home. It is a precious memory. A reader sent me a short verse by Strickland Gillilan called "Wealth." I hope it impresses you as it did me. You may have tangible wealth untold, Caskets of jewels and coffers of gold. Richer than I, you never can be? I had a mother who read to me. Discussion and Activities 1, a?What is a story you have treasured from childhood?

Suggestions to Literature Class Leaders The following practical suggestions for teachers of the literature course have been sent to the General Board by the author of the 1945- 1946 literature lessons, Brother Howard R. Driggs. During his extensive traveling he has talked with many Relief Society class leaders. As a result of these conversations he has prepared the following suggestions: First: My advice to you teachers is?Study the Discussion Questions First. See whether, without reading the lesson, you can answer some of these questions in part or completely. Whether you can or not, you will be better prepared to _ study the lesson proper. You will also be better prepared to gather additional materials to enrich it. Second: Do not look too far afield for helpful materials. First of all, these lessons call for a better working knowledge of the Bible. They will serve as a review and give a new view of many of the well-known stories and other parts of that great book. Another thing: The lessons are so planned that most of the literature needed to make them come to life can be easily obtained from books in the home library, from literary texts that are being used by children in grades or in high school, and certainly, in the public library where such libraries are available.  LESSON DEPARTMENT I am making these suggestions because I feel that, first of all, teachers and class members are not appreciating the study questions and suggestions that follow the lessons. These have been worked out with great care and with the general membership of your organization in clear 139 view. They point the way towards fruitful activity that will help make the course alive and interesting. By considering these discussion questions and topics first, teachers will be helped to get away from the lecture method. One way to do this, even more effectively, is to let members of the class be assigned to lead in discussing the various questions. This will bring them to the class prepared for action.
