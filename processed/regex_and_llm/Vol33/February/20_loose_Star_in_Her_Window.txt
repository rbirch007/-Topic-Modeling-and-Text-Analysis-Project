STAR IN HER WINDOW Ruth H. Chadwick She looked beyond the silhouette of trees, Those blackened forms against a studded sky; A waning winter moon, now cupped, spilled seas Of fluorescent light to vivify The calm and tranquil pattern stars must live. They twinkled unperturbed, aloof, secure; Out there was peace, no man-made force to sieve The souls of men, and leave their goals obscure; No treachery, fomenting underneath, Would change their ways, now eons old and tried; They lighted up the infinite's great wreath Of circling firmament at eventide. For myriads can live in harmony, The stars would show the way that all might see. She looked beyond the view of naked eye, Around the globe's great seething holocaust; Hell's bursting fury, rockets in the sky, Rained death below; the red and deafening blast Of force was everywhere; decay and rot Attacked the brave and good with poisoned dart. And some of her was out there, too! The thought Set tingling echoes pounding in her heart. With hope and faith she touched the fringe that framed Her star; an earthly painted satellite, Devoid of warmth or glow, it mutely claimed To share the world's mad chaos, greed and spite. But this she knew, her star would prove its worth, And win the right to signal "Peace on earth." National BIBLES ?
