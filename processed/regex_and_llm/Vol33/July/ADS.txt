Lesson I Man's Pre-Earth Life For Tuesday, October 15, 1946 or several days Dr. And Mrs. Jones had looked forward to a night together at the theater. A much advertised three-act mystery play was the attraction. On the evening of the play, shortly before 496 time to depart for the show house, a telephone call notified the doctor of an accident, in which one of his patients was involved. Arranging for a taxi to take his wife to the theater, he promised to join her as soon as he had rendered the necessary assistance to the injured person. The curtain was rising on the second act when at last Dr. Jones took his place at the side of his wife. With his mind unprepared by the first act, he watched the second act develop the complicated mystery which had been introduced before his arrival. As the curtain fell, he had no clear conception of the play and hoped during the intermission to be enlightened by his wife concerning the nature of the plot as it had been portrayed during the first act. At that moment an usher tapped him on the shoulder and whispered, "Dr. Jones, there is a telephone call for you." A new emergency had arisen, and Dr. Jones was forced to leave the theater without having heard an explanation of the first act or having witnessed the clarification that the last would have given. His mind was in a state of bewilderment. The conduct of the actors, their conversation, and the implications and suspicions aroused during the second act of the play seemed to be a confusion of ideas. No wonder his opinion of the play was expressed by his words: "It's a meaningless jumble to me?it doesn't make sense!"' In similar fashion, most of mankind is bewildered by the spectacle of mortal existence, its confusion and the conflicts that are seen on every hand. 'The observable differences in mental capacity, color of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 skin, and geographic location of various peoples seem manifestly unfair in view of a belief in a just God. The manner in which apparent sinners are blessed, while the more righteous suffer untold hardships, anguish, and distress, cause misgivings in the minds of many people concerning the power of God in our lives.  The great number of people who choose evil instead of good or become confused in trying to decide what is most worthwhile in life, makes the scene of human existence one that may appear to be without ultimate purpose or goal. The reason for this apparent confusion is to be found in the fact that (according to our present knowledge) earth life is but the second act or period of a three-act drama of eternal living pre-existence and the hereafter being the first and the third. When an attempt is made to judge the entire plan on the basis of what we observe during its second phase only, it may seem as meaningless to us as the mystery drama did to Dr. Jones. We need to know something of the first period of existence to understand the purpose of the second state, and the third division of existence must be understood in order to comprehend the entire plan of salvation. One of the most basic truths taught by the restored gospel is the fact that man had a conscious existence before he was born on earth. In a revelation given to Joseph Smith, the Lord revealed some enlightening facts concerning the eternal nature of man. He declared:... I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the first-born... Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; LESSON DEPARTMENT that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of truth... Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be. All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also, otherwise there is no existence. Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man, because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light... For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receiveth a fulness of joy (Doc. And Cov. 93:21, 23, 29, 3% 31, 33, 34)- Having fathered the spirits of mankind (see Numbers 16:22 and 27:16), God most certainly gave them opportunity for development in those things which were necessary for their advancement. The Eternal Father revealed to Moses that all of his physical creations are purposeful (see Moses 1:33). Knowing this, we can be sure that he would provide the spirits of mankind with some type of purposeful activity and instruction. Just what the nature of this training period was has never been revealed. It was certainly, however, calculated to prepare the spirits for the proper choice in the decision that each must ultimately make. When this training was completed a great council was called in heaven. Here the Father's will was revealed, and a plan proposed for the next stage in the development toward a fulness of joy The plan recognized the need for the creation of bodies of tangible matter in which the spirits that God had created could be embodied. But from this point onward Lucifer and Jesus differed markedly. Satan urged a universal salvation by compulsion for every spirit-child of God, and 497 in addition, he desired to take to himself the honor and glory which belonged to the Father (see Isaiah 14:12-14). Jesus agreed to carry out the Father's will and urged that the opportunity for salvation be given to all, contingent upon the exercise of the free agency of the individual and all the glory be to the Father forever. This was apparently in keeping both with the will of the Father and the previous training of his spirit children. Upon acceptance of the Father's will by Jesus, Satan attempted to impose his plan by force, and then each spirit was given the opportunity to exercise its intelligence and agency. Satan led away one-third of the spirits with him, but the others became heirs of salvation, depending upon their faithfulness and obedience (see Abraham 3:24-28). Individual differences must have existed in this pre-existent state just as they were to appear later in earth life. These differences were apparently the consequences of the effort and diligence exercised by the individual spirits. In a vision, Abraham was permitted to see something of this difference in development that had taken place during the period of pre-mortal existence: And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all... 1 dwell in the midst of them all... I rule in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath _ over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen from the beginning; I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen. Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before 498 the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; and God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits.. And he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born (Abraham 3:19,21-23). This scripture introduces us to the doctrine of foreordination. Abraham learned that he had been chosen to a position of spiritual leadership long before his earthly birth. A careful study of Abraham 3:19 and 21 indicates that his selection for leadership on earth must have come about because of his greater intelligence and superiority of character that had been gained during his pre-existent life. It was not a result of favoritism on the part of God, nor a capricious whim of the Eternal Father. Rather, it was a reward for meritorious service. God, who is all-wise, could certainly foresee the greatness of Abraham's character and trustworthiness. However, there was no compulsion attached to the selection. Abraham had the right to fulfill the position of leadership assigned to him in the pre-existence, but he could also have rejected the calling. In_ this manner we see that people may be foreordained for certain assignments, but they are not forced to comply. Biblical evidence of this doctrine of foreordination is found in the words of the Lord to the Prophet Jeremiah: Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and J ordained thee a prophet unto the nations (Jeremiah 1:5). RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 Brigham Young explained the principle of foreordination in these words: It is a mistaken idea that God has decreed all things whatsoever that come to pass, for the volition of the creature is as free as air. You may inquire whether we believe in foreordination; we do, as strongly as any people in the world. We believe that Jesus was foreordained before the foundations of the world were built, and his mission was appointed him in eternity to be the Savior of the world, yet when he came in the flesh he was left free to choose or refuse to obey his Father... We also are free to choose or refuse the principles of eternal life. God has decreed and foreordained many things that have come to pass, and he will continue to do so; but when he decrees great blessings upon a nation or upon an individual they are decreed upon certain conditions (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 85; 1941 edition, page 55). Having progressed to the point in the pre-existent state that the organized spirits had undergone the necessary apprenticeship, they were ready for the second act of the eternal drama. It was necessary for these intelligent spirits to be embodied in mortality, where new experiences could be gained. Accordingly, preparations were made for this next period of development, namely, that of mortality on this earth. Discussion and Activity Problems. What can we learn concerning Jesus Christ from Ether 3:6-16 and John 1:1-14; 6:62; 16:28; and 17:1-5?. To what extent can an understanding of the pre-existence influence our daily conduct during mortality?. Practically all Christian sects believe  LESSON DEPART MENT that life begins at birth. What reasons can you resent to show that this view is both unsatisfying and inconsistent? Social Science The Family Social Science Committee, 499 References Smith, Pres.

Lesson The Family Unit Eternal For Tuesday, October 22, 1946.. Whatsoever you seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens THE purpose of the family unit is twofold: first, to bring spirits into the world, that they may receive mortal bodies; and second, to provide an environment suitable to the proper growth and development of those spirits, that they may be worthy to return to the presence of God. The home is the foundation and bulwark of society. Its sanctity must be ever guarded if we are to achieve the glorious destiny God has planned for us. Family life as viewed by Latter-day Saints is a long-range program which reaches into eternity and is perfect in its concept. If we live the principles of the gospel, we shall be able to carry out the purposes of. (Doc. And Cov. 132: 46). God and receive great joy and glory therefrom. God's Eternal Design Our lives will be more purposeful if we understand that God designed an eternal existence for us. Though our memory of the pre-existence has been taken from us, the gospel teaches that we lived in a pre-mortal state. What did that pre-existence do for us? There we were born spiritually, in that home we associated with the Father of our spirits. That life was a necessary preparation for the one we live here. Our life there was free from coercion. We were permitted to live in full fellowship with our Father or to be faithless and rebellious. If we chose the course of obedience, we developed with those who were faithful. We learned that progress comes through the acceptance of the gospel plan. We developed to the point where it was necessary to receive mortal bodies in order to progress further.
Then we were ready for the second estate. The Lord disclosed his purpose for us before we came to mortality, for we read in the Pearl of Great Price:
And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever (Abraham 3:24-26).
Being privileged to receive a body and enter into the second estate or mortal life is a great blessing.
We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the Celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man, and when cast out by the Savior he asked to go into the herd of swine, showing that he would prefer a swine's body to having none (Joseph Smith, Richards and Little's Compendium�"Gems," page 288).
Receiving a body is not only an opportunity for experience and development, but with mortality comes responsibility. Man is given his free agency here upon earth. He is free to choose the path he will follow but must account for the actions of this life. Through proper living of the gospel we are entitled to know right from wrong, truth from error.
The gospel plan, if followed, will bring joy and happiness in this estate as well as in the life to come. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, "Happiness is the object and design of our existence and will be the end thereof if we pursue the path that leads to it."
Divine Institution of Marriage
The opening drama of human existence upon this earth was introduced by God, who created man. He approved the companionship of Adam and Eve for he said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an helpmeet for him . . . And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man" (Gen. 2:18,22).
President Joseph F. Smith said:
This institution of marriage is not a man-made institution . . . God not only commends but he commands marriage. . . He united our first parents in the bonds of holy matrimony, and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth . . . Marriage is the preserver of the human race. Without it, the purposes of God would be frustrated (Gospel Doctrine pp. 341, 342).
If those who enter into marriage would realize that it is God's eternal plan by which spirits come into the world, there would arise a new dedication and high resolve to faithfully fulfill the purpose of creation.
President Smith also said:
Neither are the relationships that exist, or should exist, between parents and children, and between children and parents, of an ephemeral nature, nor of a temporal character. They are of eternal consequence, reaching beyond the veil, in spite of all that we can do. The man, and the woman who are the agents, in the providence of God, to bring living souls into the world, are made before God and the heavens, as responsible for these acts as is God himself responsible for the works of his own hands, and for the revelation of his own wisdom. The man and the woman who engage in the ordinance of matrimony are engaging in something that is of such far-reaching character, and is of such vast importance, that thereby hangs life and death, and eternal increase. Thereupon depends eternal happiness, or eternal misery (Gospel Doctrine, page 342).
Marriage for Eternity
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes in marriage for eternity. This is one of the great truths revealed in the latter days. When we enter worthily into one of the temples and have a servant of the living God marry us for time and eternity, there comes to us one of the greatest blessings bestowed upon mortals. Two lives have been united in companionship for eternity.
President Heber J. Grant said:
The blessings and promises that come from beginning life together, for time and eternity, in a temple of the Lord cannot be obtained in any other way. Worthy young Latter-day Saint men and women who so begin life together find that their eternal partnership under the everlasting covenant becomes the foundation upon which are built peace, happiness, virtue, love, and all of the other eternal verities of life, here and hereafter.
I believe that many of the troubles of
those Latter-day Saints who have sorrow in their homes and difficulties with their families come from neglect in carrying out the commandments of God, one of the most important of which concerns temple marriage. Much sorrow is chargeable to indifference to this and other requirements (Gospel Standards, page 153).
President Brigham Young said:
There is not a young man in our community who would not be willing to travel from here to England to be married right, if he understood things as they are; there is not a young woman in our community who loves the Gospel and wishes its blessings, that would be married in any other way (Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 302-303).
Even the grave is not the end of our marriage, but only a gateway leading into an enlarged sphere of endless progression. As a loving companion gazes upon the lifeless remains of his beloved, he realizes that the spirit is not there but has gone to join those who have victoriously overcome the world. While in this life we have friends and relatives, there is an indescribable joy in having a devoted wife or husband with whom to share one's happiness. If that is true in this life, it will be increased in the world to come.
If marriage is solemnized in the temple, by those who hold the proper authority, a glorious opportunity is presented:
Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them (Doc. and Cov. 132:20).
Every Latter-day Saint should be inspired by this exalted destiny  LESSON DEPARTMENT offered to him. Our hearts should throb with a new determination to claim this blessing, and we should seek to impress on all our associates who do not understand it, the vital importance of obtaining this blessing. Eternal Glory Obtained by Obedience to Law The grandeur of this philosophy of eternal marriage should inspire us in our family circles to more righteous living. With this philosophy we should labor more diligently each day to secure our family unit eternally. There will be problems to solve each day, but with such an inspiring principle we should be able to surmount each crisis. 'The spirit of the Lord abiding in our homes will minimize the troubles and sorrows of life, and enhance the joys of companionship. When a couple is married in the temple, their blessing is predicated upon obedience to law. 'Transgression results in a denial of eternal blessings. Eternity is not gained in a single bound. Each day we build for eternity through righteous conduct in, our daily lives. Temple marriage is a glorious experience for any couple. 'The peaceful and beautiful surroundings are most impressive and uplifting. Having a servant of God perform the ceremony one holding the priesthood with the power to seal on earth and it shall be sealed in the heavens, makes the union sacred and binding. Young people should be trained from childhood to live up to the requirements for entrance into the House of the Lord, then last-minute 503 reforms will not be necessary. They should be taught the benefits of temple marriage so that they will prepare themselves and look forward to this great privilege. Our children who are born in the Priesthood are legal heirs, and entitled to the revelations of the Lord... (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 303). Our family units will be secured by our obedience to the law of the gospel, and this obedience will entitle us to "pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there..." (Doc. And Cov. 132:19) to our exaltation. Guidance for Discussion 1, What truths are revealed in scripture regarding our pre-existence? (Pearl of Great Price: Abraham 3:21-23; Moses 3:5; Book of Mormon: Ether 3:15-16; Doc. And Cov. 93:29.) 2. Did our conduct in pre-existence have any influence upon our life in mortality? (Abraham 3:24-26.) 3. What effect does the concept of the divine institution of marriage have upon our family living? 4. In what sense does temple marriage have a stabilizing effect on the family? 5.
