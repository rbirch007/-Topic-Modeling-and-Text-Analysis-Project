Opportunities at Brigham Young University for the Youth of the Church President Howard S. McDonald EVENTY years ago, President S Brigham Young called Karl G. Maeser to Provo to establish an institution of learning which should be fundamentally and essentially a Latter-day Saint school, a school wherein all functions would reflect fully and completely the spirit and genius of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Under the inspirational leadership of Presidents Karl G. Maeser, Benjamin Cluff, Jr., George H. Brimhall, and Franklin S. Harris, Brigham Young University has grown from a few students to the present enrollment of over thirty-two hundred young men and women. 'The physical facilities have grown from vacant rooms in downtown business houses to an entire block of buildings on the lower campus, and to four modern buildings on the upper campus. The building program for the future points to the realization of many more needed buildings for the University in the next few years. What does Brigham Young University offer to young men and women? In the college of applied science students may obtain bachelor of science degrees in the following fields: agronomy, animal husbandry, bacteriology, horticulture, landscape architecture, mechanic arts, and home economics. This article will not permit an extensive summary of each of the courses, but the main objective in our home economics course is to teach our young people the mechanics of operating a modern home, and to instill into the hearts of every student the ideals of the Latter-day Saint home. The primary purpose of the curriculum offered in the college of arts and sciences is to meet the needs of the students who desire a broad and liberal education that will enable them to find and take their places in the complex civilization of today. Abundant opportunity is provided for those who have ambition for specialized study in engineering, medicine, or law; or for those who desire to train for political or social leadership. Students who desire to prepare for the professions will find this college filled with studies which are fundamental. The college of commerce provides training for leadership in industry and finance. Courses are so arranged that students will be given the training that will best fit them for analyzing business conditions, for efficiency in office administration, and for the demands of the industrial and financial world. The college of education is one of the professional schools of the University. Its function is the training Page 435 436 of teachers. Never in the history of the world has there been such a demand for well-trained teachers. Today, four hundred thousand well-trained teachers are needed to fill the needs of the public schools in the United States. Brigham Young University meets the requirements of the Utah State Board of Education for the various grades of elementary and high school certification, and for certificates and diplomas in administration and supervision. The college of fine arts is excellently prepared to provide Opportunities to those who desire to follow these fields of study. Well organized courses are offered in the following fields: Art ? drawing, painting, modeling, design, history, and appreciation; Music theory, instrumental, vocal: Speech public speaking, dramatic art, play production, speech correction, radio. It is the purpose of the division of religion to carry out the important viewpoint of a proper blending of religious and moral values with secular knowledge. When a student has completed his courses at Brigham Young University, he should not be left in doubt in regard to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Brigham Young University has a fully organized graduate school where students may continue their studies for advanced degrees in the subjects taught in the various colleges. The master's degree has been recognized on the campus for many years. Plans are being formulated for the establishment of the doctor of philosophy degree in theology and other fields of study. For the benefit of servicemen, a full quarter of eleven weeks will be conducted during the summer months. HE various courses offered at Brigham Young University have been very briefly summarized. Now, why do students from all parts of the world attend this University? Here are the reasons of four students: Willis Waite from San Diego, California, says: California is my home. In this State are found many of the most famous institutes of learning in the world; indeed, the educational opportunities for its youth are vast and varied. Notwithstanding these impressive facts, I found my inclinations, at that time in my life when it was necessary for me to choose at which university I should receive my education, led me to regard that belonging to my Church as the one ideally suited to my purpose and aspirations. I was not deterred by the realization that if I did become a student at Brigham Young University, it would inevitably mean I must travel some distance from my home, my loved ones, and my friends. I consequently made the whole project a matter of prayer. In the meantime, arrangements had been made for my enrollment at the University of California, but, in spite of this, without any hesitation I ultimately decided for the B. Y. U. I presented myself at the "Y" with full confidence that in so doing I was in harmony with the will of my Heavenly Father. I was immediately impressed with the unusual spirit which prevailed throughout the school. Everywhere, friendliness was the order of the day; and it not merely manifested itself among the students but in a close bond of helpful intimacy between students and faculty. From the first, the knowledge that those at the head of this institution and the professors in the classroom held the priesthood of God and had a knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which I so dearly love, gave me a wonderful feeling of confidence, a sense of deeper understanding which was not confined to the precincts of the classroom, but was a part of every social activity also. I have a grand feeling of belonging here, of being a part of the school. It offers me not only the best in academic learning, but teaches me (in contrast with so many of our universities) that there is a Father in heaven who loves his children. It teaches me the power of prayer. It teaches me, in general, the fundamentals of human happiness. The traditions of Bingham Young University have become important in my scheme of things. I have found so many things to admire, some to love, and not a few to make me exceedingly humble and thankful for my being here. Lucile Rose from New Jersey writes: What does Brigham Young University offer a young Mormon from New Jersey? I think that this question can be answered in three fields; that of education, of travel, and of everyday religious contacts. Besides the opportunity of a general education and specialized training in various fields, Brigham Young University opens one's eyes to the fact that the professors are, in themselves, remarkable people. In high school, one often felt his teachers were not real persons who had gone through similar experiences. There is much to be gained through associations with such accomplished persons as are on the Brigham Young University faculty. This school also offers everyone the equal chance to grow and to develop his talents. Each person may expand his personality in a school where money and clothes are not of first-rate importance. There is a constant cry for talent, and organizations like Lambda Delta Sigma, which are open to everyone, are a good way to develop one's talents. Second, Brigham Young University offers one from the East the opportunity to travel, not only on the journey here, but also during the week-ends and vacation periods. One becomes acquainted with many grand people who live here and who are only too glad to show you their communities. Some of the most beautiful land in the country is here in the West: national parks, mountains, and awe-inspiring canyons. These travels help one to know and understand the problems of other peoples. Thus, one's scope and culture are broadened. The third field, that of everyday religious contacts, is to me of utmost importance. Here, at Brigham Young University, we have the opportunity of observing and living with the Latter-day Saints in Zion. The lifelong friendships that are made with other Latter-day Saints from all parts of the country some even from outside the country are invaluable. In a school such as this the people are naturally more friendly because they have so much in common. Brigham Young University is often spoken of as a matrimonial school. This is very true and is easily comprehended. Our religion is quite different in many aspects from any other. Therefore, it is of much importance to us as individuals to marry someone who believes as we do. To this university come Latter-day Saints from everywhere, many hoping to meet the person with whom they would like to live for time and all eternity. With so much in common, it is only natural that many meet these partners and marry them. In conclusion, I would like to say that I believe that one's religion is put to more of a test here than in a place where there are very few Latter-day Saints. When in such a location one realizes that to the rest of the people he represents Mormonism and that he is watched every moment. As a Catholic friend of mine, who is attending the B. Y. U., feels that it is his mission so to live, so do we Latter-day Saints in the East feel that we are fulfilling an important mission by our very acts and deeds. Unfortunate as it may be, the majority of people in this world still judge by stereotypes. Therefore, we must be good examples, for we are told that not only shall we be accountable for our own deeds but also that we who possess a greater knowledge shall also be held responsible if we are stumbling blocks for anyone else. Here in Utah, one's religion is taken for granted, as so many of the people are Latter-day Saints. One does OPPORTUNITIES AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY 437 438 not have to defend himself in discussions or stand up for his beliefs as often as in other states. Therefore, many Jack 2 good knowledge of the gospel, something which every Latter-day Saint should have. Attending Brigham Young University has been an experience which I shall never forget. I only wish that I could thank all those who have been responsible for it. Moana Ballif from Provo, Utah, says: I came to Brigham Young University because: First, I believe the gospel of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I had a keen desire to be in a school where my education would be guided by the standards it teaches. I wanted to come to a university which was founded and developed so that young people could learn their religion while they were learning other facts in other fields. Second, I wanted to live at home while I got my education. The adjustment to college life is difficult enough without having to adjust to a completely new home environment and living habits. The advantages of living at home with sympathetic and understanding parents are many and varied, and constitute a very valid reason for staying at home for my college education. Third, it is doubtful if there is any other campus in the world where a person can associate with people of uniform backgrounds who have been taught a recognition of the value of high moral codes. I believed that here at B. Y. U. I could find students with whom I would be proud to associate and from whom I could select friends and companions. Fourth, I believed that here on this campus I could find men and women expertly trained and brilliant in their fields under whom I could study. Here, education was for the asking only, and with a little effort on my part I could come as near the ultimate in cultural education as anywhere in the United States. Here, I could find a philosophy and an education within my grasp. Here, I could study with professors who could lift me into the realms somewhere near the stars. Fifth, I decided that here was a school rich in a tradition which I wanted to have. Here, social life was given consideration on the campus. And, most important, the social program was filled with activities of a high standard in which | could participate and enjoy without being forced to decide between lowering, my standards or ignoring social life. Sixth, and finally, this was a school that I could help to build. It was a growing school on_ the road to unlimited development. Here was an institution dedicated to the principle of eternal progression, and, I thought, with all humility, that maybe I, too, could add a little bit to that pathway of eternal progression. I wanted to be one of the students who made positive the work of the men who founded this university with faith that others in the world might see our good works and realize the value of the gospel and what it means. Edith Russell, from London, England, writes: Oxford ? remote and unassailable. Study laborious striving to understand the obscure; without help, save that of prayer; without purpose, save that of self-vindication. A dread of ignorance and a passionate urge to emulate greatness. Absurd longings. Futile counting of pennies to buy the printed heritage of other men's brains. And then, democracy spilling over the ramparts of America, invading English shores. Opportunity. The distant University of Brigham Young opening wide its doors. Incredible. The consummate understanding and provision of God. 1 love it all; the quiet symphony of the great library; the muted music of struggle and achievement; the solemn tenor of slow-moving minds and the stimulating lilt of eager brains. And here, too, one may estimate with clearer eyes the noble heritage to which he is heir; feel the weight of it; experience the thrill of it; somewhere find the courage to accept it; and apply himself, vigorously, to carry it in his own two hands and lay it like balm on the wounds of the world.
