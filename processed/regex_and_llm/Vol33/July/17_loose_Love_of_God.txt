Lesson I Love of God For Tuesday, October 1, 1946 Objective: To show that the pioneers had a fundamental love of God, shown in their simple obedience to the principles of his truth. O the extent that man loves God, does he choose to keep the commandments of God. His love for his Maker is in a great measure proportionate to his desire and willingness to be obedient to divine laws and precepts, and to make personal sacrifices, when necessary, in order to conform to these laws and precepts. We read: If ye love me, keep my commandments. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.... If a man love me he will keep my words: and my Father will love him and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him (John 14:15, 21, 23). An outstanding example of a people united in their love of God, and in their faith in him is that of our pioneer forebears. For him and for the establishment of his kingdom, no sacrifice seemed too great. Like Job of old, they could say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." They knew that he heard and answered prayers; that he came to earth and restored the gospel in these latter days; and that he commissioned the saints, through their Prophet, to help in the establishment of his Church and in spreading the glad tidings throughout the Church. 'To this cause they were committed. They loved the Lord and chose to be obedient to him in all things, even to leaving their dearly beloved city. Colonel Thomas L. Kane, the faithful and devoted friend of the saints, who called at Nauvoo in September 1846, reports the sad conditions he found after their departure. 482 I procured a skiff, and rowing across the river, landed at the chief wharf of the city. No one met me there. I looked and saw no one.... I walked through the solitary streets.... I went into empty workshops... No work people anywhere looked to know my errand... I could have supposed the people hidden in their houses, but the doors were unfastened; and when at last I timidly entered, I found dead ashes white upon the hearths,., Fields upon fields of heavy headed, yellow grain lay rotting ungathered upon the ground. No one was on hand to take in their rich harvest... And in and around the splendid temple which had been the chief object of my admiration, armed men were barracked, surrounded by their stacks of musketry and pieces of heavy ordnance. -. It was after nightfall when I was ready to cross the river on my return,... And I landed where a faint glimmering light invited me to steer. There among the dock and rushes, sheltered only by the darkness, with no roof between them and the sky, I came upon a crowd of several hundred human creatures... These were Mormons in Lee County, Iowa, in the 4th week of the month of September, in the year of our Lord 1846 (Whitney, Orson F., History of Utah, I, page 275). Love of God has been the activating principle in all the accomplishments of Latter-day Saints from the day of the organization of the Church to the present time. To the degree that Latter-day Saints love the Lord, as shown by their obedience to the counsel and admonitions of his leaders, will the Church go forward in this day and the Lord's work on earth be consummated. Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting. See "Notes to the Field," page 450.) Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 SEWING is quite properly spoken of as an art. It is an art in that it is a form of creative expression. The woman who sews finds relaxation in her work just as the painter does in his canvas or the writer does in his manuscript. Sewing is a practical art and should have a place in every woman's life. We have mothers in our own Society who are unable to lower the hems of their children's skirts, and who must hire a seamstress to do even the smallest of sewing tasks. This should not be so. Every girl should know the simple fundamentals of home sewing both as a convenience and also for economy's sake. When a person learns to sew she also discovers a new use for her hands and her leisure time, and the satisfaction she feels in the completed article is an experience she will want to repeat again and again. An assignment has been given to the Relief Society to stimulate, in the women of the Church, a keener interest and greater activity in some of the neglected arts of homemaking. Therefore, we are presenting a simple course in the fundamentals of home sewing. These lessons will LESSON DEPARTMENT be outlined in the Magazine for study in the months October through May. It is optional with each ward or branch whether or not it will adopt this course. (See "Notes to the Field," page 450.) While it is doubtful if, in any ward or branch, every member of the Relief Society would wish to participate in this dressmaking course, it is the hope that in every ward and branch there will be some who will desire to study it. 'Those not participating in the sewing course may go right on with the other activities of the work meeting. The day should be kept friendly and informal. Welfare sewing, of course, is the first responsibility for work meeting and this optional sewing course should in no way interfere with this assignment. These lessons, it is felt, can be used to advantage in raising the standard of the welfare sewing, as well as giving assistance to the inexperienced sewer in the making of her own and her children's clothing. They will give the experienced sewer an opportunity to render real service by assisting those less experienced and, at the same time, give some help, even to more experienced sewers, by offering simple, time-saving, professional methods of sewing. The teachers chosen for this course need not be experts or professional seamstresses. Any member of the Relief Society who is experienced in practical home sewing will be able to interpret the outlines and teach the fundamentals of this course. The sewing course is planned to be simple and applicable, covering 483 each step from the thimble to the finished article. Lessons in technique and practical application of principles will alternate. We hope, at the close of the season, a fashion show or an exhibit may be held, at which time the women may model and exhibit the clothes they have made during the Relief Society season. It is the hope that each ward and branch Relief Society will do everything possible to stimulate attendance at work meetings, and inspire an ambition in each member to make at least one article of clothing during the year, in addition to the service she will render the Society as such. The titles for the eight lessons follow: Lesson 1. Choosing Right Clothes Special attention will be given to colors, fabrics, basic styles, and lines. Lesson 2. Use of Tools and Treatment of Materials Lesson 3. Measuring Commercial patterns will be interpreted and adjusted to individual measurements and cutting. Lesson 4. Stitches Different kinds of bastings and uses and treatment of raw edges and seams will be demonstrated. Lesson 5. Pinning, Basting, Fitting, Pressing Lesson 6. Button Holes, Fastencrs Lesson Finishing, 'Trimming, Collars, Bands, Hems and Pockets Lesson 8. Exhibit or Fashion Show A display of articles made during Relief Society season will be shown. The textbook recommended for use is The Complete Book of Sewing.  Lesson I
