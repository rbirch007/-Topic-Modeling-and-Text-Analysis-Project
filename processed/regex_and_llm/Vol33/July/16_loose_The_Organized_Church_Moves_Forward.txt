In this concluding series of the Church history lessons, there will be  need for supplementary reading material in addition to the Doctrine and Covenants and Essentials in Church History, the textbook for his course. Handbooks of instruction for the Priesthood quorums, the Relief Society, the Mutual Improvement and Primary Associations, the Sunday School and the Welfare Plan should be available. These need not be purchased, since copies are always at hand with appointed officers of the auxiliary organizations of the wards and branches of the Church. Do not lose sight of the place of the Doctrine and Covenants in this study. Here, the words you will read are the words of the Lord which ever illuminate the enduring principles of life. Through all the study let us not forget our repeating phrase from lesson to lesson� we must ''give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for us in this day. As to the method of class discussion, bear the following in mind: Somehow, in too many lessons, practically all o f the material is given in the written lesson itself. The teacher covers this part fairly well. When, however, she reaches the discussion period, she poses questions that draw a weak response. To this she must then supplement her own contribution. In overcoming such difficulty, there is the necessity of putting real content into the discussion period. In the case of the present series, this is done by directing class members to the words of the Lord as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Once a class, after attempting to answer a simple but searching question, is turned to the 476 clear and convincing facts as phrased by the Master, hearts are warmed; and minds, seeking ready confirmation of truth, recall personal illustrations which press for expression. Testimonies result, and the teacher assumes her rightful role as director, rather than taskmaster of the hour. Lesson 17 The Organized Church Moves Forward For Tuesday, October 1, 1946 Objective: To indicate how the expanding functions and offices in the restored Church developed. THE might of a great people is measured collectively. Upon the group as a whole, rather than upon its individual members, must the ultimate worth of a cause be known. It has been significant throughout the story of the rise of the Latter-day Saints that the Lord, in speaking of his Church, has always done so in plural terms. The promise given for the keeping of the Word of Wisdom, for example, reads, "And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings..." (Doc. And Cov. 89:18), not, and each saint who keeps these sayings. This is a significant fact both for the development of the Church, as well as for the good of each individual member, ~ for therein lies a strength twofold. By directing his promises for good living to the saints, the Lord, in effect, says, align yourself with my people and their cause, and you may be assured of the ultimate triumph of good. Something happens to one when such a promise is given. Desire to hold fast is strengthened, and within the heart rests the comfort of those eternal values that remain amid a world of change. What better way could God be forever calling his children into line! In our study of Church history the past two years, many and varied have been the shifting scenes that have depicted the rise of a mighty people ? the modern Israel. At times, when the dark clouds of oppression blackened the skies, it must have seemed to those who suffered most in the beginning years, that the promises of the Lord might come to naught. Had it not been for that enduring faith kindled eternally within the hearts of his most stalwart saints, certainly there could have been no rise of a nation of men and women who came from the far corners of the earth to bring again Zion in the last days. But now, as we look back over the history of the Church for a hundred years and more, we must feel that the world, too, will come to realize how great was that first vision of the boy prophet, Joseph Smith, that spring morning in the year of 1820. Yes, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has come of age. No longer need her people rest solely upon the revealed word of the Lord to sustain and defend their cause. Literally, within the lives and deeds of thousands and thousands of worthy saints, there rests the living testimony of a great work. These people are the fruits of the good tree. They are they whose lives become the pattern by which one may know the truth. And now, for those of us who LESSON DEPARTMENT have grown into the grove of good trees of the third, fourth, and even the fifth generation, let us take stock of our rich heritage in order to more fully appreciate the expanding function of the modern restored Church of our day. Its roots are deep, its foundation secure, its plan for the perfecting of the saints certain. Within the years of the more than a century since the first vision of Joseph Smith, many and wonderful have been the accomplishments of the modern Israel. These, if marked off in decades, May suggest, chronologically, some of the more important high lights of the Church events we have been studying during this course in Church history. Considered in connection with Latter-day Saint beliefs, as these have been Stated in the Articles of Faith, the Student of history may see how the guiding principles 20f Mormonism have been translated] into action and accomplishment. 1820?Year of the First Vision God not only spoke from the heavens, but saw fit to appear personally in company with his Only Begotten Son. Years later, the Prophet wrote, "We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." From the personal know]- edge of sight as well as hearing, Joseph placed with conviction each comma and conjunction in that sentence. God lives! He does speak! He can answer Prayer! He does direct his work to bring about the eternal life of man! Here is the firm foundation upon which the Church of Jesus Christ now rests, 477 1830?Year of Organization of the Church According to the laws of the State of New York and the nation of which it is a part, this religious body came into being. Since that day and as a result of the revelations given to the Prophet, there is upon the earth the same organization "that existed in the Primitive Church viz: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc." 1840 Year of the Incorporation of the City of Nauvoo The most inspiring structure in the mother of Mormon towns Nauvoo the Beautiful was the temple. It was the second such to be erected in the dispensation of the fulness of times, Inspired and blessed by the revelations God had already given his saints in Kirtland, the people of his choice now knew for a certainty the power of "the gift of tongues, Prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues." Everywhere, the peace of beautiful homes and thriving industries made Nauvoo a haven of though, had seen the bitter darkness that lay just ahead for him and his people, even as he then stood radiant in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the thickly darkening clouds. 1850 Year of Territorial Organization of Utah When the Prophet saw in vision the saints as a mighty people in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, he set their thinking toward scriptural 478 fulfillment of the prophecies of Zion redeemed. Later he wrote as the tenth articles of faith, "We believe.. That Zion will be built upon this (the American) continent." President Brigham Young, who led the Church in the beginning days of the fulfillment of these prophecies, saw the need for a new land under the control of democratic, constitutional freedom such as the founding fathers of our nation envisioned. It was with joy, therefore, that he and the saints heralded the news of President Millard Fillmore's appointment of federal officers for the Territory of Utah, in September of 1850. Brigham Young thus became the governor of the Provisional State of Deseret. Zion of the Americas seemed nearer at hand. 1860 Departure of Johnston's Army from Utah The struggle for righteous living among the saints brought bitter opposition in all their journeyings, even to the outposts of civilization? the Rocky Mountains. Tenaciously they stated their right to worship freely as: follows, "We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may." The Johnston's army episode in Utah brought to an end the era of mobs and armed force. The army came to subdue rebellion, and left having found none.. Its departure marked the beginning of brighter days for the Church whose claim for the freedom of worship | still stands. 1870Stakes of Zion Organized (Nine in Number) The coming of the 1870's marked the organization of twenty stakes of Zion. From Bear Lake on the north to St. George on the south, President Young had set firmly these organizations for the Church. "The literal gathering of Israel" was well under way. Within the outer reaches of the Intermountain Empire were planted the secure posts of refuge for the growth and development of the saints. In seven years that followed the opening of this decade, eleven of the twenty stakes were organized, so that, by 1877, the year of Brigham Young's death, men and women from the far corners of the earth knew of the standard upon Zion's hilltop. 1880 Fiftieth Anniversary of the Organization of the Church President John Taylor, in the year of the Golden Jubilee, revived again an old custom of Israel as recorded in the twenty-fourth chapter of the Book of Leviticus. The year was to be one of forgiveness in the Church. Throughout the stakes of Zion the need of service to the less fortunate was stressed. It was a year of thankfulness and praise to the Lord. 1900 Fiftieth Anniversary of the Preaching of the Gospel in Scandinavia and Hawaii. Two oceans had been spanned by the dawning of the twentieth century. The good word of the gospel had gone over both. Truly, the search for honest souls had become world-wide. How real then to the saints became the words of the LESSON DEPARTMENT third article of faith, that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel." 1930 Year of the Centennial Celebration of the Church ? one hundred years of Mormonism was Portrayed in fitting word and song from Salt Lake City to the most remote branches of the mighty People rejoiced - and "hoped all things" for the greater days that lay ahead, Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must �give heed unto his word.� 1. Any man who would be truly great must first be humble. As it is with a single man, so it is with people. The great events of the first century of Mormonism came to pass because God found humble men in the world who would listen to his word. What are the  characteristics of t rue humility? Have read again in class, the whole of the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, and note the parts for discussion which firmly uphold the qualities that have made our people great. 2. What historical events to be found in this lesson stand out for you as an illustration of the greatness of the Latterday Saints? Have members of the class discuss these in the light of the article of faith found therein. For further details of important Church events during the first century of Mormonism, refer to the appendix of Essentials in Church History, by Joseph Fielding Smith. Visiting Teachings� Messages-Our Pioneer Heritage President Amy Brown Lyman Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 "OUR PIONEER HERITAGE" is the general subject chosen for consideration in the Visiting teachers' department during the year 1046-47. Messages featuring pioneer virtues will be dwelt upon and will be discussed by the visiting teachers when making their monthly visits. These messages will be especially timely, appropriate, and interesting during this time� Utah's great centennial year� when the attention of members of the Church everywhere will be focused on the migration of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo, the City Beautiful, their trek across the dreary, uncharted plains, their dramatic entrance into their "Land of Promise," and their struggles to colonize a new, parched and barren wilderness. Of this migration the historian Bancroft says: There is no parallel in the world's history to this migration from Nauvoo. The exodus from Egypt was from a heathen land, a land of idolators, to a fertile region designated by the Lord for his chosen people . . . The pilgrim fathers in fleeing to America came from a bigoted people � a people making few pretentions to civil or religious liberty . . . Before this [migration] the Mormons had [already] been driven to the outskirts of civilization, where they had built themselves a city; this they must now abandon, and throw themselves upon the mercy of savages... (Bancroft's History of Utah, page 217). In our discussions and considerations we shall keep in mind, in addition to our 1847 pioneers, those who came in successive companies during the two decades which preceded the completion of the railroad to Salt Lake Valley, and also those other pioneers who settled in the outlying sections of Utah and in the adjoining states, and who demonstrated the same faith and courage, and experienced similar hardships and trials. We shall also remember the brave and courageous women the wives and mothers, whose help, encouragement, and service were mighty factors in all the great triumphs and outstanding successes of those early days. As we think of the accomplishments, the virtues, and the debt of gratitude we owe our own pioneers, we are very naturally reminded that in every phase of human endeavor there have been those who had the vision, the courage, and the daring to look ahead and prepare the way for others to follow. To all such who have made constructive contributions to the welfare of mankind, the whole world is indebted. Among these are those who have so successfully led the way into fields of scientific invention and discovery, who have so greatly advanced conditions of health and education, and who have made mighty progress in the direction of improved human relations. Many of these great leaders have been misunderstood and unappreciated, some have been reviled and persecuted, while still others have been actual martyrs to a cause for which they had already previously sacrificed and suffered. Our ever-faithful visiting teachers will no doubt receive this assignment of subject matter for 1946-47 with great satisfaction and enthusiasm. Like all other Latter-day Saints, they love the stories of the pioneers. With many of these, they may already be familiar. But they will probably enjoy refreshing their memories and searching for further interesting historical data. Incidents connected with the journey and labors of our peerless pioneers will awaken renewed admiration for their faith and courage, their dauntless spirit and fortitude, and will increase in their descendants and all other members of the Church, appreciation for their outstanding virtues and their marvelous, if not actually miraculous, accomplishments. It is hoped that the visiting teachers in carrying these messages to the homes will so stimulate Church members that there will be a revived interest in the lives and labors of the mighty men and women who were such important factors in the establishment of our great Western Empire; and cause Church members to seek to emulate the example set by the pioneers. Titles for the messages for the eight months follow: Lesson 1.
