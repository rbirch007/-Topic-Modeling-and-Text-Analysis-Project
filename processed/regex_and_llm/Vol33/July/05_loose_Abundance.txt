ABUNDANCE Alice Morrey Bailey I find my life is filled with friends Too willing, far, to share, Who keep me ever in their debt? With God, who answers prayer, And, from my foolish asking, Gives too much for me to bear. NOTES TO THE FIELD New Courses of Study for 1946-47 IN presenting the courses of study for 1946-47, the General Board calls to the attention of Relief Society stake and mission officers two new courses which are being offered for optional use. The course on "Sewing" is intended for study on work meeting day by any ward or branch Relief Society, all or any part of whose members desire to learn the fundamentals of sewing. Such a course is offered in order to give every member of Relief Society an opportunity to learn how to sew, under helpful supervision. It is left optional with the individual ward or branch whether or not to undertake such a study, and also to set the time on work meeting day when the course is to be presented. In addition to the value which will accrue to individual Relief Society members from such a course, it is the hope of the General Board that the "Sewing" lessons will improve the styling, sizing, and sewing of clothing for the Church Welfare assignments. It should be kept in mind that the first responsibility for sewing to be done on work meeting day is to complete the Church Welfare budget assignment. This "Sewing" course should not in any way interfere with necessary Welfare or Relief Society sewing, = members who do not desire to participate in the "Sewing" course should not be asked to refrain from other sewing during the period of time devoted to the development of the monthly lesson on "Sewing." Wards and branches which adopt this course of study for use on work meeting day will offer to Latter-day Saint women a service which is fundamental to the responsibility of Relief Society; namely, to aid the women of the Church in improving their homemaking skills. By becoming proficient in the art of sewing, Relief Society members will prepare themselves to make clothing for their own families. The course "The Gospel as a Way of Life" is presented for optional use in stakes and missions which desire to study these lessons in place of the literature course "America as Revealed in Its Literature." The final decision as to which course a particular branch or ward will study, will rest with the respective Relief Society stake president or mission Relief Society president in consultation with the ward or branch Relief Society president. For further information in regard to these and the rest of the educational courses for 1946-47, see "Lesson Department" pages 472 to 504 in this issue of the Magazine.
