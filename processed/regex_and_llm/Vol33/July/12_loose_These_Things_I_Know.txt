These things I know: that night will follow day, And bitter winter means a brighter May; That rain and sunshine lend a bud new life, And peace is Sweeter after days of strife. This, too, I know: love never really dies, his memories are mirrored in the skies; Margaret C. Pickering General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes from the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104.

Sister Ross explains, "We have earnestly tned to follow the admonition 'He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none' (Luke 3:11). Since most of the women in our Society have jobs outside their homes, we feel that we have had unusual success in our charitable efforts. There are only five families who live here permanently. The other members of our group are university students who stay with us a year or so. Their presence enriches our experiences but their departure leaves us desolated until new students come and are affiliated with " us.
