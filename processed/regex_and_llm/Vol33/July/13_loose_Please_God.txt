PLEASE, GOD Edna S. Dustin Let me not be a teen-age travesty Holding tenaciously to youth. Instead, Let me relinquish those years graciously And hold with pride my platinum coiffured head, With tendril faith still shining in my eyes, With tip-toe eagerness, but feet well shod; Let me untie the ribbons of each day's surprise And leave my outgrown years to youth, dear God.
