Notes on the Authors of the Lessons Leone G. Layton Member, Relief Society General Board In answer to numerous requests from readers of the Magazine, the following information concerning the writers of Relief Society lessons for 1946-47 is presented: LDER HOWARD R. DRIGGS has contributed from the richness of his active mind and the wealth of long scholastic training to the preparation of the Relief Society literature lessons of the past few years: "The Bible as Literature"; "(New Testament Literature"; and the present course, "America as Revealed in Its Literature." He has used no textbook for these courses, because, in writing them, he has pioneered the way, keeping in mind the particular needs and interests of Latter-day Saint women. Born in Pleasant Grove, the son of Benjamin W. And Rosalia Cox Driggs, Elder Driggs pays tribute to the influence of such pioneer teachers as William M. Stewart, Augusta Winters Grant, and Rose Brown Hayes. After his graduation from Brigham Young University, Howard R. Driggs began his teaching career in Pleasant Grove. Later, he graduated from the University of Utah in the same class with President David O. McKay, and that same year he became instructor in English at the Branch Normal School at Cedar City. After attending the University of Chicago, he became instructor, and, later, professor of English at. The. University of Utah. He held the same position in New York University, from which institution he received his Ph. D. Degree, and where he is now professor emeritus of English. Elder Driggs has always been active in the Church, serving as a president of the Mutual Improvement Association, a Sunday School superintendent, stake board member, president of the Manhattan (New York) Branch, and member of the New York Stake high council. For many years he has been a member of the Deseret Sunday School Union Board. Elder Driggs has also served as president of the Library-Gymnasium Commission of Utah, and is now president of the Pioneer Trails Association and the Horace Mann League of the United States. He has written more than thirty books, mainly on English and the story of America's making. His latest book, now being published, is The Master's Art? An Activity Course in Gospel Teaching. ELDER H. WAYNE DRIGGS, the son of Howard R. Driggs and Eva May Frampton Driggs, is a man of many talents, interests, and accomplishments. His devoted and meticulous study of the history of Page 469 470 the Church has eminently qualified him to prepare the course "Church History" for 1944-1947. He is also the author of "Stories From the Book of Mormon," 1943-1944. Elder Driggs has studied at Columbia and New York universities, and holds the degree of doctor of philosophy. He has taught English and sociology in junior and senior high schools in Utah and New Jersey, and has been a professor of education at New York University, professor of English and director of English education at Brigham Young University, head of the department of English at New York State Teacher's College, and is at present director of the Branch Agricultural College at Cedar City, Utah. Elder Driggs has always been active in the church, and has generously contributed his talents in the field of writing. His pageant ? America's Witness of Christ ? was produced each summer from 1937 to 1941 on the Hill Cumorah before thousands of people. His Dramatic Approach to Teaching contains suggestions which have been highly praised by educators throughout the country. Elder Driggs is also a contributor to many educational journals. He is a member of the Horace Mann League and many other scholastic and honorary organizations. Elder Driggs owns and manages a fourteen-acre farm in Pleasant Grove, Utah, and with his wife, Susan Elizabeth Swenson Driggs, and their four sons, makes an enjoyable hobby of farming. FELDER T. EDGAR LYON, author of the Optional Lessons in Lieu of Literature, 1946-47?"The Gospel as a Way of Life" and author of ""The Restored Gospel Dispensation," 1941-1942, is an experienced teacher and a devoted missionary, and has a rich background from which to draw material. His many years of preaching the gospel in foreign countries and his inspiring instruction in the Latter-day Saint seminaries have broadened his outlook and increased his appreciation for the ideals of the Church. Brother Lyon was bom in Salt Lake City, the son of David R. And Mary C. Lyon. He attended the Latter-day Saint High School and was graduated from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree. He also studied at Bingham Young University, the University of California, and received his master's degree from the University of Chicago. He has taught in Rigby (Idaho) High School, the Midway (Idaho) Seminary, Ricks College, and the Salt Lake City Institute of Religion. He has also served as a Sunday School and Mutual Improvement Association teacher, and is at present a member of the high council of East Mill Creek Stake (Utah). Brother Lyon served as a missionary in the Netherlands, and, before returning home, traveled in Europe, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey. In 1933, he was called, with his wife, Hermana Forsberg Lyon, to return to the Netherlands and preside over that mission. Two of their six sons, twins, were born in Rotterdam. Relief Society women will enjoy the rare spiritual quality of Brother Lyon's lessons, and the breadth of his understanding and enthusiasm will be an inspiration to them. NOTES ON THE AUTHORS OF THE LESSONS ISTER AMY BROWN LYMAN, author of the visiting teachers' messages for 1946 - 47: "Our Pioneer Heritage: Pioneer Virtues," needs no introduction to the women of Relief Society, for she has worked with them for many years. Called to the General Board in 19009, she has served as a Board member, assistant general secretary, general secretary, general secretary-treasurer, first counselor in the general presidency, and as general president. She has seen the organization grow in scope and influence, and has been instrumental in directing that growth. Through her desire to render broader service to the Society, Sister Lyman has taken special training in social welfare work and she has given years of service in this field, receiving national and international recognition for her outstanding achievements. Active in civic welfare, Amy Lyman has been a member of the House of Representatives in the Utah State Legislature, and has served on numerous committees devoted to the social betterment of humanity. From her wide experience and 471 extensive travel, she has gathered many rich treasures of thought and a fund of interesting stories about famous people with whom she has been privileged to associate. In her childhood home, many of the early pioneers visited with her parents, John Brown, who led the Mississippi saints to Pueblo in 1846, and Margaret Zimmerman Brown. From them she heard many inspiring stories of Church history. Sister Lyman has always been a champion of the visiting teachers' program of the Relief Society. She understands its purposes and is aware of the great possibilities for good within it. We are sure that the visiting teachers will enjoy carrying the messages prepared by Sister Lyman into the homes of the Latter-day Saints.
