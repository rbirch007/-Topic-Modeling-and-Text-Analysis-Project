ONLY THE BELIEVER Dorothy J. Roberts How vast were the dreams that raised a temple spire Above the bitter sage of wilderness; How strong were driven hearts that did not tire And yield the coming generations less Of majesty.... Rock-hewn and poplar-lined, How wise to lay the highways broad and straight For even journeying by foot and mind. How far their sight an iron festooned gate, For unborn keepers of the dynasty, Arches their story and a city street. How true their vision, that a progeny Find wisdom, and with lips and hands repeat The prayer once kindled by celestial fire? The sculptured temple of their souls' desire. Never the cynic left a dream fulfilled, Graceful and granite in the atmosphere; But, moved by vision, the believer willed His calloused palm to chisel rock and year Into the image of his noblest dream; Only the dreamer carves its counterpart, A pointed steeple, with a silver seam Edging the pattern taken from his heart; Only the bearer of a flame of faith Etches his vision on the rough terrain. Never the skeptic leaves his futile breath Monumented over a conquered plain; Only the believer, with a dream held fast, Utters a mortared message from the past. The Cover: "Sea Gulls Over the Valley" Photograph by T. J. Howells, M. D. VOL. 33, NO. 7 JULY 1946 " HOLLYHOcks" From a Photograph by Grace O. Tuttle
