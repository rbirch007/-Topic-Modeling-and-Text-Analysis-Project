Rag Rug Weaving in Emigration Stake, Salt Lake City Lillie C. Adams President, Emigration Stake Relief Society This account of Tug weaving as carried out in Emigration Stake is typical of that activity in other stakes having a rug Weaving assignment as part of their Church Wel. Fare budget for 1946. THE Welfare assignment given Jl Emigration Stake Relief Society in January, included the weaving of 240 rag rugs. This was an innovation, a new experience. For this reason it seemed to us a rather difficult assignment. However, if we recall the achievements of our pioneer mothers, we will always be spurred on to enter into new fields of activity, ' In the accomplishment of any of our Welfare projects, the first question to be asked is, "Is there a need?" The next question may well be, "Does the Lord require it at our hands?" These two questions in regard to rug weaving were answered in the affirmative, because our Prophets today, led by God, have asked us to support wholeheartedly the Welfare Plan. Another requisite for the accomplishment of a project should be a prayerful attitude. Our prayers should be: "Father, we are willing to work. Show us the way, for we know the light comes to all who earnestly seek thee." We can be assured of his supporting and sustaining influence, for have we not read in I Nephi 3:7 I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. Abraham Lincoln believed that it took both faith and works for any worthwhile accomplishment, for he said, "I pray as though all depended upon God, but I work as though everything depended upon myself." Now, may we tell you the procedure we followed in accomplishing our project of Tag Tug weaving? To locate a loom was the first essential. Through telephoning the Relief Society ward Presidents of the stake, we learned that a woman in one of the wards would rent us her loom. She was asked if she would Weave our rugs, but, fortunately for our development, she said that she was not able to do so on account of ill health, but would teach us the art. She proved to be a considerate, competent, and patient teacher. The next step was to find a place in which to set up the loom. The bishop of one of the wards kindly consented to have it placed in the Relief Society room of his ward. The afternoon the loom was set up and the warp put on, two rugs were woven. Eight pounds of tags had already been sewed, which made it Possible to weave the two Tugs. Page 457  SISTER ETHEL L. GOATES OF THE THIRTEENTH WARD, EMIGRATION STAKE, AT THE LOOM That which is tangible intensifies interest, so these two rag rugs were taken to each ward to show what could be done. The next step was to find a sufficient supply of rags to use in the weaving of the rugs. Some of the bishops announced in the Sunday evening services that the Welfare Program required the collection of rags for rugs. The tags just rolled in on the following Tuesday which was Relief Society work meeting. Some of the brethren, even, carried sacks of rags to the Relief Society room to increase the supply. That very day the rooms were filled with busy women, tearing, cutting, and sewing rags. Those who could not see well enough to sew, wound into balls the rags which were already sewed, or cut or tore more rags. It required 4 pounds of sewed rags for each rug to measure 27x54 inches. It was deemed advisable to sew at least half the required weight of tags to fill a ward assignment before beginning to weave. As it took 160 pounds of rags to make forty rugs, therefore eighty pounds of rags were needed before beginning to weave, and the remaining half was sewed while the first part of the weaving progressed. The proper width to tear the rags depended upon the weight of the material. Thin rags torn about two inches wide, when twisted, rolled up to the size of a lead pencil. When sewing, the right side was placed to RUG WEAVING IN EMIGRATION STAKE the right side of the material, then the material was folded double be. Fore making the seam, and sewed. In order to save thread, the thread between the seams was not cut. This method enclosed the seams so that 0 Taw edges were left, and a smooth- 'T, neater rug was made. Before have no definite pattern, select Tags of colors which will blend harmoniously. Plain colors may be used for the center and the ends of the Tug may be bordered with Stripes of different colors. The pattern to be definitely planned and laid out before the Weaving is begun, f six or more women in a ward learn thoroughly the art of Weaving, struct another group of three or four women, thus eliminating the unequal task of having only a few participating. In each ward, select as many mechanically minded women as possible for the work of weaving, as difficulties do arise, and a little mechanical skill may be necessary for repairing the machine. Have a hammer, a pair of pliers, and some nails on hand. 459 It is important, when threading the machine, that as many observe the operation as Possible, because, when weaving, the warp may break. These women will then know how Manner similar is wound on a spool. Four of our wards have completed their rag Tug Weaving assignments and have handed in the Tugs at the Salt Lake Regional storehouse. Two themselves, and by so doing they can use? up materials that might otherwise be wasted and bring useful and beautiful articles into their homes, Through love, loyalty, diligence, C0-operation, consideration, and good works, our wonderful women of Emigration Stake have faithfully fulfilled their Tag rug assignments.
