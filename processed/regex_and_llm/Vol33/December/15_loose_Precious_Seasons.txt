PRECIOUS SEASONS Thelma Ireland Spring makes me think of iron, Plowed earth so rich and brown, While summer is more golden, Grain fields like yellow down. And Autumn is like copper, That Jack Frost changed one night, But Winter is like platinum, So brittle, hard, and white. Fach season has its metal, Fach valuable and dear, So we should value every day And every precious year. LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 22 The Welfare Plan Initiated Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 Objective: To show how the Lord is helping his saints to face the problems of our day. INNER spiritual strength comes often through suffering. To be called upon to share enriches the soul. The Lord would have his people experience the joys of the greater love known through service to others. From the very beginning, the restored Church of our day has been forced through persecution and hardship into the close bonds of brotherhood. From the early days of the Church in New York, across the rolling hills of Ohio, on to the level prairies of the Mississippi, and thence to the mountains of the great West, the saints have been forced to share alike in joys and sorrows. Poor in material goods and the promise of great worldly wealth, the pioneers of Utah learned to seek the inner joys of the spirit which God gives to his people. No man can understand these promptings of the heart who has not first complied with the gospel principles. Only these signs shall follow them that believe and enter in at the straight and narrow gate. Quietly, but effectively forward have moved the Lord's people, until today they number their strength by the thousands. Their roots are deep. Winds of Page 844 adversity have only anchored them more firmly, and now, amid the storms that rage at home and abroad, may be seen the wisdom of God in keeping his people one. The world will never fully understand the Church Welfare Plan, which had its beginning in August of 1933, with public announcement by the First Presidency at April conference 1936, until it can more fully accept the Lord's way of caring for those in need: Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world (James 1:27). It is the spiritual value of this present plan that is at the basis of its operation. The passage, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," remembered most as a New Testament quotation, is God's will as recorded first in the Old Testament (Lev. 19:18). Men must learn these unchanging truths if they would honestly care for their less fortunate brothers. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the enduring values of the Lord's will have ever been taught. Saints humbly trust in his unfailing promises and strive to receive his word. LESSON DEPARTMENT To them, the heavens are not closed. God still speaks through his properly ordained servants today as of old. 'These facts must be kept in mind if one would truly understand the genius of the present Welfare Plan of the Church. Based, then, upon the will of the Lord, the Latter-day Saints take literally his express will as follows: first, they believe that it is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35); and second, they have learned his command to labor. From Sinai came the words, "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work... Thou shalt not steal... Thou shalt not covet..." Ex. 20::9, 15,17). Said President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.: Thus the Divine commands to the Church and the directions of its leaders to the people, require as a fundamental principle of their religion that Church members not in distress shall care for the needy widow and orphan, and for the poor, and that these latter shall not lay their hands on other men's goods, they shall not be greedy or covetous, they shall not be idlers, and the physically fit shall work for what they get. No exception has been made to these commands, and no person has been taken out from under them. The Church vigorously decries idleness. Industry, economy, and thrift are extolled. Deceit, avarice, dishonesty, lying, greed, graft are condemned. Honesty, truthfulness, sobriety, willingness to give, love for fellowmen, sympathy for woe, misery, and want, service to and for others, are urged to the point of command. These are the reasons for setting up the Church Welfare Plan; they are the principles underlying it. We claim no monopoly on the virtues which have made our achievements possible. These virtues have been the common heritage of every pioneer out-thrusting in America. Save perhaps in degree, our experience 845 has been the experience of all the pioneers of Western America. None were subsidized, none had easy money, none either asked for or received, government gratuities. Had they waited for these, indeed had they got them, America would never have been built. Some justify our present economic course by saying, 'times have changed." So they have, but character-building has not. The laws of righteousness and progress are eternal. 'There is no escape from them, either for the individual or for the nation. An uncorrupted citizenry builds a great State; no State ever built an uncorrupted citizenry. No man is politically free who depends upon the State for his sustenance. A planned and subsidized economy beats down initiative, wipes out industry, destroys character, and prostitutes the electorate. I repeat In view of all these considerations, the Church has felt that in setting up its Welfare Plan, it was not only meeting its prescribed duty as a Church to its members, but was performing a duty of patriotism to our country ("Church Welfare Program, A Discussion," by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Estes Park, Colorado, June 20, 1939, pp. 5, 6, 7, 8). Over thirteen years have passed since the present Welfare Plan of the Church had its beginning. It was started in 1933, with public announcement by the First Presidency at the general conference, April 1936. 'The worst depression ever to grip the world then threatened to engulf thousands. Sensing the effect this suffering would have, not only upon the physical well-being of the saints, but also what the enslavement of temporary jobs and the dole would bring, the General Authorities of the Church sought the Lord's will as it had been given and envisioned a timely plan that would be "a very present help in trouble" (Psalms 46:1). It seemed then to many who were called to lay in a year's supply of food and clothing that there might be undue alarm for giving such instructions. Quietly, however, the organization of the Priesthood in the wards and stakes was marshalled. The bishop, as father of the ward, called his counselors and clerk and began a closer check up of suffering and unemployed among his families. The ward teachers brought in upon new card forms, information which would help to keep in constant touch with each ward member. Relief Society sisters stimulated again the pioneer virtues of their grandparents, preserved foodstuffs, prepared clothing, and established sewing and cooking centers where larger groups could learn and encourage one another in the arts of industry and thrift. Household budgets were studied and prepared, the fainthearted were given encouragement, despair and distress were turned to hope and faith. From the small towns to the crowded cities, saints, often slow at first to comprehend, finally respond. Ed to the call of the Church. A new security developed. There was strength in unity, and problems which seemed hard in the dark days of want grew less, as members accepted the role of being their brothers' keepers. Today, the objectives of the Church Welfare Plan, as outlined in the L. D. S. Church: Welfare Handbook of Instructions, indicate the wisdom and inspiration which brought this much-needed help to the Church. Truly a people cannot perish with such divine vision: OBJECTIVES: The Church Welfare Plan is a program designed to relieve distress among Church members who may be in need; to strengthen the economic condition of all who participate by utilizing surpluses of time, talents, effort and substance, and to promote the general welfare of the Church members at large. Its detailed objectives include the following: 1. That no member of the Church shall want for sustenance. 2. That needed assistance be rendered in times of sickness, accident, death, or other distress to all for whom the Church is responsible. 3. That whenever and wherever worthy employable members are unable to find gainful employment sufficient for their needs, they shall be provided an opportunity to work on a welfare project. 4. That any person who receives welfare assistance, unless unemployable, shall work in the Program. 5- That benefits received for such work be mainly in terms of welfare produced food and commodities, supplemented by other supplies and cash if necessary, the total amount of which shall be based on the needs of the family unit rather than on a fixed compensation per unit of time. There may be some exceptions to this general rule where specific amounts of cash and commodities are given for service rendered. But even in these cases, where such fixed earnings are not sufficient for the needs of the family they may be supplemented by additional commodities from a bishops' storehouse. 6. That the terms "dole" and "charity," as generally understood, have no place in this program. Worthy members who, through age or other disability, are incapable of working in the Program, and who have no other logical means of support, shall be sustained by their respective Church communities from the resources of the Welfare Plan, not as charity but in recognition of their faithful support and services to the Church. 7. That families that are closely associated as neighbors, or through quorum, ward or other Church organizational activities, be encouraged to form small productive groups for co-operatively helping each other to plant and harvest crops, can, process and store foods, or carry out other projects for their mutual advantage and well-being.  LESSON DEPARTMENT Such activities are to be carried on separate and apart from the bishops' storehouse program in many localities. Welfare central, equipment and supplies are made available to those carrying out of such projects.
SCOPE: The Welfare Plan is Church wide, reaching to every Latter-day Saint ward and branch in the stakes of the Church. In the missions, welfare work is limited to an effort to solve local problems.
PARTICIPANTS may potentially comprise all members of the Church. Those who are in need of sustenance, relief of distress, or rehabilitation may participate on the receiving end, at the same time being expected to contribute their own time, talents and substance toward their own support. Others are urged to participate on the giving end�to give part of their energy, produce or finances to the general pool for the common good. All members have an opportunity to join with their neighbors and associates in carrying on worthwhile projects for their mutual benefit and blessing.
WORKERS may be classified as:
1. Those who, regardless of circumstances, are provided employment on a welfare project and in return have their needs supplied from the bishops' storehouses.
2. Those who donate part of their time and energy towards the production of food and other commodities for the benefit of the program as a whole, but who themselves receive no direct benefit or compensation for such services.
3. Those who are employed on a part or full time basis to be supervisors or key workers.
4. Those who are called to direct the program, whether in general capacities, regional, stake or ward.
FUNCTIONS: In order to reach the objectives of the Welfare Plan with any degree of completeness, there must be a clear conception of the necessary functions of the Welfare organization.
These basic functions are:
1. To determine the needs of the people.
2. To gather needed control commodities and commodity contributions.
3. To render needed assistance and to provide employment through work projects.
4. To manage the storage and distribution of commodities.
5. To meet the physical needs of ward members requiring assistance.
6. To promote Welfare work in Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood units.
7. To guide agricultural and other rehabilitation.
8. To provide hospitalization for Church cases. (L. D. S. Church Welfare Handbook of Instructions, pp. 7-10.)
Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion
With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word," which has been written for our life in this day.
There are but a few active Church members today who have not, in part at least, learned the workings of the Church Welfare plan either through adolescent lessons, Melchizedek Priesthood quorum instruction on Latter-day Saint Church Welfare, or have had complete or outlining the operation of this plan. A copy of this pamphlet should be at hand during the class discussion of this lesson. For the best discussion of the period let us center upon the spiritual outcomes of this plan as these may be discussed from the questions and readings that follow.
1. Who may fall under the condemnation of the Lord given in the passage? Read Doc. and Cov. 56:16-20.
2. On April 23, 1832, in Independence, Missouri, the Prophet was given a revelation as he sat in council with his brethren. Read what the Lord said on that occasion. (Doc. and Cov. 83:1. What significance has this new interpretation to the old one of "love thy neighbor" as given in this revelation?
3. The Lord would have his people seek the welfare of eternity. This, he said, could not be done with eyes full of greediness. (Doc. and Cov. 68:25-32). Why not? What were his commands concerning the sharing of one's properties? (Read Doc. and Cov. 42:30-31; 104:11-18.)

Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 6?Self-Reliance President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 Objective: 'To show that the pioneers were resourceful, creative, and self-reliant. NE of the distinctive differences between the first settlers of Utah and other early settlers in Western America was that the Latter-day Saint colonizers came from a larger number of different localities than did those of any other group. There were among them representatives from practically every state in the Union, from Canada, and from several European countries. 'Then, too, among the Latter-day Saints there were farmers, tradesmen, factory workers, teachers, physicians, clerks, etc. This variation in background, training, and experience was a great advantage to these colonists as individuals as it was also to the communities as a whole. It resulted in greater vision, a broader viewpoint, and added to their efficiency in planning and in carrying out their plans successfully. It has often been said that necessity is the mother of invention. It might be added that necessity is also the mother of resourcefulness. And it is resourcefulness which enables people to manage well. It helps them to accomplish things. It begets self-reliance. In resourcefulness, creative ability, and_ self-reliance, the pioneers of Utah were masters of the highest order. With wisdom and foresight, Brigham Young had advised those who were planning to emigrate to Utah to bring with them choice seeds, good tools of every description, machinery not only for farming but also for spinning and weaving. All these things stood them in good stead in their efforts at community building. During the first year in Utah, there was great activity in plowing, planting, and in irrigating. The pioneers soon learned that in this desert land irrigation was a necessity. Gristmills and sawmills were soon built. A tannery for making leather for shoes and harnesses had to be constructed. Other industries were gradually established, and fortunately those were found who, because of past experience in mills, shops, factories, and mercantile establishments, were able to carry on the work required. Upon their arrival in the Valley. The pioneers lived in their wagons until they were able to cut and saw and haul logs from the canyons for the building of cabins. Later, for home building, they used adobe or bricks made of clay and dried in the sun. Cobblestones in clay and soft rocks were also used. Old-fashioned fireplaces were installed for heating and cooking. The fuel used was sage and oak brush. A few pieces  , LESSON DEPARTMENT of furniture were brought across the plains, but most of the furniture was made by the pioneers out of native wood. It consisted, in the main, of tables, cupboards, bureaus, beds, and chairs with willow seats. Dirt floors were the rule in the beginning. Later, floors made from logs flattened on one side, and not always too smooth, were used; and, finally, braided rugs and homemade carpets were added.
The attribute of self-reliance is inherent in the gospel of the Master. One should employ all his own inventiveness and exert himself to the utmost before expecting the Lord or anyone else to come to his aid. It would be well for members of the Church in this day to emulate the example of the pioneers in developing and strengthening, in themselves, the power to be found in self-reliance.

(A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)
Lesson 6�Finishing, Trimming, Collars, Bands, Hems
Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman
For Tuesday March 11, 1947
Objective: To demonstrate the use of different trimmings, and the adjusting of necklines and hems.
Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapters 8, 9, 16, 21.
Trimmings
Very often a perfectly fitted and correctly lined garment is completely spoiled by its trimmings. Study line, balance, and proportion carefully for trimmings. The decorative items of a costume should never look as if they had been fastened on the garment, but they should be blended into its very lines. (See The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter 21.)
Collars
Collar fashions change from one season to another, but the basic method never changes. The foundation is always the same, the dress neck.
The fit and shape of a dress neck govern the fit of the collar. A perfect neckline that hugs the base of the neck is most essential. A smart, comfortable collar can never be perfected on a weak foundation. Figure A illustrates how a dress neckline must fit to the base of the neck to make a proper fitting collar. Figure B illustrates a poor dress neckline which is cut too low at the back.
[Two illustrated profile drawings of women's heads showing correct (A) and incorrect (B) neckline fits]
850 To alter a poor dress neckline, recut the shoulders and the neck, if the blouse is long enough. If not, add a piece of material, as from 1-2 shown on Figure B. (See The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter 16, pp. 110-115). Hems Know the purpose of hems. 'Too many sewers think the only purpose of a hem is to dispose of, or hide, the raw edge at the bottom of a dress. A hem is a finish for the lower edge, or on other parts of a garment. All types of Hems should be even, without the slightest variation. The method of sewing in place depends on the design of the garment and the type of fabric. Some hems serve only as a finish, while others are decorative as well. The average person pulls the stitches too tight and over stitches when hemming. For the average weight material, stitches should be from 3/8 to 3/4 inches apart. The stitches should have sufficient ease to prevent an imprint of the stitch from showing on the right side of the garment. Never put a hem in silks, woolens, or fine muslin with a sewing machine. Hems in materials of these types should always be put in by hand. The usual depth of a hem for dresses and skirts is about 2 inches, unless the skirt is flared or circular, then the hem should be narrower. The fullness at the top of a circular hem, if it is made too deep, causes a bulky, heavy top, resulting in a pronounced hemline on the right side of the garment. Assignment for April: Bring the dress you have completed, ready for fasteners, and bring the type of fasteners desired. Literature America as Revealed in Its Literature Lesson 6 Carrying America Across a Continent Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 AT one time, the writer, visiting the historical museum at Portland, Oregon, was shown by its veteran custodian, George Himes, an intriguing exhibit. "This corner," said the pioneer, "has a relic from each state east of the Mississippi. Here, for example, is a clock that ticked time in Vermont; here a scythe that mowed blue grass in Kentucky; here a Franklin stove that warmed a home in Pennsylvania; and here a cradle in which a baby was rocked as its parents crossed the plains from Indiana." "That is most interesting," was the response. "Wouldn't it be fine, too, if we could show something else those pioneers carried into their great conquest of the West?" "What is that?" "Oh, I was just thinking of their high American ideals based on a spirit of true Christianity. They came to build homes, and with them schools, and churches. They came to found communities of the American pattern and spirit." "Yes, indeed, they did," agreed the pioneer, "and they even sprinkled our map with names of their old towns. Portland, for instance, is named for Portland, Maine. There are thirty-two Salems, I am told, in the United States; and I don't know how many Springfields, and Farmingtons." Here was truly a transplanting of our civilization across a continent. In the story of this great westward march of America, there is something of deeper significance than just the outward, the material aspects of pioneering. It was  
spiritual urge that, perhaps unknowingly with some individuals and groups, gave motive and  purpose to the mighty movement. Inspired by such a thought as this, Katherine Lee Bates wrote these lines in her ''America, the Beautiful": O Beautiful for pilgrim feet. Whose stern,  impassioned stress, A thoroughfare for freedom beat, Across the wilderness! America! America! God mend thine every flaw, Confirm thy soul in self-control. Thy liberty in law! One rather common, fallacious idea about the pioneers needs to be corrected. They were not, as too often portrayed in plays and pageants, just rough, uncultured, gray-haired folk. Far from it. Our westward march of America was in large part a youth movement; most of those who survived the rigors of that testing journey into the new homeland were in their early manhood and  womanhood; all were youthful in strength and spirit. Age records and achievements prove this. Further, there were many truly cultured souls and artists and real leaders among the builders of  our West. Hardships, at times, held back their finest expression, yet not altogether. Often, some poet�like our own Eliza R. Snow� would record precious thoughts in a journal, or voice inmost feelings in a lyric. Leaders, counselling the people, often rose to eloquence; and,  occasionally, as tory would be recorded portraying with artistry the life and character of the true western pioneers. A few lines from Oxteam Days, by Ezra Meeker, who, at twentytwo years of age, went with his wife and their babe along the old Oregon Trail into what is now the State of Washington, takes us into their humble home: In the cabins there was as wide variance in habits as there is in more pretentious homes today. Some of the women were careless and untidy about their housekeeping, while others believed "cleanliness is next to godliness." . . . Flower gardens soon appeared in every dooryard to enliven the homes, and spread contentment in the households. You must not think that we had no recreation and that we were a sorrowful set. There never was a happier lot of people than the hard-working pioneers and their families. We had joy and amusements as well as labor. My mind harks back to our happy home life in the little cabin in the forest � to the twilight concert of the bird songsters; to the dripping dews of the dense foliage of the trees; to the pleasant gatherings within the cabin; to the old-time music of the violin, flute, melodeon, mingled with the voices of many now hushed and hidden from us ... .No Christmas ever went by without a Christmas tree, at which the whole neighborhood joined. The Fourth of July was never passed without a celebration. We made presents for the tree if we could not buy them, and supplied the musicians, reader and orator for the celebration. Everybody had something to do, and that very fact made us all happy. In his little book of boyhood mem Overland in a Covered Wagon, Joaquin Miller, poet of the Sierras, brings to us with literary touch something of the same spirit with pictures of pioneer days. In the poem "When Little Sister Came," he says: We dwelt in the woods of the Tippecanoe, In a lone, lost cabin, with never a view Of the full day's sun for a whole year through. With strange half hints through the russet com We three were hurried one night. Next morn There was frost on the trees, and a sprinkle of snow And tracks on the ground. Through the door, And a girl baby cried and then we were four. We burst Just a touch here of the joy three pioneer lads had in welcoming a little sister to their group. The Miller home in old Indiana, and later in Oregon, was, though isolated, one of simple culture. The father was a teacher; the mother of gentle, refined spirit. Books they had good books and the joy of these was shared by the family. Later, one son caught the "gold fever' and drifted into California, where he became a poet. His love and appreciation of babes was later expressed in another of his poems, "Utah's Best Crop." In carrying America "from sea to shining sea," the pioneers exemplified their love for the simple, basic things of life. Home and children, friends and neighbors, devotion to the principles of Christianity were of first moment with the honest settlers of our great land. With these came a desire for learning and culture and true recreation. Finally, to assure these blessings, the government of the free American pattern was established in the communities and states that were developed out of the new domain. The late Senator William E. Borah pays this eloquent tribute to these nation builders who added new stars to our flag: Invading a wilderness, a region without order, a vast country without law, traveling strange paths, and adopting sometimes harsh and startling methods, nevertheless the ultimate aim was great commonwealths, a country dedicated to orderly and regulated liberty. The pioneer was not merely an adventurer seeking gold, he was an empire builder; he laid a broad and firm foundation for these great commonwealths. They are in the true sense the real monuments to the pioneer. Reference to the pioneer, however brief, would be both incomplete and unfair without special mention of the pioneer woman.... What a marvel of patience, of devotion, of indefinable charm and tenderness, even amid the roughest environments of the desert; and above all, what self-control and courage in the hour of imminent peril! Some gifted pen will sometime, I trust, pay a fitting tribute to this sublime exhibition of American womanhood. (From Introduction to Frontier Law.) At least one really artistic expression honoring the pioneer woman has come within recent years. This is from the pen of one of Utah's gifted poets, Ann Woodbury Hafen, by whose gracious permission we are privileged to present here: MY MOTHER'S HAND Today I looked upon a map of the West? my mother's hand. Flesh geography of the old frontier. In the strong blue veins that ridged the furrowed skin,. In the eddied knuckles, weathered nails, and gullied palm I saw the raw West shape a woman's hand As that hand shaped the West. A picture map deep-etched this hand that worked a hoe,  LESSON DEPARTMENT Scythed alfalfa bribes for evening milk, Carried adobes for the long-dreamed - house, Scrubbed out irrigation's mud and sweat. This steady hand that pressed the danger trigger Delivered newborn, needled shrouds, and washed the dead. Ninety beauty-hungry years, through four generations of weddings The sure hand moved, a self-willed dynamo creating Sixty stitches to a minute, twenty pieces to a quilt-block, Forty blocks to a quilt of rainbow wedding rings To warm the matings. In an Old World garden, velvet white, this hand Secreted seeds in a young bride's deepest pocket, Guarded them from hunger's blind devouring Through six thousand alien miles And fed them at last to the black volcanic ash Of the Rocky Mountains. Out of a woman's bended labor, Watered by a widow's tearful prayers, Stirred by courage of a mother's hand The sleeping land awoke to food and flowers. Flesh geography of the West I touched today. In the seamed erosions of a weathered palm I saw a nation's story carved in glory. Dynamic map of life, my mother's hand. Another poetic picture this of a pioneer father by the same artist, under the title, "Another Lincoln," printed in Mrs. Hafen's book of poems Quenched Fire, portrays the culture and beauty of life of our pioneers amid exacting hardships. Some of our authors are beginning to bring out, with artistic strokes, the inner spirit and true character of the stalwart, yet tender men and women who carried our civilization across a continent. Nowhere is all this home-building, 853 community-founding conquest of the West more plainly shown, than in the stirring story of our own pioneers. Unlike other home seekers, those true to the Latter-day Saint faith, went westward not "'on their own," nor in hastily formed, temporary groups, but as carefully organized caravans, trusting in leaders they believed to be inspired. As a result, their percentage of casualties on the dangerous trail across plains and mountains was comparatively much lower; and the colonization of the new homeland relatively of greater success. A clear, concrete picture of 'the great work of founding communities in the valleys of the mountains a region no one else wanted may be found in the book, Brigham Young, by Preston Nibley. It is an American epic of challenging interest, this story of the planting of towns throughout the arid region with practical and spiritual guidance, and with the principles of freedom exemplified in their government. Within the first decade after the arrival of the pioneer vanguard, these self-sustaining, self-governing communities had been established by our people not only over Utah, but in what is now Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, and California. More to our present purpose, the spiritual and cultural side of life was splendidly remembered in this planting. Churches, temples, schools, and even theaters were built along with homes. Religion, education, recreation all went hand in hand with industry. Authors and artists and actors were encouraged in their creative work, yet all these varied activities, it was taught, were to be infused with the spirit of the gospel if the blessings of the Lord were to be upon them. Pictures of such a God-inspired homeland stirred one youthful-spirited poet in far-off England, Charles W. Penrose, to write these lyric lines: O ye mountains high, where the clear blue sky Arches over the vales of the free, Where the pure breezes blow and the clear streamlets flow, How I've longed to your bosom to flee! O Zion! Dear Zion! Land of the free, Now my own mountain home, unto thee I have come? All my fond hopes are centered in thee. In later years, another poet, contemplating the America that might have been visioned by those who laid its foundations on the principles of freedom, wrote: O beautiful for patriot dream That sees beyond the years; Thine alabaster cities gleam Undimmed by human tears! America! America! God shed his grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood, From sea to shining seal Katherine Lee Bates All this brings us to a concluding thought which may be made clear and concrete with a simple analogy. In their westward march, the pioneers stretched the warp of true Americanism stout and taut and true "from sea to shining sea." Into that tested warp, through the years, has been woven the woof that makes the heroic, the colorful epic of our country. It is of vital concern to every American that the warp hold that it be kept stout and true? and also that there be in the woof beauty and artistry in harmony with the true spirit of America as the founding fathers and our pioneers dreamed it.
