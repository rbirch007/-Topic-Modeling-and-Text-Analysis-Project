Laying on of Hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost Elder T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, March 18, 1947 LATTER day Saint theology differs greatly from all other Christian interpretations of the Godhead, because of its teaching concerning the personalities that constitute this trinity. In regard to the Holy Ghost, our teaching is different and more positive than others. Most confessing Christians believe that the Holy Ghost is nothing more than a spirit that is part of the Eternal God, radiating from him in much the same way that light and heat are radiated from a central source of supply. Latter-day revelation has given us the true conception. Verses twenty-two and twenty-three of section 130 in the Doctrine and Covenants instruct us as follows: The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us. A man may receive the Holy Ghost, and it may descend upon him and not tarry with him. This scripture teaches specifically that the Holy Ghost is a personage separate from either the Father or the Son, being without a tangible body, yet possessed of individuality and personality, and having the ability to dwell within a mortal soul. However, this indwelling may be either temporary or permanent, according to the worthiness of the person, the needs of the person, or the manner in which it was _bestowed upon him. If bestowed according to the prescribed rules of the Church, the person receives the gift of the Holy Ghost, which should be a lasting, vital part of his life and his faith, The Prophet Joseph Smith explained this in a statement that has become a classic description of the difference between the gift of the Holy Ghost that one receives at confirmation, and the temporary descent that the Holy Ghost may make on special occasions. There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man, and it obey him; for the spirits might say unto him, as they did to the sons of Sceva: "Paul we know and Jesus we know, but 856 who are ye?" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 199). It is necessary to distinguish between the Holy Ghost and the divine spirit that is to be found everywhere on earth among mortals of all races, creeds, and colors. President Joseph F. Smith very pointedly explained this difference: It is not the Holy Ghost who in person lighteth every man who is born into the world, but it is the light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the source of intelligence, which permeates all nature, which lighteth every man and fills the immensity of space. You may call it the Spirit of God, you may call it the influence of God's intelligence, you may call it the substance of his power, no matter what it is called, it is the spirit of intelligence that permeates the universe and gives to the spirits of men understanding (Gospel Doctrine, pp. 73-74). What then, is the function of the Holy Ghost that is conferred upon us as a gift at the time of confirmation? It gives to those receiving the gift, if they are faithful, the right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost. It is also the completion of the symbolic representation of a rebirth that is part of the acceptance of the gospel of Jesus Christ. When John the Baptist appeared in the towns and villages of Judea, he preached a powerful message of repentance, calling upon the people to straighten out their crooked ways of living and bring forth the fruits of righteous living. Then, when this had been done, he urged them to accept baptism by immersion that symbolized the washing away of sins and the burial of the old, sinful self. John did not end his work with the accomplishment of the ordinance of baptism.He stressed the fact that there must still be a rebirth by the Spirit, to complete the act of regeneration to a new life. He said:. I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you whom ye know not; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.... The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.... I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost (John 1:26-33). The elderly gentleman referred to in lesson five who did not count the first forty-five years of his life, had fully caught the significance of this idea that John was preaching. Jesus told Nicodemus that unless a person were born again "of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). This idea of the rebirth to a newness of life through water baptism and the reception of the Holy Ghost became the fundamental message of the Christian Church in its public preaching. After having completed a "Bath of Regeneration," as some have called baptism, our elderly friend had had hands laid upon him. The conferring of the Holy Ghost upon him had, in his estimation, completed his rebirth as much as the entrance of his spirit into his body at physical birth had given him mortal existence. Jesus spoke of the Holy Ghost as LESSON DEPARTMENT a "Comforter." On_ several occasions he informed his apostles that, following his departure from them, they should be comforted in his absence by the Spirit that would be sent them from the presence of the Father. As the years passed and these apostles went into the world to proclaim the good tidings of the gospel, they were literally comforted by the Holy Ghost. It gave to them the comforting testimony of the reality of the cause for which they were forced to suffer and endure opposition and hardships (see Acts 2:1-4; I Cor. 2:9-16). Another function of the Holy Ghost is to lead those who receive it in paths of truth. If one lives in accordance with gospel teachings, loves his neighbor, and serves God, the guarantee is given that the Holy Ghost will be a constant companion. If this companionship is enjoyed, truth will always be discernible, and error will have no power over the mind. Evil, which is the embodiment of error, will be shunned, and good will be chosen in its place. The Savior promised his apostles that the Comforter should act as their inspirer, giving to them words to speak as occasion arose, recalling to their memory needful experiences and ideals (John 14:26). He promised it would make them equal to every occasion that might arise. Furthermore, he promised them that it would serve as the spirit of revelation, that they might speak revealed truths and give utterance to prophetic teachings. There remains yet another function of the Holy Ghost. It has the power of aiding in the acquisition of the spiritual gifts of God. We cannot all be apostles or prophets or 857 stake presidents or bishops or hold other offices of trust. But each Latter-day Saint can diligently seek to gain the promised spiritual gifts. Various passages of scripture describe them as the virtues of patience, forgiveness, humility, longsuffering, kindness, meekness, control of the tongue, pure thoughts, courage in the face of trial or disappointment, faith in the gospel and the atonement, chastity, service to fellow men and unselfishness. Without the acquisition of these qualities, the Christian character is deficient. The ordinance by which the Holy Ghost is conferred upon the individual is commonly known as "the laying on of hands," although this procedure is also used for ordinations to the Priesthood, for patriarchal blessings, and when one is set apart for a specific office or calling within the Church. Accompanying the laying on of hands by those authorized to confer the Holy Ghost, the following words are spoken: "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ receive ye the Holy Ghost." Only those bearing the Melchizedek Priesthood have authority to officiate in the laying on of hands. Scriptural evidence is available, indicating that only such authorized bestowal has been recognized. In Acts 19:1-6, there is an account that is illustrative of this necessary power. Arriving at Ephesus on his missionary travels, the Apostle Paul found a group of about twelve professing Christians, who had ?????undergone some type of baptism. Paul inquired if the Holy Ghost had been conferred upon them, to which they replied that they had never heard that there was such a thing. Paul instructed them more fully, came to the conclusion that their baptism had apparently been performed by someone who was not divinely authorized, and rebaptized them. Then he laid his hands upon them and conferred the Holy Ghost upon them, with miraculous results. The eighth chapter of Acts likewise contains evidence of the practice of the laying on of hands. A sorcerer or magician, having observed Peter and John confer the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands, offered the apostles a sum of money if they would grant him the gift to lay on hands for the bestowal of the divine power (see Acts 8:9-24). Discussion and Activity Problems 1. Name as many functions as you can that are ascribed to the Holy Ghost. 2. In what sense was the Holy Ghost that fell upon Cornelius and his associates (see Acts 10:34-48) different from the Holy Ghost that was given to you following your baptism? 3. What is the value of the Holy Ghost in our religious thinking and daily living? 4. Have a class member either read or relate the material found in the second chapter of Moroni, concerning the bestowal of the Holy Ghost by the Nephite twelve. 5. In preparation for the discussion period, stress the part that the Holy Ghost should play in the development of Christian conduct. References Smith, Pres.

Social Science The Family in the Gospel Plan Lesson 5?Importance of Religious Instruction in the Home Social Science Committee, Leone O. Jacobs, Chairman For Tuesday, March 25, 1947 RELIGION should be a part of every life. "Man does not live by bread alone." 'There are other hungers and other needs than the purely physical. Religion is as necessary to the soul as food and drink to the body. An authority on child welfare has said: What causes young people to commit crimes is the poverty of the spirit, a spiritual starvation, and we who, as a people, reared children on that stinted ration must acknowledge the error and make haste to amend it in home and school and society. Human beings are complex creatures, and the wisest of men know little about their inner selves. But of one thing, the dullest among us are certain. Man is a creature of spirit and body. One part cannot thrive without the support of the other. If either is ignored, both suffer. In the last quarter century the  LESSON DEPARTMENT spiritual growth of children has been rather neglected. We should set about remedying the matter without quibbling. President Grant has said: I have heard men and women say that they were going to let their sons and daughters grow to maturity before they sought to teach them the principles of the gospel, that they were not going to cram the gospel down them in their childhood, before they were able to comprehend it.... The Lord has said it is our duty to teach our children in their youth.... It is folly to imagine that our children will grow up with a knowledge of the gospel without teaching (Gospel Standards, page 155). Parents would not think of saying, "I will not teach my child obedience, honesty or virtue, but will wait until he is grown and let him then choose for himself whether or not he wishes to live such principles." It is just as unwise to let a child grow up bereft of religious education and expect him to acquire it later. By the time a child is grown, his character is already formed. When he is mature it is usually too late to introduce to him a new phase of life. Most likely a child who has grown up with no religious background will never choose a religion by himself. His life having developed thus far without spiritual training, he may never see a need for it later. Importance of Parental Example As in the training of children along other lines, the example set in religious training by the parents is of prime importance. It is unusual for a child to seek religion if his parents have not shown interest or activity in this regard. President Joseph F. Smith said: 859 It does not need argument to convince our minds that our children will be just about what we make them. They are born without knowledge or understanding? the most helpless creatures of the animal creation born into the world.. And the child will be largely what its environment and its parents and teachers make it (Gospel Doctrine, page 367). The Responsibility of Parents As Latter-day Saint parents, we are charged with a sacred responsibility to teach our children the gospel. From the Doctrine and Covenants 68:25, 28, we read: And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.... And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord. As President Joseph F'. Smith said: One of the most important duties devolving upon the Latter-day Saints is the proper training and rearing of their children in the faith of the gospel. The gospel is the greatest thing in all the world. There is nothing to compare with it. The possessions of this earth are of no consequence when compared with the blessings of the gospel. Naked we came into the world, and naked we will go out of the world, so far as earthly things are concerned; for we must leave them behind; but the eternal possessions which are ours through obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ do not perish (Gospel Doctrine, page 392). Parents sometimes suppose that if, they send or take their children to" Sunday School, Primary, and to the Mutual Improvement Association, they have fulfilled their obligations concerning gospel training. Far too many risk their children's spiritual guidance to chance, or to others rather than to themselves, and think that organizations suffice for religious training. Our temporal bodies would soon become emaciated, if we fed them only once a week, or twice, as some of us are in the habit of feeding our spiritual and religious bodies.... No; on the other hand, this should be done every day, and in the home, by precept, teaching and example Spend ten minutes in reading a chapter from the words of the Lord in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, before you retire, or before you go to your daily toil. Feed your spiritual selves at home, as well as in public places (Gospel Doctrine, page 377). Nothing can take the place of religious instruction in the home. Teachings of the auxiliary organizations only augment and supplement. The foundation, the groundwork, must be given in the home. Habit can be a great aid in any endeavor. People remark, "There doesn't seem to be any time for family reading or teaching. How can we find time to give our children religious training? 'They are never at home at the same time." There are two solutions to this problem. The first is: Begin teaching your children while they are still small, when they are at home the greater part of the time, and make it your first duty to be at home with them to give them what they should have. The second solution lies in appointing a regular time, most convenient to all. Fifteen minutes will perhaps be enough. Keep to the schedule. Perhaps dinner could be set a little, early and fifteen minutes immediately afterward reserved for reading. Even if every member of the family could not be in attendance every evening, they could participate most of the time. Habit is the surest assurance of success. The benefit to be derived from even a fifteen minute period of gospel study each day cannot be estimated. What to Teach What should be included in this religious instruction? President Joseph F. Smith said: It is the duty of Latter-day Saints to teach their children the truth, to bring them up in the way they should go, to teach them the first principles of the gospel, the necessity of baptism for the remission of sins, and for membership in the Church of Christ;... Necessity of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, which will lead them into all truth. Teach your children the love of God, teach them to love the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Teach them to love their fellow men, and especially to love their fellow members in the Church, that they may be true to their fellowship with the people of God. Teach them to honor the Priesthood, to honor the authority that God has bestowed upon his Church for the proper government of his Church.... Teach them that the Prophet Joseph Smith had restored to him the Priesthood that was held by Peter and James and John, who were ordained under the hands of the Savior himself.... Teach your children to respect their bishops and the teachers that come to their homes to teach them. Teach your children to respect old age, gray hairs, and feeble frames. Teach them to venerate and to hold in honorable remembrance their parents, and to help all those who are helpless and needy. Teach your children to honor the law of God and the law of the state and the law of our country. Teach them to respect and hold in honor those who are chosen by the people to stand at their head and execute justice and administer the law. Teach them to be loyal to their country, loyal to righteousness and uprightness and honor....  LESSON DEPARTMENT Children should be taught early in life that death is really a necessity as well as a blessing, and that we would not and could not be satisfied and supremely happy without it.... No explanation of death to a child's mind can anywhere be found that is more simple and convincing than is the death of our Master, connected as it is and ever must be with the glorious resurrection (Gospel Doctrine, pp. 364, 365, 366). Children should be prepared to meet the issues of life before they come face to face with them. They should be prepared for courtship, for marriage in the temple, for the duties of parenthood. Young people going to attend universities should be taught to evaluate correctly the courses of study offered them. "Latter-day Saints accept every scientific fact, but rate theories based upon the facts as human explanations of the facts, likely to change as new facts appear.... Any theory that leaves out God as a personal, purposeful Being, and accepts chance as a first cause, cannot be accepted by Latter-day Saints." (See Widtsoe's Evidences and Reconciliations, PP- 154, 155.) That which is demonstrated, we accept with joy, but vain philosophy, human theory and mere speculations of men we do not accept, nor do we adopt anything contrary to divine revelation or to good common sense, but everything that tends to right conduct, that harmonizes with sound morality and increases faith in Deity, finds favor with us, no matter where it may be found (Gospel Doctrine, page 48). Home Evenings Church authorities advise that we make a practice of having a weekly "home evening," wherein our families may get together to discuss family affairs, study the gospel and, in general, enjoy each other's society. The home has in many cases ceased to be the center of attraction as it used to be, and members of the family often have so many outside interests that they scarcely see each other. A return to a more simple routine is advisable. The successful home evening would be a stride in this direction. Here again it is wisdom to begin early. When the children are small, conditions are ideal for setting the home evening habit? There are not many demands on the time of small children, the parents have them to themselves, and the home evening can be an occasion to be anticipated. It should be planned so that it is such. Sometimes there might be group singing around the piano, retold or reread stories, appropriate for the children, and a short discussion on proper conduct and gospel teaching. This is an excellent opportunity to teach the gospel a little at a time. If the program is varied, it will have greater appeal. Family problems might be discussed, with all old enough voicing opinions. Then games might be introduced and refreshments served. Members of the family might take turns planning the program. This would give the children a feeling of importance and encourage initiative, and the one in charge of the evening should be complimented upon the success of the evening. When the children are older, the home evening should still be continued. An evening should be chosen when most members will be at home, but if one or another cannot be in attendance, the home evening should be held anyway. All will be able to be present at least on some of the evenings, and will receive great benefit from the family gatherings. Table tennis, part singing, topics of interest in world affairs, or any other activity might be introduced to foster a close association of members of the family. Part of the time, however, should be devoted to reading or discussion of gospel principles. The maxim "Where there's a will there's a way," is very applicable to the success of the home evening project. If the will to put it over is there, it can certainly be worked out satisfactorily. Any program which becomes a fixed routine is accepted. When children are grown, they will look back on the weekly home evenings as being some of their most treasured memories times of nearness and dearness to each other. Questions for Discussion 1. Of how much importance is religious training in the home? Discuss. 2. What is the fallacy in letting children grow up and then choose the religion they wish? 3. What is the responsibility of parents in regard to religious instruction? Have someone read Doctrine and Covenants 68: 25-29. 4. What part do the auxiliaries play in gospel training? 5- What constitutes a successful "home evening'? Urge Relief Society sisters to begin home evenings among their respective families. 6. Why should the home evening be inaugurated when the children are young? 7. Have members tell of happy and profitable home evenings they have experienced. 8. A short demonstration might be given of a successful home evening program. References Doctrine and Covenants, 68:25-29.
