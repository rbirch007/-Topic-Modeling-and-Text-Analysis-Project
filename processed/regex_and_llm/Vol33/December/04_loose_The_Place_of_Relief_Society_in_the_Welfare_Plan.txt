The Place of Relief Society in the Welfare Plan Elder Harold B. Lee Of the Council of the Twelve [Delivered at the officers' meeting of the general Relief Society conference, held in the Assembly Hall, Thursday morning, October 3, 1946.] T is not likely that I shall say anything new to you on this subject of the Relief Society in the Church Welfare Program, and | shall only attempt this morning to lay down a few general, broad principles that might aid you as Relief Society leaders to more clearly see your place and to fill it, in the accomplishment of that which we have been assigned to do under what has been popularly, or otherwise, known as the Church Welfare Plan. I should first like to discuss the relationship that the Relief Society organization has to the Priesthood. The Apostle Paul said to the Corinthians: Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord (I Cor. 11:11). Now, while that had reference to marriage, I would like to paraphrase that to give strength to this point: Neither the brethren of the Priesthood can succeed in the Welfare Program without the sisters of the Relief Society, nor can the Relief Society succeed without the brethren of the Priesthood. President Joseph F. Smith, who has analyzed for us this relationship, has made two very significant expressions on this subject at various times, and I read those statements: I have in mind our auxiliary organizations; What are they? Helps to the standard organizations of the Church. They are not independent. I want to say to the Young Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations, and to the Relief Society, and to the Primaries, and to the Sunday Schools... And all the rest of the organizations in the Church, that not one of them is independent of the Priesthood of the Son of God. Not any of them can exist a moment in the acceptance of the Lord when they withdraw from the voice and from the counsel of those who hold the Priesthood and preside over them. 'They are subject to the powers and authority of the Church, and they are not independent of them; nor can they exercise any rights in their organizations independently of the Priesthood and of the Church (President Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, page 479). And then he said this: We expect to see the day, if we live long enough, and if some of us do not live long enough to see it, there are others who will, when every council of the Priesthood in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will understand its duty�will assume its own responsibility, will magnify its calling and fill its place in the Church to the utmost, according to the intelligence and ability possessed by it. When that day shall come, there will not be so much necessity for work that is now being done by the auxiliary organizations because it will be done by the regular quorums of the priesthood (Gospel Doctrine, p. 199, 31d Ed; April C-R_ 1906, page 3). How much time will pass before that will take place none of us know, but until that time comes, we Page 809 must invite and expect the great body of sisters, represented in this leadership here this morning, and the other auxiliary organizations, to give assistance to the Priesthood as they are now expected to do. There will be said to you in every stake welfare meeting where our General Committee members assemble with you, there will be said in the General Welfare meeting which will be held Saturday morning in the Tabernacle, beginning at eight o'clock, some of the phases of the essential parts of the Welfare Program that I shall discuss with you here this morning for a few moments. As we see it, after ten and a half years of intensive activity, there are three essentials to an effective program in every stake of the Church if the welfare objectives are to be realized. The first essential is that there must be welfare projects conducted and developed on a permanent basis to produce the commodities adjudged necessary to take care of those who may have to be assisted. AY I be specific as to what we mean by that kind of a project. For that to be realized, our wheat must be produced on land owned and operated by a ward or Priesthood quorum or by the stake. Our beef must be procured from cattle which we pasture, and feed, and slaughter in the Welfare Program. Our milk must be obtained from cows which we own and which are fed with hav and grain which we produce, from cows which are sheltered in sheds and barns, built from lumber which we obtain in the Welfare Program, and milked by brethren who are unemployed and need assistance. And the milk that comes from those cows must be processed in milk plants and in dairies and in condenseries and churns in order to produce the milk and the cheese and the butter that we need to take care of our people. Our shoes must come from hides that we procure from the cattle that we slaughter to provide our meat. And the hides must be tanned in our own tanneries, and manufactured in our own plants which employ people who otherwise would be unemployed, or who must be trained in order to take their place in private industry. I am hoping for the day to come when we can take the raw cotton and the raw wool which we now obtain as an assignment in the Welfare Program and have that raw material spun into yarns, and that yarn woven into cloth, and then have our sisters direct the processing of that cloth we thus produce, into bedding, clothing, mattresses, and the other things we need in the Welfare Program. That is what we mean by permanent welfare projects, and until we move forward in that program to as near the hundred per cent production of our needs in the Welfare Program, we are not striking a maximum efficiency. President Wilford Woodruff made a significant statement, about fifty years ago, in an address that he delivered at the Weber Stake conference, and this is what he said: So far as temporal matters are. Concerned we have got to go to work and provide for ourselves. The day will come when�as we have been told�we shall all see the necessity of making our own shoes and clothing and raising our own' food,  RELIEF SOCIETY IN THE WELFARE PLAN and uniting together to carty out the purposes of the Lord. We will be preserved in the mountains of Israel in the day of God's judgment. I, therefore, say to you, my brethren and sisters, prepare for that which is to come ( Weber Stake Conference, Oct. 8, 1894; MS. 56:643-4)- That warning and that prophecy ought not to fall on deaf ears. NOW: where is the place of the Relief Society in the accomplishment of this essential objective? Years ago when the Welfare Program was just getting underway, Surveys were made throughout the Church of the homes where difficulty and want and distress were to be found. We found a very startling situation. In the great majority of those homes�and | would suppose ninety to ninety-five per cent, or even more�the mothers in the homes of most of those families did not know how to bake their own bread; they did not know how to remodel or remake their clothes; they did not know how to preserve fruits and vegetables, and their husbands were unskilled laborers. I want you to look at that picture, you sisters, and then ask yourselves � that kind of a home is prepared to withstand the shock of unemployment and want and distress. We discovered in this Welfare Program that we had lost many of those pioneer skills that made for independence and thrift and industry. Thank the Lord, through the guidance of wise men, we are bringing back some of those old skills; we are learning how to make rugs, and, as I go throughout the Church, I find that after you have made your, shall I say, arduous assignment of rugs, that you have agonized about in many cases, I find that you are finding 811 the opportunity and the materials to make a few of those extra lovely rugs to grace your own homes. It is a splendid thing, as I see, that homemade rugs that you have learned how to make yourselves in the Welfare Program, are finding a place in our homes. Breadmaking, dressmaking, food preservation�there was never a time in our lives when there was as fine 4 training program for the mothers of this Church as there is at the present time '1 those essential and fundamental skills, and may I now impress this one thought: We are failing in this Welfare Program if and when we have mothers of homes receiving assistance who are able bodied and can do so, when they are not brought into the production assignments, in sewing and breadmaking and tug weaving. You Sisters must see to it that all able bodied persons, whose home conditions permit them to do so, brought in to help to be producers in that program from which they receive sustenance. We fail in that, and we fail in one of the prime requirements of the Welfare Program. Even though they may not be able to come to your centers, even though it may require someone being sent into their homes to teach them if they cannot come to a center, you presidents should see to it that someone teaches them, and they have work to do in their own homes where they may have to be surrounded by their own children. There is another essential in this program before we can move forward, and that is that there must be a storehouse, adequately stocked with a full supply of welfare-produced commodities, and within the reach of every bishop, and of course his Relief Society president, who is his right-hand assistant in this work. Now, where do you fit into that Program? As I go throughout the Church, I frequently ask how many presidents have seen the Food Distribution Guide, and I am startled ofttimes to find that not even the stake Relief Society president has ever seen a Food Distribution Guide. You cannot be of very effective assistance in this distribution program unless you know two things: One is that you know what foods are in the storehouse, available for distribution; and the second, that you have some comprehension of the estimated amount families of average size will require. Possession and understanding and use of that Food Distribution Guide will help to answer both questions. Without it, you are in the dark: with it, you become effective tools in the Welfare Program. Now, in order for you to give that kind of assistance, there is another thing you must know and_ understand. What are the resources that the Church has, or you might call them assets, in order to solve an individual welfare problem? How do you start to solve it? Suppose I should ask you this question at this time. Suppose that tonight a telephone call comes to the father of a family where he is at work, bringing him the distressing word that his little son has been hit with an automobile and has been rushed to the hospital, critically injured. This family is making only a very low income, just barely enough to keep the family together with food and the essentials. Now there faces the family immediately, a doctor bill, a hospital bill�how in the world are you going to handle it? I fear if I should ask you that question and have you answer it here, most of you would say: "Well, we will call on the fast offering funds." And that is not the way the Welfare Program begins, and that is where we make our error. In the first place, we start out with the individual himself. We do not move from that point until we have helped the individual to do all he can to help his own problem. Now, sentiment and our emotional sympathy might push us to other conclusions, but that is the first, and then we reach out to the immediate relatives of that family. We are losing the family solidarity, we are losing the strength that comes from family unity, when we fail to give opportunity and to help to direct a way by which immediate relatives of that family, so distressed, can come to the aid of their own. HEN, the next point we move to is to call on the storehouse for the immediate necessities. In a home like that I have just described, I want you to see the advantage of giving to that family the clothing, the food, bedding, fuel that they need for a couple of months in order to relieve the cash that they otherwise would spend to pay for that emergency hospital bill, rather than merely taking fast offerings and passing it out to them in money. In the instance of giving commodities from the storehouse, you are merely giving that family a drawing account on the commodities which they themselves have helped to produce, or that have been exchanged for that which they  RELIEF SOCIETY IN THE WELFARE PLAN helped to produce. You will find that which we receive as compensation in that indirect way for work done, will uplift and preserve the pride and help that individual to be more independent than if we start with this other and easiest course, without following the Welfare way. Now, beyond what you can do from the storehouse, then the next thing, of course, is to recommend to the bishop the use of the fast offering fund, which, he has been schooled, is to be used first from that which he provides from his own efforts and the efforts of his leaders. To that end, we must always put the gathering of fast offerings and the increasing of the fast offerings, and teaching the law of fasting, as one of the foremost parts of the Welfare Plan. In some places we have got away from that, and especially in centers where they have not many people in need. But keep in mind the law of the fast, and the increasing of fast offerings to a point where everybody is fasting from two meals and paying the full equivalent cost of those two meals as a contribution. That is one of the prime things to provide the substance to meet that. In this teaching, the Relief Society has a responsibility. Now then, following from that, we come to the rehabilitation aspects of our problems. There the Relief Society, and there the Priesthood quorums play their major part. Now what is the Relief Society's part in a rehabilitation program? Well, the first thing you do, as you visit the home of a distressed family, is to do as the bishop requires, make an analysis of the conditions of the home. I am going to talk about that in a few moments to indicate 813 why I think the Lord has given us a marvelous program in sending sisters of your attainments into such homes. OU go there to make the analysis, find out conditions, and to make an order on the storehouse, if that be necessary, and report back to your bishop the needs of the family for his approval and withdrawal from the storehouse, or from funds that he has in his Possession, if that be necessary. The second thing you do is to make certain that the home management problems of that home are studied, and that there be set in motion such direction that will help to cure the evils that are there. You must stand ready to meet home emergencies, sickness, death, and other conditions of that kind, that call upon a sisterly sympathy that ought to be expressed by the Relief Society Then, too, you must be always morale builders in this part of the program. Yours must be the uplifting hand, yours the one to steady the family situation through the emergency. As I think about this part of the program, I realize how keenly you folks need, and how you desire, a close relationship with your brethren in the Priesthood, and that brings me to the third essential before this Program can succeed. | know sometimes when | mention this, now, you feel yourselves quite helpless, but I am going to urge you to be a little more patient, a little more energetic in urging. The third is that there must be a regular weekly meeting of the Ward Welfare Committee, and there must be a monthly meeting of the Stake Welfare Committee which supervises the work of the ward. We cannot go forward without that essential meeting together. Now, sisters, I think you, in your kindly way�and keep in mind that these men who preside in the ward as bishops and Priesthood leaders are husbands and fathers; you are their wives and you have a lot of training in how to get a man into action�you can now use those tactics where necessary, kindly, but effectively, in seeing that the weekly Ward Welfare Committee meeting is held. I would like to think this: A wife in a home, a woman, is expected to be not just a scrub woman and a housekeeper, but she is expected to be an intelligent and inspired participant in the family partnership. That is just where we think the place of the Relief Society is in the Welfare Program. We do not expect that the Relief Society shall merely be scrub women and housekeepers. We expect that they shall be invited in as intelligent participants in the planning of the Welfare partnership, and without that invitation and without that opportunity, we are not going to get the solidarity that we otherwise could expect. O may we ask you sisters to redouble your efforts to see that that meeting is held. Once a month is not often enough. A meeting that is only held when it is thought it is necessary is never held. We know that. That is a pure subterfuge. This meeting, to be effective, must be held regularly and that regularity must be once a week, and the only places where the Welfare Program is moving forward as it should is in those wards where they are holding the weekly Welfare Committee meeting, properly supervised by an active Stake Welfare Committee. Now, I should like to call your attention to another thing that the Lord has said by revelation, that describes his plan. In the 104th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, I think the 14th verse, the Lord says this. And in these few words, if we understand them as I am sure the Lord wants us to understand them, we have as clearly defined in as few words the Welfare Program as anything I know. Now listen to what the Lord says: I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine. And it is my purpose to provide for my saints. Now, you listen to that when somebody tells you that we pay taxes and we ought to turn our people onto public relief. Did you hear what the Lord said? It is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine... But it must needs be done in mine own way. Not the Government's way, not some crackpot philosopher's way, but it is to be done in the Lord's way: And behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints. Now, get the significance of this one statement: That the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low. Now, that is the plan. I am going to speak of that for just a moment. Then the Lord goes on to say: For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves. Therefore,  RELIEF SOCIETY IN THE WELFARE PLAN if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment. 'There are your fast offerings, there is your tithing. Now, what does he mean by this phrase? His way is, "that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low" (Doc. And Cov. 104:14-18). "Exalt," in the. Language of the dictionary, and the definition that I am sure the Lord is trying to convey means: ""To lift up with pride and joy to success." That is how we should lift the poor up, "with pride and joy to success," and how are we to do it? By the rich being made low. Now, do not mistake that word "rich." That does not always mean a man who has a lot of money. That man may be poor in money,' but he may be rich in skill. He may be rich in judgment. He may be rich in good example. He may be rich in splendid optimism, and in a lot of other qualities that are necessary. And when individual Priesthood quorum members unite themselves together, we usually find all those rare qualities necessary to lift up the needy and distressed with pride and joy to success in the accomplishment. There could not be a more perfect working of the Lord's plan than that. Now, keep in mind this further thought, that the Lord has told us time and again that the objective of all his work is spiritual. Do you remember what he said in the 29th section of the Doctrine and Covenants? Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not 815 at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created (Doc. And Cov. 29:34). Can you see that in your handling of these affairs? Do you let everything you do be with an eye single to the glory of that individual, the ultimate triumph of his spiritual over his physical? The whole purpose of the Lord in life is to so help us and direct us that at the end of our lives we are prepared for a celestial inheritance. Is not that it? Can you give every basket of food you give, can you give every service that you render with that great objective in mind? Is this the way to do it in order to help my brother or my sister to better attain and lay hold upon his celestial inheritance? That is the objective that the Lord sets. OW, if that be the objective, cannot you see how important it is that you, as the presidents of the Relief Society make such an approach that will determine in large part whether or not we succeed or whether or not we fail? Well, as I thought about this subject and worried about it in the last few weeks, realizing what a fearsome task it was to stand here and talk to you, this many sisters, I got to thinking about this thing called sympathy, and I went into the psychology books and I found a psychologist dividing sympathy into three categories. First, he said, there is the kind of sympathy that is a sort of self-pity. We go with this feeling, "My, I feel sorry for you,' which is another way of saying, "If I were in your place, I do not think I would be able to go through it." And I thought back on my _ experience and I remembered meeting a man who was dying with cancer. The doctor had told him that he could not live for another month. My companion and I walked into his sick room, and before we had a chance to say anything, he said: "Do you know, brethren, I am going to get a big club and stand it right here by my bed?" We told him that that was a rather interesting introduction to friends, and asked: "What are you going to use that club for?" He replied: "I am going to hit the next man over the head who says to me, 'I feel sorry for you.'" Now, is that the kind of sympathy that uplifts? I fear not. 66" RHERE is another kind of sympathy," the psychologist said, "that follows convention rather than tells the truth and that fails in making people face the facts by telling them the truth." Then he, to illustrate that, told about a rich woman who was lying there with all her fineries, dressed in a beautiful gown, lying there with a mysterious ailment that no one could diagnose, and one of her friends came to her on this occasion and she said: "O I wish I were with Jesus." The visitor said to her: "You have no right to be with him. Your place is to get up from this bed and take care of your husband and your children as you ought to." Oh, she did not like it, but that was the truth, and stirred by that "sympathy," that kind of sympathy, she got up from her bed and her mysterious ailment began to cure itself. I saw that in my own office over here in the distant past, and I think I can tell it without anyone knowing of whom I speak. We had someone who was very much in distress, so she thought, and needed a sum of money, rather a large sum, and she came, thinking that it might be borrowed from the Welfare Program. We had discussed the whole question. We felt it was not the proper way to apply these sacred funds that are entrusted to the Welfare Committee by the First Presidency, and so we said, "No," and I was the one who had to say "No." I learned to say "No" in more languages than I had ever known before, over there. And she became angry at first and then she cried� and that is always a weapon a woman uses on a man�but fortunately, I guess, for the Church, I could not be the only one affected, and she could not cry before all who had said "No," and, finally, she began to plead, and then she began to argue. Well, I went through a distressing hour but there sat at my side a very wise man and, finally, when she paused, he said to her: "May I tell you a story?" And he told her the story of Joseph sold into Egypt, and he said: "You remember the eleven brothers that were up there toasting their shins in Canaan! They could hear the lowing of the cattle out in the farmyard. 'There were pans of milk in the pantry and they had all they wanted to eat, and it was warm inside. Their brother was down in a dungeon in jail in Egypt, but despite all their comfort, by comparison, they were very poor indeed, because Joseph in the dungeon could walk and talk with God."  RELIEF SOCIETY IN THE WELFARE PLAN I think I have never seen a woman change so. She looked at him fora few moments as the full import of that great lesson came upon her, and she brightened her tears and said: "I know what you mean. I, too, have a way." The truth, sometimes, is the most difficult kind of sympathy to give, but ofttimes it is the most effective. Never let your sympathy be merely the conventional kind, just because you think you say what they would like to have you say, when you know that what your sympathy is saying is not the truth. But this last, and this valued kind of sympathy, is the kind that I want you to exercise, if you would be helpful to this Program, and that is the sympathy that is not merely trying to see another one's problems through your eyes, but it is the sympathy that tries to see their trouble through their eyes. It is the kind of sympathy that tries to put oneself in the place of the sufferer. I want you to think about that for a moment. I listened to one of our leaders tell me about how he approached the knotty problems that came in their council meetings, and he said: "When it gets to a point where I do not know which way to turn and what to answer, I sit for a few moments and reflect if the Master were here in our place�and this is his work�how would the Master set about it. What would be his answer to this problem? And then I begin to see how kindly he approached his tasks. I begin to see how he got into the individual hearts of his people." When I heard our leader describing his approach I thought of the 817 picture that I had seen of Jesus sitting on the seashore, teaching old Zebedee and his two sons, James and John�have you seen the beautiful painting? Old Zebedee, for fifty or more years, has only thought in one groove. He sits there as much as to say: "You try to teach me anything different than I have been thinking." James and John, his younger sons, seem to be listening more intently, but here sits the Master. He has placed his hand kindly on the forearm of this old grizzled veteran, Zebedee. The Master does not seem to be in a hurry. He has no trains to catch nor any appointments to keep. He looks like he can sit there all day and all next week, and all next month if it were necessary. It looks, from the expression on his face, that he is willing to illustrate, to put it anew, to repeat it, if necessary, in order to make it sink in. WELL that is the way. He could teach because he was seeing Zebedee's life through Zebedee's own eyes. That is why he was the perfect teacher. He was not sitting back and trying to make Zebedee see through his eyes. He was trying, as the perfect teacher, to help the learner through his own thinking. I want you, again, to see another picture where Jesus has set us a great example. He is hanged upon the cross. Cruel spikes have been driven into his hands and into his feet. A spear has been thrust in his side to hasten his death. Cruel thorns have been mashed down upon his brow. The blood is now trickling down in his eves and over his cheeks. (Continued on page 841 ) Bruce Redd McConkie Sustained a Member of First Council of Seventy Counselor Marianne C. Sharp THE BRUCE R. McCONKIE FAMILY Elder Bruce R. McConkie, new member of the First Council of Seventy, with his wife, Amelia Smith McConkie, and their children: Vivian, age six; Stanford Smith, age three; Mary Ethel, age five months; Joseph Fielding, age five. N October 6, 1946, Bruce Redd McConkie was_ sustained as a member of the First Council of Seventy, filling the vacancy caused by the death, last May, of Elder John H. Taylor. This action brings to the Council a man thirty-one years of age, one in the full vigor and power of mind and body, called to become one of the "traveling ministers unto the Gentiles first and also unto the Jews." Elder McConkie comes to this high calling richly endowed by native ability, parental training, and self-improvement. Page 818 He was reared in a house of faith where his parents, Oscar W. McConkie and Vivian Redd McConkie, taught the gospel by precept and also by daily example. Asa young boy, Bruce exhibited those traits of character that a BRUCE REDD McCONKIE Latter-day Saint teacher would wish in a student. He was a thoughtful, obedient lad of a sober disposition, faithful and true, courteous in all his actions, but ever ready to defend the truth. Even as a child, he possessed an unusual knowledge of the scriptures, and, as he has grown to full maturity, his early promise has been realized, until today he is of such a stature that the Lord, through his servants, has chosen him as one to help carry on his great work in these latter days. Brother McConkie has had thorough training and outstanding experience in his chosen profession �the law. He spent four years in the army engaged in security and intelligence work and, during those years, he was promoted from a first lieutenant to a lieutenant colonel. He comes well trained to his new calling, for he has been serving as senior president of the 340th Quorum of Seventy in Monument Park Ward of Bonneville Stake. He will receive full support in his 819 devoted wife, Amelia Smith McConkie, daughter of Elder Joseph Fielding Smith of the Quorum of the Twelve and the late Ethel Reynolds Smith. Sister McConkie's home training has been such as to give her an understanding and appreciation of the added responsibilities which, as the wife of a General Authority, will be hers in rearing her children during the times when her husband will be absent from home on his Church duties. Relief Society women will feel particularly well acquainted with the McConkie family since the mothers of both Brother and Sister McConkie served, for many years, as faithful and capable members of the Relief Society General Board. Elder McConkie assumes his new duties with a keen sense of the honor and responsibility which have come to him so early in life, and he can be relied upon to give to the Lord's work full measure, running over, of his great faith, devotion, new Church assignment from his pa
