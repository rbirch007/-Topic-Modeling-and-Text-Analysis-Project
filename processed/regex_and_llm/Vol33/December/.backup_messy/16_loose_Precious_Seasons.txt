PRECIOUS SEASONS Thelma Ireland Spring makes me think of iron, Plowed earth so rich and brown, While summer is more golden, Grain fields like yellow down. And Autumn is like copper, That Jack Frost changed one night, But Winter is like platinum, So brittle, hard, and white. Fach season has its metal, Fach valuable and dear, So we should value every day And every precious year. LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 22
