DRESSING A DOLL Maude Blixt Trone How very gay 4 little dress can be! I think that I shall bind the neck with blue, And sew some little buttons on it, too, And make a pinafore of dimity. She'd better have a little coat of fur, For Jane will want to go to church with her. And she must have a lovely party dress With lace frills and ribbons, and, I guess, Flowers for her hair. Oh, I must hurry For children's years, like little rabbits, scurry Away so fast, just barely leaving Time enough for happiness or grieving Over the dolls that come and go away. Hurry! Janie has so little time to play.
