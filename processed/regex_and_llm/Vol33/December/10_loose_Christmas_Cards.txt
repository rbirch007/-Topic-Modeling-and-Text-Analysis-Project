Christmas cards with thumb tacks to the square. This is very gay. Perhaps you have a lovely old copper tray or a bright plate. Either of these used as a background for a single candle, with a few sprigs of pine, will make a very effective arrangement. CHRISTMAS ON THE MANTEL Decorate your mantel with symbolic Christmas figurines: the Wise Men from the East, bringing gifts to the Child in the cradle. Candles and pine boughs form the background. If your fireplace is a modern one, without a mantel, pin a large bow of bright red tarlatan or silk above the grate. Attach pine cones, holly, and little bells to the bow. If you have a pet antique, such as an old clock, dress it up with greens and see how distinctive it becomes, telling the time for the holidays.
