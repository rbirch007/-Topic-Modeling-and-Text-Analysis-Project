THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 33, NO. 12 DECEMBER 1946 

THE TRAVELER Margery S. Stewart Did Mary wait beside the village inn, Grateful for shadows, sheltering and cool, And smile in answer to a small boy's smile, As he went whistling to the sun-warmed pool? Did women pause and murmur gentle things, Wondering at Mary's face, its radiant awe, Before they hurried to the shaded well, Telling the first one there to haste and draw A gourd of water for the burdened girl? Did Mary hold again, with gentle hands, The swaddling clothes so finely spun and made, Seeing her baby in their tender bands, Feeling the hour grow nigh with quickening dusk? Did she see Joseph coming, and rise up And go to meet him, glad for journey's end, Lifting in silence every mother's cup? The Cover: "Rock Canyon in Winter," Photograph by Dr. Walter P. Cottam MARY OF NAZARETH From the painting "Star of Bethlehem" by Piglhein
