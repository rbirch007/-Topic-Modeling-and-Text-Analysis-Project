Hearken to Counsel Elder Joseph Fielding Smith Of the council of the Twelve [Delivered at the officers� meeting of the general Relief Society conference, held in the Assembly Hall, Thursday morning, October 3, 1946.] I THINK that we are all very much aware of the fact that we are living in perilous times, a day of trouble, so the prophets have said, when Satan is raging in the hearts of the people, and for that reason members of the Church should be just a little more careful, a little more prayerful, a little more diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord.
Now, I will be just as brief as I can, and say a few things that I think will be of importance, and I think also, necessary.
Throughout the Church, as well as throughout the world, there is a spirit of indifference, a spirit that is not inclined to hearken to counsel, and Satan is raging to a very large extent in the hearts of many members of the Church.
In a magazine that was published here a few months ago, there appeared a very startling article calling attention to the fact that the great majority of crimes being committed today are by boys ranging from eight years up to twenty. Now, that is a very sad reflection upon our civilization, and a very sad reflection upon the homes of the people, but such a condition ought not, of course, to be found among Latter-day Saints. Our children ought to be faithful and true. They ought to be taught the principles of the Gospel; but we also discover throughout the Church and in our homes there is need for improvement. There is a lack of prayer.
I have said in stake conferences many times that we are no longer a praying people. Family prayer has practically disappeared. We are not teaching our children to pray, one of the great commandments the Lord has given us. And many of the women throughout the Church are too busy to attend to Church duties, but are given to pleasures, and neglect their children and their homes.
My attention has been called several times recently at stake conferences and within the week, to one evil practice which needs attention, and that is card playing. And I thought that it would not be amiss to say something about that along with some other things here this morning. From the time of the organization of the Church until now, all the Presidents of the Church have pleaded with the members not to play cards. Now this seems to be a fault among the sisters, perhaps, more than among the brethren, and yet the brethren are given to a very alarming extent. The report has come to me, frequently, that in our stakes the sisters will get together to play cards, notwithstanding the fact that they have been counseled so frequently against this evil, and it is an evil.

 About two weeks ago, a good sister in one of our stakes put a magazine in my hands, and it is a woman's magazine, which goes into the homes of many of our people. In that magazine, there was a very enticing article advising the parents in the home to teach their children, just as soon as they are able to be taught anything, to play cards, a most abominable thing. And I said to the sister, "Well, if I were subscribing to a magazine like that I would tell them to suspend the subscription. I would not have it.. I would not like to have a thing like that in my home." I have written down one or two statements here from President Joseph F. Smith. I have not had time, or I would have taken statements from others of the brethren. Before I read this, I will call attention, however, to this fact: That when the Mormon Battalion was ready to leave Leavenworth on their journey �I am not sure that it was not from Winter Quarters�President Brigham Young, in other advice that he gave to the Battalion, said they should not take cards with them, nor spend their time playing cards, and he called attention to the evils that result from it. NOW, I want to read you three paragraphs that I copied on this question. They are all from President Joseph F. Smith: Young people in their recreation should strive to form a love for that which will not be injurious. It is not true that only that recreation can be enjoyed that is detrimental to the body and spirit. We should train ourselves to find pleasure in that which invigorates, not stupifies and destroys the body, that which leads upward and not down, that which brightens, not dulls and stunts the intellect, that which elevates and exalts the spirit and not that which clogs and depresses it. So shall we please the Lord, enhance our own enjoyment and save ourselves and our children from impending sins, at the root of which, like the evil genius, lurks the spirit of cards and gaming. You will find that in The Improvement Era of June 1911. It is not an uncommon thing for women, young and middle aged, to spend whole afternoons and many of their evenings as well, in playing cards, thus wasting hours and days of precious time in this useless and unprofitable way. Yet those same people when approached declare they have no time to attend either Sunday School or meetings. Their Church duties are neglected for lack of time, yet they spend hours, day after day, at cards. They are thereby encouraged and become possessed of a spirit of indolence, and their minds are filled with a vile drunkenness, hallucination, charm and fascination that take possession of the habitual card player to the exclusion of all spiritual and religious feelings. Such a spirit detracts from all sacred thought or sentiment. These players at length do not quite know whether they are Jew, Gentile or Saint, and they do not care a fig. Cards are the most perfect and common instrumentalities of the gambler that have been devised, and the companionship of cards, like the companionship of most other games, is that of the gambling den and of the saloon, but cards do not stand alone in our enticement to evil. Any game that ultimately leads to questionable society, because it is the chief pleasure of such society, should be excluded from the home where innocent games cannot satisfy the required pleasures of the homie without encouraging card playing (Juvenile Instructor, September 1, 1903). HEARKEN TO COUNSEL 806 Now, I say, that it has come to my attention so frequently that J thought it would not be amiss to call the sisters' attention to it, and I think you ought to use your influence to stop it, in your wards and in your stakes, by teaching your sisters through the Relief Society and other organizations, the evils of this thing which the Lord has condemned through his servants, the prophets. The Savior said to his disciples one time when he got very much annoyed: "Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" (Luke 6:46). We raise our hands and say we will support the President of the Church and the Authorities of the Church. Are we doing it? I am speaking not of you sisters here, but I am speaking, when I say that, of the members of the Church. Now I say, these are perilous times. The Devil is raging, and there are more temptations, more avenues for sinning today, among our people, than ever before in the history of the Church. Every good thing that comes for the benefit of man, the Devil takes possession of: the radio, for instance. What a wonderful instrument it is, what a means to educate the people, and yet ninety per cent of the programs that come over the radio should not be heard at all. You can hardly ever turn one on without hearing a tobacco ad, a very alluring one, or something else of an evil nature. In the programs, many of them, that are given for entertainment, things are presented that are, well, shady; the jokes, and all these things are listened to by our young people. How can they grow up in the knowledge of the truth, in the love of the truth, with such things before them? Another thing we ought to keep our children from, and you as mothers should use your influence, is the public dance. I do not know of 807 anything which is a greater evil than the public dance, where, promiscuously, people gather, no questions asked as long as they pay their price, and out of it comes sin. Again, may I, dare I, speak about it, even to you mothers, of modern dress. It is not what the Lord has indicated he would have. He gave to the Church a law which you can find recorded in section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which he says, "Let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty the beauty of the work of thine own hands," but they are not. I am speaking of the women's dress. I do not think they dress modestly. 'This comes from the world and we partake very largely of these fashions. I suppose perhaps the women think they are pleasing the men. From my understanding, and considering the men [ associate with, they are not pleased, not at all. Men in the world may be, I do not know, but not men in the Church, Latter-day Saints. And why do we have to follow the customs and the fashions of the world? OW, there are so many other things that are evil I cannot take time to mention them, that are placed before our people today, both old and young, and I want to tell you sisters, many among us cannot help, when we see things constantly, from being influenced. All the time we have portrayed before us the advertisements of tobacco and liquor, and all kinds of ads in the magazines, that are unwholesome. In some magazines that many among us like to buy, there are pictures of scantily dressed women. Can we expect our young people to grow up very much with the spirit of the 808. Gospel in them under such conditions? I wonder if we, ourselves, are not more or less affected by it, seeing and hearing these things constantly. Now, the papers are telling us all the time that the condition throughout this nation is terrible in regard to divorce. We find it right here among our own people. There was a time when divorce was much less within the Church than it is today, but in recent years it has been increasing. Why? All of these modem sins tend to it, everything to weaken and destroy the influence of the home. People are losing the love for the home, for the family, today, and that brings upon us these divorce difficulties. And so many of our young people are not looking upon marriage as the Lord would have them look upon it. They do not realize what it means. They are willing to be married outside of the Temple. Why? Because _ their mothers, particularly so their mothers, have failed to teach them the proper kind of marriage. Fathers have failed also, but the mothers are with the children more of the time in the home. And young people born under the covenant are being married outside of the Church, or outside of the Temple, and ofttimes we see in the papers their pictures, and the parents seem to be elated over it, and so they put the pictures in the papers and advertise the fact that the marriage is to be outside the Temple. I should thing they would be ashamed. May I tell you this? In the early days of my life, occasionally my father would hold a meeting with his family, and he would talk to us. And he has told us in those meetings, time and time again, he would rather take his children to the grave and lay them away, knowing that they were in their purity and entitled to come up in the resurrection to receive the blessings of exaltation in the Kingdom of God, than to have them marry out of the Church or out of the Temple if that would deprive them of these blessings, which it would, unless they should repent. And yet a lot of our people are teaching their sons and their daughters that it does not matter. It comes to my attention that mothers are telling their daughters not to go to the Temple. When they get old then they can go to the Temple, but they do not want to go to the Temple until they get old, until their "charms," whatever that means, have disappeared. Maybe you know what that means. I do not think a woman's charms should ever disappear. I do not think age should make the difference. And so I would like to read to you just one paragraph that I wrote a long time ago, and that is all I will have time to do: Nothing is more pitiful than to see a broken, dismembered family where husband and wife have separated and children know not what to do. Sad are the stories which come to the officials in the Temples and difficult are the problems which they are asked to unravel. Parents, think of your children. Do not let petty troubles, trifling difficulties and misunderstandings come between you. Children have a right to the blessings of the sacred' union, love and happiness which belong to the family. They have an eternal claim upon their parents, and when these parents, through some foolishness, some whim or needless anger, permit themselves to be separated, the children are the great sufferers. What will the Lord (Continued on page 843)
