Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, December 1, and December 15, 1886 "For THE RIGHTS OF. THE Women of ZION; AND THE RIGHTs OF THE Women OF ALL Nations" ESSAY ON CHRISTMAS: Christmas time, of all the year, is a time of rejoicing for all Christian sects. It is a time of festivity and merrymaking, and I sometimes think that in our mirth and pleasure we are apt to forget the real and most worthy cause of joy and rejoicing�the birth of our Savior, the babe in Bethlehem, the meek and lowly Jesus, who came to this earth in the meridian of time, as it had been ordained in the courts above, before the creation of this world.... Let us try to remember the obligations we are under, that when we have finished our work on earth it may be said of us: "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of Thy Lord." �M. M. CHRISTMAS NIGHT In all this boasted land of happy homes, How many circles are complete tonight? How many round their festive firesides come Without a vacancy OF sorrow's blight? - But there will come a Christmas holiday� The glorious natal day of heaven's Son, When all the world combined will stay To give their praise to that holy One. Then every nation, people, kindred, tongue, With one accord will bow the pliant knee; And glorious praise and anthems will be sung, Whilst Gods and angels shout, "Oh, Zion's free!" E. R. Shipp HONOR TO \WHOM HONOR IS DUE: At Pima, Arizona, a pleasant and enjoyable surprise was given to Stake President of Relief Society, Wilmirth East, on Wednesday, November 17th, it being her sixty-second birthday.... About 25� of the brethren and sisters were present, among whom was President Layton, who spoke in high terms of praise of the way in which Sister East had performed her labors... Said she was truly a mother in Israel; always on hand to minister to the sick and needy, and give words of encouragement to those who were called to mourn, or to those who were inclined to stray from the path of duty. Sister East thanked all for the honor they had shown her, and hoped with the help of God to be always worthy of their love and esteem..- + EDITORIAL NOTES: Christmas preparations are being made by the merchants and shopkeepers, and the great display of holiday goods gives the city a decidedly cheerful and business like appearance. Christmas trees and holly are for sale in various parts of the town.... The large window in the Z. C. M. I. Makes a fine show in the grocery department, and Savage's Art Bazaar makes an elegant and artistic showing of books, pictures and fancy goods. - - - Dwyer has a very elaborate assortment of toys. - Pembroke has a fine variety, also, of this style of goods...-- Page 828
