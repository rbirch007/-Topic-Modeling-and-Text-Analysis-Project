MARVIN O. ASHTON On October 9, 1946, all that was mortal of Bishop Marvin O. Ashton was laid to rest in the Sunset Lawn Cemetery, Salt Lake City, Utah, attended by a vast concourse of people eager to pay tribute to the man they loved. He lived abundantly, generously, and finished superbly. In the afternoon of the last day of his life, he preached a great sermon before the general conference of the Church; and while the words scarcely ceased Page 820 A GREAT Commoner has gone. Echoing in the hearts of those who listened, he passed away. Death came in his sleep early the following morning. Three score and three years make up the span of his mortal days. His way of doing things was different, original, individualistic. Marvin Ashton was interested in widows, orphans, poor people, and boys. No better example of Christian living can be found than the record of his deeds. "He went about doing good." The philosophy of his life was made up of common sense, human kindness, generosity, and humor. He was a rare type of man� one of the common people grown great, indeed a great commoner. There are few such men. You rarely meet them, and when you do, you never forget them. People in need of help went to Bishop Ashton and he never failed them. He was a good citizen, a devoted husband, a great father, a delightful companion, a friend of youth, and a leader whom the people loved to follow. The entire Church and the community have sustained an irreparable loss in his passing. He has left behind a sweet and shining memory and sons and daughters worthy of the name they bear. Chiefest among the mourners is the wonderful woman who has walked by his side for forty years, the mother of his children. May the sweet influence that emanates from above comfort and solace her heart and the hearts of all who mourn.
