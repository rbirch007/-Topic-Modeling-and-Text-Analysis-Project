CHRISTMAS-EVE MAGIC Mary J. Morris After the lights and the balls of red and blue Are nested in silver at the Christmas tree, My heart again perfects a rendezvous That makes this magic time... Eternity. (The Christmas silhouettes upon the snow; The childish whisper; the feet upon the stairs; The smell of spices; the holly berries' glow; Accentuate a world released from cares. ) Above it all a star is standing by Until the gleams from proteges are found, And then it leads the way across the sky To shine once more on pure and holy ground. How old and yet how new this magic light Encircling hearts of youth and age tonight! Loyalty, and capabilities. Marvin Q. Ashton Elder Bryant S. Hinckley BISHOP
