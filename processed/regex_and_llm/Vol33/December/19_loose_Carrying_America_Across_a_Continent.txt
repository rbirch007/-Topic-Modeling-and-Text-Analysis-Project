Carrying America Across a Continent Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 AT one time, the writer, visiting the historical museum at Portland, Oregon, was shown by its veteran custodian, George Himes, an intriguing exhibit. "This corner," said the pioneer, "has a relic from each state east of the Mississippi. Here, for example, is a clock that ticked time in Vermont; here a scythe that mowed blue grass in Kentucky; here a Franklin stove that warmed a home in Pennsylvania; and here a cradle in which a baby was rocked as its parents crossed the plains from Indiana." "That is most interesting," was the response. "Wouldn't it be fine, too, if we could show something else those pioneers carried into their great conquest of the West?" "What is that?" "Oh, I was just thinking of their high American ideals based on a spirit of true Christianity. They came to build homes, and with them schools, and churches. They came to found communities of the American pattern and spirit." "Yes, indeed, they did," agreed the pioneer, "and they even sprinkled our map with names of their old towns. Portland, for instance, is named for Portland, Maine. There are thirty-two Salems, I am told, in the United States; and I don't know how many Springfields, and Farmingtons." Here was truly a transplanting of our civilization across a continent. In the story of this great westward march of America, there is something of deeper significance than just the outward, the material aspects of pioneering. It was  
spiritual urge that, perhaps unknowingly with some individuals and groups, gave motive and  purpose to the mighty movement. Inspired by such a thought as this, Katherine Lee Bates wrote these lines in her ''America, the Beautiful": O Beautiful for pilgrim feet. Whose stern,  impassioned stress, A thoroughfare for freedom beat, Across the wilderness! America! America! God mend thine every flaw, Confirm thy soul in self-control. Thy liberty in law! One rather common, fallacious idea about the pioneers needs to be corrected. They were not, as too often portrayed in plays and pageants, just rough, uncultured, gray-haired folk. Far from it. Our westward march of America was in large part a youth movement; most of those who survived the rigors of that testing journey into the new homeland were in their early manhood and  womanhood; all were youthful in strength and spirit. Age records and achievements prove this. Further, there were many truly cultured souls and artists and real leaders among the builders of  our West. Hardships, at times, held back their finest expression, yet not altogether. Often, some poet�like our own Eliza R. Snow� would record precious thoughts in a journal, or voice inmost feelings in a lyric. Leaders, counselling the people, often rose to eloquence; and,  occasionally, as tory would be recorded portraying with artistry the life and character of the true western pioneers. A few lines from Oxteam Days, by Ezra Meeker, who, at twentytwo years of age, went with his wife and their babe along the old Oregon Trail into what is now the State of Washington, takes us into their humble home: In the cabins there was as wide variance in habits as there is in more pretentious homes today. Some of the women were careless and untidy about their housekeeping, while others believed "cleanliness is next to godliness." . . . Flower gardens soon appeared in every dooryard to enliven the homes, and spread contentment in the households. You must not think that we had no recreation and that we were a sorrowful set. There never was a happier lot of people than the hard-working pioneers and their families. We had joy and amusements as well as labor. My mind harks back to our happy home life in the little cabin in the forest � to the twilight concert of the bird songsters; to the dripping dews of the dense foliage of the trees; to the pleasant gatherings within the cabin; to the old-time music of the violin, flute, melodeon, mingled with the voices of many now hushed and hidden from us ... .No Christmas ever went by without a Christmas tree, at which the whole neighborhood joined. The Fourth of July was never passed without a celebration. We made presents for the tree if we could not buy them, and supplied the musicians, reader and orator for the celebration. Everybody had something to do, and that very fact made us all happy. In his little book of boyhood mem Overland in a Covered Wagon, Joaquin Miller, poet of the Sierras, brings to us with literary touch something of the same spirit with pictures of pioneer days. In the poem "When Little Sister Came," he says: We dwelt in the woods of the Tippecanoe, In a lone, lost cabin, with never a view Of the full day's sun for a whole year through. With strange half hints through the russet com We three were hurried one night. Next morn There was frost on the trees, and a sprinkle of snow And tracks on the ground. Through the door, And a girl baby cried and then we were four. We burst Just a touch here of the joy three pioneer lads had in welcoming a little sister to their group. The Miller home in old Indiana, and later in Oregon, was, though isolated, one of simple culture. The father was a teacher; the mother of gentle, refined spirit. Books they had good books and the joy of these was shared by the family. Later, one son caught the "gold fever' and drifted into California, where he became a poet. His love and appreciation of babes was later expressed in another of his poems, "Utah's Best Crop." In carrying America "from sea to shining sea," the pioneers exemplified their love for the simple, basic things of life. Home and children, friends and neighbors, devotion to the principles of Christianity were of first moment with the honest settlers of our great land. With these came a desire for learning and culture and true recreation. Finally, to assure these blessings, the government of the free American pattern was established in the communities and states that were developed out of the new domain. The late Senator William E. Borah pays this eloquent tribute to these nation builders who added new stars to our flag: Invading a wilderness, a region without order, a vast country without law, traveling strange paths, and adopting sometimes harsh and startling methods, nevertheless the ultimate aim was great commonwealths, a country dedicated to orderly and regulated liberty. The pioneer was not merely an adventurer seeking gold, he was an empire builder; he laid a broad and firm foundation for these great commonwealths. They are in the true sense the real monuments to the pioneer. Reference to the pioneer, however brief, would be both incomplete and unfair without special mention of the pioneer woman.... What a marvel of patience, of devotion, of indefinable charm and tenderness, even amid the roughest environments of the desert; and above all, what self-control and courage in the hour of imminent peril! Some gifted pen will sometime, I trust, pay a fitting tribute to this sublime exhibition of American womanhood. (From Introduction to Frontier Law.) At least one really artistic expression honoring the pioneer woman has come within recent years. This is from the pen of one of Utah's gifted poets, Ann Woodbury Hafen, by whose gracious permission we are privileged to present here: MY MOTHER'S HAND Today I looked upon a map of the West? my mother's hand. Flesh geography of the old frontier. In the strong blue veins that ridged the furrowed skin,. In the eddied knuckles, weathered nails, and gullied palm I saw the raw West shape a woman's hand As that hand shaped the West. A picture map deep-etched this hand that worked a hoe,  LESSON DEPARTMENT Scythed alfalfa bribes for evening milk, Carried adobes for the long-dreamed - house, Scrubbed out irrigation's mud and sweat. This steady hand that pressed the danger trigger Delivered newborn, needled shrouds, and washed the dead. Ninety beauty-hungry years, through four generations of weddings The sure hand moved, a self-willed dynamo creating Sixty stitches to a minute, twenty pieces to a quilt-block, Forty blocks to a quilt of rainbow wedding rings To warm the matings. In an Old World garden, velvet white, this hand Secreted seeds in a young bride's deepest pocket, Guarded them from hunger's blind devouring Through six thousand alien miles And fed them at last to the black volcanic ash Of the Rocky Mountains. Out of a woman's bended labor, Watered by a widow's tearful prayers, Stirred by courage of a mother's hand The sleeping land awoke to food and flowers. Flesh geography of the West I touched today. In the seamed erosions of a weathered palm I saw a nation's story carved in glory. Dynamic map of life, my mother's hand. Another poetic picture this of a pioneer father by the same artist, under the title, "Another Lincoln," printed in Mrs. Hafen's book of poems Quenched Fire, portrays the culture and beauty of life of our pioneers amid exacting hardships. Some of our authors are beginning to bring out, with artistic strokes, the inner spirit and true character of the stalwart, yet tender men and women who carried our civilization across a continent. Nowhere is all this home-building, 853 community-founding conquest of the West more plainly shown, than in the stirring story of our own pioneers. Unlike other home seekers, those true to the Latter-day Saint faith, went westward not "'on their own," nor in hastily formed, temporary groups, but as carefully organized caravans, trusting in leaders they believed to be inspired. As a result, their percentage of casualties on the dangerous trail across plains and mountains was comparatively much lower; and the colonization of the new homeland relatively of greater success. A clear, concrete picture of 'the great work of founding communities in the valleys of the mountains a region no one else wanted may be found in the book, Brigham Young, by Preston Nibley. It is an American epic of challenging interest, this story of the planting of towns throughout the arid region with practical and spiritual guidance, and with the principles of freedom exemplified in their government. Within the first decade after the arrival of the pioneer vanguard, these self-sustaining, self-governing communities had been established by our people not only over Utah, but in what is now Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, and California. More to our present purpose, the spiritual and cultural side of life was splendidly remembered in this planting. Churches, temples, schools, and even theaters were built along with homes. Religion, education, recreation all went hand in hand with industry. Authors and artists and actors were encouraged in their creative work, yet all these varied activities, it was taught, were to be infused with the spirit of the gospel if the blessings of the Lord were to be upon them. Pictures of such a God-inspired homeland stirred one youthful-spirited poet in far-off England, Charles W. Penrose, to write these lyric lines: O ye mountains high, where the clear blue sky Arches over the vales of the free, Where the pure breezes blow and the clear streamlets flow, How I've longed to your bosom to flee! O Zion! Dear Zion! Land of the free, Now my own mountain home, unto thee I have come? All my fond hopes are centered in thee. In later years, another poet, contemplating the America that might have been visioned by those who laid its foundations on the principles of freedom, wrote: O beautiful for patriot dream That sees beyond the years; Thine alabaster cities gleam Undimmed by human tears! America! America! God shed his grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood, From sea to shining seal Katherine Lee Bates All this brings us to a concluding thought which may be made clear and concrete with a simple analogy. In their westward march, the pioneers stretched the warp of true Americanism stout and taut and true "from sea to shining sea." Into that tested warp, through the years, has been woven the woof that makes the heroic, the colorful epic of our country. It is of vital concern to every American that the warp hold that it be kept stout and true? and also that there be in the woof beauty and artistry in harmony with the true spirit of America as the founding fathers and our pioneers dreamed it.
