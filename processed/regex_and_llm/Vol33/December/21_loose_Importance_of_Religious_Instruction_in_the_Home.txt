Importance of Religious Instruction in the Home Social Science Committee, Leone O. Jacobs, Chairman For Tuesday, March 25, 1947 RELIGION should be a part of every life. "Man does not live by bread alone." 'There are other hungers and other needs than the purely physical. Religion is as necessary to the soul as food and drink to the body. An authority on child welfare has said: What causes young people to commit crimes is the poverty of the spirit, a spiritual starvation, and we who, as a people, reared children on that stinted ration must acknowledge the error and make haste to amend it in home and school and society. Human beings are complex creatures, and the wisest of men know little about their inner selves. But of one thing, the dullest among us are certain. Man is a creature of spirit and body. One part cannot thrive without the support of the other. If either is ignored, both suffer. In the last quarter century the  LESSON DEPARTMENT spiritual growth of children has been rather neglected. We should set about remedying the matter without quibbling. President Grant has said: I have heard men and women say that they were going to let their sons and daughters grow to maturity before they sought to teach them the principles of the gospel, that they were not going to cram the gospel down them in their childhood, before they were able to comprehend it.... The Lord has said it is our duty to teach our children in their youth.... It is folly to imagine that our children will grow up with a knowledge of the gospel without teaching (Gospel Standards, page 155). Parents would not think of saying, "I will not teach my child obedience, honesty or virtue, but will wait until he is grown and let him then choose for himself whether or not he wishes to live such principles." It is just as unwise to let a child grow up bereft of religious education and expect him to acquire it later. By the time a child is grown, his character is already formed. When he is mature it is usually too late to introduce to him a new phase of life. Most likely a child who has grown up with no religious background will never choose a religion by himself. His life having developed thus far without spiritual training, he may never see a need for it later. Importance of Parental Example As in the training of children along other lines, the example set in religious training by the parents is of prime importance. It is unusual for a child to seek religion if his parents have not shown interest or activity in this regard. President Joseph F. Smith said: 859 It does not need argument to convince our minds that our children will be just about what we make them. They are born without knowledge or understanding? the most helpless creatures of the animal creation born into the world.. And the child will be largely what its environment and its parents and teachers make it (Gospel Doctrine, page 367). The Responsibility of Parents As Latter-day Saint parents, we are charged with a sacred responsibility to teach our children the gospel. From the Doctrine and Covenants 68:25, 28, we read: And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.... And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord. As President Joseph F'. Smith said: One of the most important duties devolving upon the Latter-day Saints is the proper training and rearing of their children in the faith of the gospel. The gospel is the greatest thing in all the world. There is nothing to compare with it. The possessions of this earth are of no consequence when compared with the blessings of the gospel. Naked we came into the world, and naked we will go out of the world, so far as earthly things are concerned; for we must leave them behind; but the eternal possessions which are ours through obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ do not perish (Gospel Doctrine, page 392). Parents sometimes suppose that if, they send or take their children to" Sunday School, Primary, and to the Mutual Improvement Association, they have fulfilled their obligations concerning gospel training. Far too many risk their children's spiritual guidance to chance, or to others rather than to themselves, and think that organizations suffice for religious training. Our temporal bodies would soon become emaciated, if we fed them only once a week, or twice, as some of us are in the habit of feeding our spiritual and religious bodies.... No; on the other hand, this should be done every day, and in the home, by precept, teaching and example Spend ten minutes in reading a chapter from the words of the Lord in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, before you retire, or before you go to your daily toil. Feed your spiritual selves at home, as well as in public places (Gospel Doctrine, page 377). Nothing can take the place of religious instruction in the home. Teachings of the auxiliary organizations only augment and supplement. The foundation, the groundwork, must be given in the home. Habit can be a great aid in any endeavor. People remark, "There doesn't seem to be any time for family reading or teaching. How can we find time to give our children religious training? 'They are never at home at the same time." There are two solutions to this problem. The first is: Begin teaching your children while they are still small, when they are at home the greater part of the time, and make it your first duty to be at home with them to give them what they should have. The second solution lies in appointing a regular time, most convenient to all. Fifteen minutes will perhaps be enough. Keep to the schedule. Perhaps dinner could be set a little, early and fifteen minutes immediately afterward reserved for reading. Even if every member of the family could not be in attendance every evening, they could participate most of the time. Habit is the surest assurance of success. The benefit to be derived from even a fifteen minute period of gospel study each day cannot be estimated. What to Teach What should be included in this religious instruction? President Joseph F. Smith said: It is the duty of Latter-day Saints to teach their children the truth, to bring them up in the way they should go, to teach them the first principles of the gospel, the necessity of baptism for the remission of sins, and for membership in the Church of Christ;... Necessity of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, which will lead them into all truth. Teach your children the love of God, teach them to love the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Teach them to love their fellow men, and especially to love their fellow members in the Church, that they may be true to their fellowship with the people of God. Teach them to honor the Priesthood, to honor the authority that God has bestowed upon his Church for the proper government of his Church.... Teach them that the Prophet Joseph Smith had restored to him the Priesthood that was held by Peter and James and John, who were ordained under the hands of the Savior himself.... Teach your children to respect their bishops and the teachers that come to their homes to teach them. Teach your children to respect old age, gray hairs, and feeble frames. Teach them to venerate and to hold in honorable remembrance their parents, and to help all those who are helpless and needy. Teach your children to honor the law of God and the law of the state and the law of our country. Teach them to respect and hold in honor those who are chosen by the people to stand at their head and execute justice and administer the law. Teach them to be loyal to their country, loyal to righteousness and uprightness and honor....  LESSON DEPARTMENT Children should be taught early in life that death is really a necessity as well as a blessing, and that we would not and could not be satisfied and supremely happy without it.... No explanation of death to a child's mind can anywhere be found that is more simple and convincing than is the death of our Master, connected as it is and ever must be with the glorious resurrection (Gospel Doctrine, pp. 364, 365, 366). Children should be prepared to meet the issues of life before they come face to face with them. They should be prepared for courtship, for marriage in the temple, for the duties of parenthood. Young people going to attend universities should be taught to evaluate correctly the courses of study offered them. "Latter-day Saints accept every scientific fact, but rate theories based upon the facts as human explanations of the facts, likely to change as new facts appear.... Any theory that leaves out God as a personal, purposeful Being, and accepts chance as a first cause, cannot be accepted by Latter-day Saints." (See Widtsoe's Evidences and Reconciliations, PP- 154, 155.) That which is demonstrated, we accept with joy, but vain philosophy, human theory and mere speculations of men we do not accept, nor do we adopt anything contrary to divine revelation or to good common sense, but everything that tends to right conduct, that harmonizes with sound morality and increases faith in Deity, finds favor with us, no matter where it may be found (Gospel Doctrine, page 48). Home Evenings Church authorities advise that we make a practice of having a weekly "home evening," wherein our families may get together to discuss family affairs, study the gospel and, in general, enjoy each other's society. The home has in many cases ceased to be the center of attraction as it used to be, and members of the family often have so many outside interests that they scarcely see each other. A return to a more simple routine is advisable. The successful home evening would be a stride in this direction. Here again it is wisdom to begin early. When the children are small, conditions are ideal for setting the home evening habit? There are not many demands on the time of small children, the parents have them to themselves, and the home evening can be an occasion to be anticipated. It should be planned so that it is such. Sometimes there might be group singing around the piano, retold or reread stories, appropriate for the children, and a short discussion on proper conduct and gospel teaching. This is an excellent opportunity to teach the gospel a little at a time. If the program is varied, it will have greater appeal. Family problems might be discussed, with all old enough voicing opinions. Then games might be introduced and refreshments served. Members of the family might take turns planning the program. This would give the children a feeling of importance and encourage initiative, and the one in charge of the evening should be complimented upon the success of the evening. When the children are older, the home evening should still be continued. An evening should be chosen when most members will be at home, but if one or another cannot be in attendance, the home evening should be held anyway. All will be able to be present at least on some of the evenings, and will receive great benefit from the family gatherings. Table tennis, part singing, topics of interest in world affairs, or any other activity might be introduced to foster a close association of members of the family. Part of the time, however, should be devoted to reading or discussion of gospel principles. The maxim "Where there's a will there's a way," is very applicable to the success of the home evening project. If the will to put it over is there, it can certainly be worked out satisfactorily. Any program which becomes a fixed routine is accepted. When children are grown, they will look back on the weekly home evenings as being some of their most treasured memories times of nearness and dearness to each other. Questions for Discussion 1. Of how much importance is religious training in the home? Discuss. 2. What is the fallacy in letting children grow up and then choose the religion they wish? 3. What is the responsibility of parents in regard to religious instruction? Have someone read Doctrine and Covenants 68: 25-29. 4. What part do the auxiliaries play in gospel training? 5- What constitutes a successful "home evening'? Urge Relief Society sisters to begin home evenings among their respective families. 6. Why should the home evening be inaugurated when the children are young? 7. Have members tell of happy and profitable home evenings they have experienced. 8. A short demonstration might be given of a successful home evening program. References Doctrine and Covenants, 68:25-29.
