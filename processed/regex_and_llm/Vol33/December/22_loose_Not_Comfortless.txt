NOT COMFORTLESS Beatrice K. Ekman In a manger, on the fragrant hay, She laid her newborn Son, Unmindful that his destined way To Calvary would run. My son was born on a costly bed; I cradled him in down; He lies where crosses mark the dead In the fields of an alien town. She who had wept at Calvary Beheld the risen Lord, And IJ, when heartbreak came to me, Found comfort in his word.  CHRISTMAS CARDS
