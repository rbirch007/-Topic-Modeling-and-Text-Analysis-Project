Vol. 34 Mary J. Wilson NOVEMBER 1947 THEALL THAT LIFTS TO BEAUTY Berta H. Christensen We thank thee Lord for the intangibles We cannot weigh or hold within the hand, Yet are as integral to life as breath, And less elusive than the shore's white sand. Thanks for the faith that goes with every seed Into the quietly receptive loam, For faith that lights a candle in the dark Of windows, for a loved one coming home. | For truth, which is not bounded by a line, Or margined by the years. Beyond the scars Of doubt and disillusionment, it lives Lasting and bright as the eternal stars. Thanks for the tender reach of thought; the dream Of spring beyond the ice-encrusted tree; For laughter in a baby's eyes, and all That lifts the heart to beauty thanks to thee!
