Reading and Writing in Deseret Anna Boss Hart Member, Relief Society General Board Illustrations by Dawn Andrus HAT a record of achievement is the story of the Latter-day Saint pioneers from the time of Deseret to the Centennial! During this greatest of years the Centennial Year, the lives of the pioneers have been re-evaluated, hearts have been turned to their greatness and achievement. We have marveled at their clear vision, their love of the graces and refinements of life, their zest for learning, their eagerness for searching truth, and their accomplishment. Our present streamlined educational system, with its. Towering buildings, its elaborate methods of instruction, its rigidly trained group of specialized administrators and teachers, is a contrast to the humble school of the pioneers, with its primitive buildings, its meager equipment, its precious, but simple course of study, and its poorly equipped students. After the first thought was given to the tilling of the soil, the next thought was given to the developing of the soul, which must also have food and sustenance. The pioneers recognized that power would be theirs through knowledge. How symbolic was the name they selected   "Deseret"   meaning honeybee! As the honeybee has come to mean industry, the pioneers sucked the honey of truth and built a hive of industry and wealth  temporal and spiritual. Page 732 The urge for education penetrated the souls of the early pioneers before they left Nauvoo. The Prophet Joseph Smith, a great educator, preached the furtherance of learning with eloquence, strength, fervor, keen desire, zest, and earnestness. In 1831, two leading elders were given the assignment "to do the work of printing and of selecting and writing books for the schools of this Church, that little children also may receive instruction" (D. & C. 55:4). The University of Nauvoo came into being in 1840. Arts, sciences, and "learned professions" were planned for the curriculum. The Nauvoo City Charter obtained by the saints provided for the "first municipal university in America." One of the first free schools in Illinois was opened by Parley P. Pratt. At Winter Quarters, during the frigid winter of 1847, a log house with dirt floor and dirt roof was converted into a schoolroom, with Emmeline B. Wells as the instructor. The prophetic urge for education was also in the heart of Brigham Young. Before leaving Winter Quarters he urged the pioneers to bring "'a copy of every available treatise on education every book, map, chart, or diagram that may contain interesting, useful, and attractive matter to gain the attention of children and cause them to learn to read; and every historical, mathematical, philosophical, geographical, READING AND WRITING IN DESERET geological, astronomical, scientific, and all other variety of useful and Interesting writing, maps, etc."   can imagine the many saints who "heeded his words" and how many old textbooks found their way into precious comers with rare china, a priceless wedding dress, or a bit of old lace. HEN the Pioneers came to the valleys of among the first institutions to be Provided were schools and seminaries for the training of the saints, Organized in the Rocky Mountains! At happy students Must have trudged the first dirt paths to that school! Writes that Mary Jane Dilworth had nine Pupils on had a N speller, half a q arithmetic book, across the plains. Mary Jane Dilworth arrived in Salt Lake Valley with the second company of pioneers, in September 733 be remembered as the first teacher recorded in the history of Deseret and the one who Placed the "first stone in the foundation of the Present magnificent Which Utah is One teacher was given a willow chair which the schoolboys made. Schoolteacher, arrived at Brown's Fort, October 27, 1849. She states winter she taught school in a log house: We had to collect letters from Scraps of papers and old books; these We pasted on paddles. We also made letters on the side of our hands. In this way the children learned to read. Six months after the founding of Manti, in 18 50, Jesse W. Fox opened a school "for juveniles, and was reading to the adults, evenings, by the light of a tallow-dip and the campre." Lydia Stanley was the teach- r RUNNING FOR A DRINK OF WATER er who opened a school in "a hut of logs and brush on the banks of the Jordan." What a contrast in school buildings from the humble shelters of early pioneer days to the spacious and stately buildings of today! GCHOOLS were held in all types of buildings. The first school was housed in a military tent shaped like a wigwam. Groves and boweries were used, private houses, and public buildings. 'The log house was common, with "roof garden of mud and sunflowers; a dirt floor packed hard by feet, which were mostly bare." Sometimes the floors, consisting of split logs, were smoothed with an adze. Sometimes the walls were split logs "laid close together and covered with cedar bark or rushes that grew about the marshes." Windows were sometimes covered with cloth greased with fat. This was used instead of glass. Sometimes they were covered with white cloth to admit light.' One schoolhouse was part of a fort wall, with portholes for defense against Indians. Adobe houses were often used. The red ones were especially colorful. The size varied from small twelve-by-twelve foot rooms to two-story frame buildings with the stairs to the upper story built on the outside wall. Even garrets were used, and a "lean-to-room near the United Order storehouse." George A. Smith's first school is pictured in his diary, March 3d, 1851: My wicky-up is a very important establishment, composed of brush, a few slabs and 3 wagons. A fire in the center and a lot of milking stools, benches and logs placed around, two of which are fashioned with buffalo robes. It answers for various purposes, kitchen, schoolhouse, dining room, meeting house, council house, sitting room, reading room, storeroom. To see my school some of the cold nights in February, scholars standing around my huge campfire, the wind broken off by the brush and the whole canopy of heaven for covering. George A. Smith was a colorful figure conducting classes "by the light of the campfire during the founding of the far southern settlement of Parowan." Ada Arvilla Burke Earl, born in Farmington, Utah, May 28, 1857, said in her diary: We started school at a very early age and I remember carrying bread and a jug of milk for our lunch and Mrs. Lyman would give us dishes and spoons to eat our bread and milk in. Another pioneer wrote: When nothing better was available for the mid-day meal, the children went out and dug sego roots. The schools created an atmosphere of industry, co-operation, and happiness. The pupils made their  READING AND WRITING IN DESERET own entertainment and jollity. What fun they would have on Friday afternoons at the "spelling down" matches! Then there were declamation contests, organ solos, singing programs, and occasional plays or concerts. In the Brigham Young School they would often fin-, ish up a Friday afternoon with the reading of the weekly paper made up entirely from contributions from the scholars and edited by one of them. Games played during recess might have been baseball, or steal-the-stick, or drop-the-handkerchief. "'At times we played Indian and made bows and arrows," says Lorenzo D. Young, 'who attended Miss Dilworth's first school. UNISHMENTS were also necessary at times. Silas Hillman said "YOU'RE ASKING FOR A SPANKING" 735 that, although punishment was used, little whipping was done. The other forms of punishment were as follows: The first offense was punishable by having the offender stand in the middle of the floor; the second, to stand on one   foot; the third, on one foot with one arm raised; the fourth, on one foot with the raised arm holding a stick. Next came the dunce cap and various other unique ways of trying to keep order. In the Bigham Young School the individual desks were painted green, with drop lids. These could be raised and, as Clarissa Y. Spencer expressed it: "It was very convenient to raise the lid, and behind it, eat a choice apple or read a note from one of the boys, being quite sure the teacher would not see us." Later, more fortunate teachers had some charts on the walls for the youngest children and slates and pencils for the older ones. In imagination we can hear the scratchy slate pencils, which had been made from slate rock whittled down. Later, when paper could be obtained, quills were used for pens, and sharpened by the teacher with her sharp knife. Oak bark and copperas were boiled together for ink. Those who had neither pencils, slates, pen, nor ink took charcoal and "wrote on smooth logs or dried bark of the white mountain birch." There was a great scarcity of books in pioneer days. Bibles and other standard works of the Church were available, but references and textbooks were limited. What rapture must have been felt by the saints when Wilford W. Woodruff arrived from the States with nearly two tons of school books. This event was recounted in the Deseret News of November 27, 1852:
Some of the books used during the first brief school year in Utah were the Bible, Noah Webster's Spelling Book, the Lindley Murray Readers, and A New and Complete Arithmetic Composed for Citizens of the United States. Others available at that time were a medical work by Dr. Gunn, a universal history, and occasionally there would be found a Blackstone and other legal books. Dr. Bernhisel brought a large number of books of every type from the East. Mention is also made of Kirkham's Grammar, Smith's Arithmetic, the Wilson Readers, Cornell's Geography, Ray's Arithmetic, and Elementary Arithmetic. Spencerian copybooks were often used to perfect writing.
With what pride the owners of a McGuffey's First Reader, published in 1836, studied its contents. The owner of this book cherished the illustrations "designed to be used by lovers of art. This book was handled almost reverently and placed on the shelf or table with the carefully dusted and much used Bible and other cherished and treasured books. Lessons of courtesy and morals were almost shouted at the end of each story.
IN 1848 the Legislative Assembly enacted its first law which provided for good roads. Its second law provided for a University of the State of Deseret, claimed to be the first institution of higher learning west of the Mississippi."
In February 1850 Orson Spencer was appointed chancellor. Twelve members to make up the Board of Regents were also appointed. "Until 1869 its existence was little more than nominal. . . . Then the annual grant of $3,000 for its support came from an empty treasury."
Three men comprised the first faculty�Orson Pratt, Cyrus W. Collins, and Orson Spencer. Each of the forty students paid $8 or its equivalent every ten weeks.
For a time the University was a "Parents' School." It was held in the front parlor of the John Pack home on the corner of West Temple and First North Street in Salt Lake City. After awhile the "Parents' School" was discontinued. It was one of the most interesting experiments conducted in Utah education.
Tuition and salaries were problems in those early days. The parents had to furnish their own books, building materials to produce, such as potatoes,
they occur." The illustrations served also for oral lessons in language, for spelling, word pronunciations, stories, and memorization. Many pictures were carefully traced by lovers of art. This book was handled almost reverently and placed on the shelf or table with the carefully dusted and much used Bible and other cherished and treasured books. Lessons of courtesy and morals were almost shouted at the end of each story. 
READING AND WRITING IN DESERET eggs, and butter. Nearly a century ago, a student registering at the "Parents' School" could pay his tuition with lumber, flour, wheat, building stone, or potatoes. Someone wrote that the "teachers" salaries instead of being drawn on the bank were drawn on wheelbarrows." How resourceful were those early teachers! Even a new alphabet, called the Deseret Alphabet, of thirty-two letters, was created for the use of the Latter-day Saint people. Probably the purpose for creating this alphabet was to "simplify the reading of the English language." The new alphabet, although it possessed many meritorious features, was used very little even in pioneer days, and was finally abandoned. The "Charter granted Salt Lake City in 1851 by the Territorial Legislature provided for the establishment and regulation of schools. Similar provisions were made in the charters of all the early Utah towns." By 1850 "common schools were 737 beginning in all parts of the city for the winter." 'Then the Territory of Utah next came into existence. September 23, 1851, addressing the Legislative Assembly, Governor Young "advocated the encouragement of primary schools and suggested that the Legislature consider the propriety of requiring the inhabitants of each neighborhood to maintain a school." American Fork is credited with being the first town to sponsor a school "entirely' supported by taxes." It was the first school in Utah that was free to all children. HE history of Latter-day Saint schools of higher learning, headed by the Brigham Young University in Provo, shows that the pioneers were staunch friends of religious education, 'which should be free from prejudice and free for all." Karl G. Maeser's name is indeed "a benediction to the name of education" in Utah. SPELLING LINE-UP What an important place he made! Beloved, master teacher, he did a great part in establishing schools throughout Deseret, and for about sixteen years "he directed the growth of the Brigham Young Academy at Provo." He was called by President Brigham Young to direct this institution which opened for instruction in January 1876, although Brother Maeser did not begin his work as a teacher until April of that year. He was a cultured gentleman in every way, an orator, "a technician in character building," who understood and endured hardships cheerfully, served unselfishly, and enshrined himself to his students forever. In the midst of all this college making, the Utah State Agricultural College was established at Logan as a land-grant school. This college was founded by the Territorial Legislature to take advantage of a succession of Federal Acts which provided for support of agricultural colleges and experiment stations throughout the Nation. Instruction was started in the fall of 1890, with nine teachers and 135 students. The university programs were supplemented by Latter-day Saint junior colleges and by mission schools established and directed by other religious denominations. These schools, which resembled our present-day high schools in some respects, helped to prepare students for work in the universities and gave others a background for beginning their life's responsibilities. What a foundation in education has been made in Utah from "Deseret to Centennial!" And as Daniel Webster once said, "We live in the past by a knowledge of its history, and in the future by hope and anticipation." As we face the future, let us think of the brave and valiant ones who made this firm foundation. May the educators of the future realize that excellence comes from planning over a long period of time, as the pioneers did. May they rededicate themselves, may their classes be as miracles; may the teachers of the future enrich the vision of the students and thereby shape characters and destiny.  FIRST SCHOOL- 1847 Eva Willes Wangsgaard Their schoolhouse built of logs, a single room, A floor of earth well-packed by unshod feet, A roof of mud made bright by sunflower bloom, A window casement near a dusty street; A paddle made of wood to serve as chart With pasted letters cut from an outworn book And scraps of papers, poems learned by heart And copied on the flat stones from a brook; And lacking these, a happy, outstretched hand Became a slate where charcoal could write The numbers which a child must understand Before he solved a problem to recite  How could they see with eyes still hunger-blurred An empire dormant in the written word?  A MAN MUST WORK Alice Morrey Bailey IT was hard for Helen not to open up her heart to hope again. The day was perfect for Thanksgiving. Outside the bare branches of trees rose from carpets of bronze-yellow leaves, to stand purple against the clear, turquoise sky. There was a turkey in the oven, a pumpkin pie cooling on a grate and all the "fixings" in the refrigerator. Ranee's bass voice was roaring, "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning" in the bath- room, but for Helen it was a day of last resort after a year of frustration. She hadn't known what it would be like to be a doctor's wife. "Which towel do I use?" Ranee interrupted his song to shout. Your own, Dumb, Helen thought. Aloud she called back, "The one on the south rack." If this was to be the last day she would play it straight and fair, and right up to the hilt. No one would ever say it was her fault their marriage failed. Ranee came out of the bathroom, slipping the knot into his necktie. He came over to tip her face to his for a kiss, and her heart turned over. Score one for marriage, she thought. He might even say he loved her, but he didn't. "Where's my anatomy book?" he asked, and her heart registered zero. "What is this, mutiny? I thought you were going to help me with dinner." "Can't. Have to assist with an operation in the morning. Have to brush up on my anatomy." "Ranee, no one knows anatomy like you do." That I humbly acknowledge, but this is a lip cancer that has spread into the fascia of the neck. Cut one artery there and the whole field is flooded." "Ugh! Ranee, do you have to be so graphic?� Rance went into the studio and closed the door, without answering. Helen looked at it with hatred. It was a long established rule that when Ranee studied there were to be no interruptions. She hated the books behind that door. She even hated the stethoscope that dangled so casually from his pocket, and the little black bag that went everywhere with him. This was to be my day, she thought bitterly. It was the first anniversary of their wedding, but did he remember? Not as of eleven a.m. on this fine Thursday. And would she remind him? She would not. She had reminded him of every holiday since their marriage, to say nothing of various dinners and scores of special occasions. This one he had to think of all by himself, and if he didn't it was the end! Without exception, he had spent the anniversaries and holidays riding ambulances, delivering babies, answering night calls, and performing emergency operations. What good was it to be connected with the largest firm in the state when he was the junior member and the leg-man for the whole outfit? When she pointed it out to him, he answered: "But think of all the valuable Page 739 experience I'm getting. This is all right, Baby. This is swell." Well, it isn't swell for me, she thought, slamming the oven door. Why had he married her at all, if all he wanted was to put her light under a bushel? She could have married any one of dozens Hilliard Baker for one, whose father was a banker. Betty Fenn, who had married him, had her own car, scads of clothes, and was the young social matron of the town. Hilliard was attentive to Betty and there were parties and dances every night. Why had Rance wanted her if she was to be nothing except part of the furnishing for his house the tap you could turn on and off, the toaster, to burn hot or cold as he desired, a chair that could sit Inanimate and still as he wished? I have to calm down, she reminded herself. She had to be honest. She hadn't wanted Hilliard Baker. She had wanted Rance. 'This was pure jealousy not of people, but of time-consuming work. It was loneliness. A person could be very lonely in a world of people. At any rate, there was still the dinner, and there was the afternoon ahead, and the evening. Helen gave herself a mental shaking and began spreading pimento cheese in the hollows of crisp white celery. This was really going to be a dinner! She would fix the sweet potatoes with marshmallows. At one o'clock Rance came out to get a drink of water. "Um! Good!" he pronounced, sniffing the odors of the kitchen. He had to peep into the oven at the turkey, and, if Helen hadn't caught him in time, he would have pinched the crust of the pie. "How soon is dinner? I'm carrying in, and these aromas are devastating to my will power." "At two o'clock one more hour." "Sixty whole minutes? I don't think I can bear it, but it will work out just right. One more hour with Morris will just about do it." Morris was the anatomy text. He went back to the study, this time closing the door reluctantly after a rueful wink and grin at Helen. She set the table with a lighter heart, getting out her wedding silver and lace, and making an attractive centerpiece of fruit apples and pears, peaches and grapes, sprinkled with nuts and small, colored candies, pouring from a horn of plenty she had shaped and gilded days before. It looked classic on a mirror ringed with leaves and blue plums. HEN Rance came out, he whistled in surprise and examined the horn with flattering interest. "So! You made it yourself! How clever!" "Oh, Rance, I had a terrible time making it come right with that papier-mache." "Why didn't you tell me? I'd have got some casting plaster from surgery. I might even have made it myself. I'm pretty handy putting on a cast, you know.", "You'd have been too busy, Rance. You'll just have time to change while I'm serving the dinner." "Right," he said, and went to the bedroom. When he came out, handsome and distinguished, the turkey was on the table, little bubbles of juice still sliding under the transparent golden skin, the dressing emitting sage and onion-laden  A MAN MUST WORK steam, and the rolls hot under a napkin. Sweet potatoes and celery were flanked by buttered Brussels sprouts and cranberry sauce, and the pie, heaped with whipped cream, was waiting in the kitchen to be served later. "You should try the view from this altitude," said Rance. "It's simply ravishing!" His praise made all her efforts worthwhile, and Helen found resentment slipping away fast. "What are we going to do after dinner, Rance?" she asked, as he slid her chair under her. "Follow your prescription," Rance said, "take in a show, go to a dance, or just loll around and catch up on a little love-making. Whatever you say." "Oh Rance!" she decided, "I only want one thing to be with you!" Tt was going to be a good day, after all, not the last day. It was going to be all right. "I'm so thankful for you, Rance," she said. "And I for you!" BUT it wasn't all right. Rance was actually raising the knife to carve the turkey when the telephone rang. "PIL get it," he said, and Helen waited, her blood jelling in her veins. "Hello? Dr. Moore speaking," and, after a pause, "I'll be right there." "Rance, you can't go without eating," Helen protested as he passed the table on the way to the study. "Hand me my coat," Rance said, and his voice was almost curt. "Rance, this is Thanksgiving!" "And this is an emergency!" He was gone. Slamming the car 741 door, turning the key, stepping on the gas and shifting gears in what seemed to be one motion, without so much as waving to her. Helen had followed him to the steps, but now she turned and went slowly back into the house, dark with resentment, sick with disappointment. She sat and stared at her food, not wanting to eat. Maybe if she waited he would be back to eat with her. At least, she told herself hopefully, he would telephone and let her know when to expect him. An hour later she had had no word from him, and she was angry. Now she wouldn't eat. Not understanding her own reasoning, she made up her mind that the table: could stay exactly as it was, biscuits and turkey cold on the table, until he came to eat with her. It might be five hours and it might be five minutes. It didn't matter. After they had eaten this one last meal she would make a little speech, and then she would leave. She'd had all she could take, she would tell him. She was sure, she would say, cuttingly, that he would never miss her from his busy life. She went angrily and packed a bag. And if he ever remembered it was their anniversary she had an answer for that, too. "At last I know why you wanted to be married on Thanksgiving," she would tell him. "It was so you wouldn't have to take two days from your precious work!" At five there was still no word, and she walked the floor, building up the case against him, tearing it down with some small, sweet memory, building it up again with 742 timbers of disappointment from other days like today. Waiting, she decided, was the most dreadful thing that could happen to anyone. She couldn't do a thing like this to a person she loved. In fact, Rance had never done it to her before. He always called up, if only to leave word where he could be reached in the event of other calls. There usually were other calls. The telephone was curiously silent. The whole house was silent, except for the hum of the refrigerator, and that sound was peculiarly grating today. HE tried to play the piano, but came across an old song of fishermen who went to sea and perhaps did not return. For men must work And women must weep, And the sooner it's over The sooner to sleep. It depressed her. Not for anyone would she spend her life like this! It was getting dark when a car slid to the curb. Her heart leaped, but it was Betty Baker. She came in in a little rush, sobbing and catapulting herself into Helen's arms. It seemed she was going to leave Hilliard. "Helen, he's lazy!" she summed up. "All that money and nothing to do. You know how. Ambitious T am!" "But you have him all the time. Your car and your lovely clothes. All the parties and fun " wondered Helen aloud. "All that can be pretty tiresome," complained Betty. "And having a man around underfoot I guess I oughtn't to say this, but even lovemaking gets monotonous." "Why don't you get him to leave it all get him out on his own?" "And leave all we have? I couldn't! I couldn't live in poverty," declared Betty. "I guess I don't appreciate Hilliard. Helen, you're so wise.' It was quite devastating, even dis. Gusting to Helen, because it gave her a new view of herself, planning to leave Rance for the very opposite reasons Betty had. What's the matter with us, Helen wondered? We're smart and ingenious about other things. Why do we think divorce is the only solution for marriage difficulties? It's a mental disease. And it's catching! As Betty was leaving to "try it again," she popped her head back in to say: "I wouldn't have come if I could have reached you on the telephone. All I got since two o'clock was the busy signal. Bye, darling." The telephone hadn't rung once, and it was a one-party line. Wondering, Helen went to it. Surely enough, the receiver was placed improperly in its cradle, leaving it open. 'The operator, trying to ring her, explained the maddening hum. Rance had done it in his haste. No one could have called in, not even Rance himself. "I don't deserve a man_ like Rance," she told herself, and went shamefacedly to unpack. She would tell him about it when he got home, and start all over again, for those were the very traits she had loved him for his love for his work, his passion for knowledge, and his desire to be on hand when he was needed. She returned the foods to their kettles and set them in the oven, and was just washing the platters and A MAN MUST WORK serving dishes when she _ heard Rance's car in the driveway. She lighted the oven and ran to meet him at the door. "How lucky! Just in time for Thanksgiving dinner, Dr. Moore. Won't you come in?" "I tried and tried to get you." Rance's face was gray with fatigue. He looked as if he had used his last spurt of energy to get home. "Sit down, dear. Dinner will be ready as soon as the turkey gets heated through. You left the receiver off its hook, and I just found it out." "Great Scot! I thought all kinds of things." "I�ll bet you haven't had a bite. Was it bad?" "A terrible smashup. Two major operations, and I couldn't locate a soul. The intern at the hospital assisted. We saved their lives, but we wouldn't have saved the girl if I had been a second later. She looked so much like you it was like fighting for your life." 743 "If you had stopped to eat ?" "Exactly, but listen to the news I wanted to tell you. Dr. Randome came in as I was mopping up. He said a lot of nice things, mainly that I'm to take the permanent post of surgery. Mort is retiring and they'll have a new man in for the leg-work." "Oh, Rance!" "This last year has been stiff, but I'm over the hump, and I couldn't have made it without you. Imagine a woman waiting dinner six hours! But ['m one up on you. I'l bet you forgot it is our wedding anniversary."" "Yup!" gulped Helen, taken by surprise. "Rance, I " She started to tell him about the day, but thought better of it. That self-centered girl of the morning was gone. "Don't give me credit. Remember that song: 'Men must work and women must weep?' "' "Weep no more, my lady, then," countered Rance, and kissed her. "Now let's eat!"  THANKSGIVING GRACE Dorothy ]. Roberts Place the bird breast upward on the platter, Ringed with ears of tapered, golden maize.
