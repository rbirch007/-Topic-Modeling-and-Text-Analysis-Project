Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon THROUGH experimental research, Dr. Ruth Moore Graham has developed a technique for discovering, in the early stages of certain types of internal cancer, whether or not X-Ray treatment is proving effective. Heretofore this important knowledge was unavailable. Dr. Graham is a native of Paris, Idaho, and was a student at Westminster College, Salt Lake City. She lives in the suburbs of Boston, and has two children. HE American Association of University Women, under its international study program, has brought thirty-seven brilliant professional women from Europe to the United States for additional university training. One of the group, Miss Helga Pedersen, a noted lawyer from Denmark, was personal assistant to the Danish Minister of Justice and helped to try 20,000 cases of war treason and collaboration. OIA Mentschikoff, on a leave of absence from a Wall Street law firm, is teaching commercial law at Harvard law school. She is the first woman to break into the ranks of men instructors in that school. Al the Governor's Conference in Salt Lake City last July, Miss Lisle Bradford, of pioneer ancestry, learned that she and Robert F. Bradford, Governor of Massachusetts, are both descended through nine geneS \ 2 Ni erations from William Bradford who came to this country on the Mayflower and was the first governor of Plymouth Colony. He was elected president of the first confederation in America, as attested by a document signed by Miles Standish. Governor Bradford has this original document in his possession and will send a photostatic copy to his "cousin." Miss Bradford is head of the music department at East High School, and recently directed a well-trained chorus in a long series of weekly broadcasts. T the great tennis tournament in England, Margaret Osborne, of San Francisco, won the women's singles, and Patricia Canning Todd, of La Jolla, California, and Doris Hart, of Miami, Florida, won the women's doubles.

Page 599 VOL 4 1947 NO. 9 A Testament of Liberty And for this Purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose (D. & C 101:80) AGAIN September has come, and the people of America are gathering an abundant harvest. The granaries and the storehouses of our country are overflowing with the bounty of fields and orchards. We see once more the evidence that the earth is good, that it will provide for the Physical needs of the people. Gratitude for food, and the opportunity for storing it against a time of need, should be unbounded, particularly at this time when there is so much hunger in the world. We should not think, however, that the abundance which we enjoy is entirely a result of the richness of our land, its sunlight and soil and rainfall, our civil liberties, Public schools, free assemblies, our press, our churches  4s a natural consequence of the inherent wealth of our Nation, The greatest riches of any country lie in the character of its people and in the type of government which they establish and support. On the 17th of September, 1787, one of the most important documents of all time was completed. Page 600 The Constitution of the United States was ready to be submitted to the states for their consideration, Capable and patriotic Statesmen, realizing the magnitude of their task, had worked untiringly to formulate an instrument which might direct the building of a �More perfect union," This document, destined to be-come "the tree of liberty," emphasized and guaranteed fundamental rights of individuals. Thus the founding fathers based the structure of t he new federation upon the ancient principle that men are free because God has given them freedom and free agency. During 160 years of testing, the Constitution of the United States has weathered many storms. In times of peaceful development, and in times of crisis, patriotic citizens have spoken of their Constitution as a living document of greatest value. Devout and grateful people have appreciated it as a standard "to which the wise and honest can repair." Today? there are some who not only profess no allegiance to the Constitution, but seek to supplant its provisions with the tenets of another social order. They speak of the Constitution as an outmoded instrument, no longer capable of protecting certain groups against exploitation by others. A dangerous division in ideals and loyalties is becoming increasingly apparent, and many people are using their privileges as citizens to work against the very EDITORIAL 601 instrument which guarantees them free speech and free endeavor.
As Latter-day Saints we have been given prophetic enlightenment concerning the observance of law. Our presidents and leaders have emphasized our responsibility in giving undivided allegiance to our country and its lawful institutions. Let us, today, live in accordance with the
words of the Prophet Joseph Smith which he offered as part of the dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple in 1836, in which he voiced this hope for the Nation:
Have mercy, O Lord, upon the rulers of the land; may those principles which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever.

BEAUTY
Sylvia Probst Young
Today I saw them pass along my street� Three people clothed in beauty each his own: One was fair and young, with dancing feet, And eager eyes that sought a world unknown, In his round, boyish features I could see All of the beauty of expectancy.
The second trod on tired feet and old, His hoary head was bowed, and on his face, Deep furrowed, was a story time had told Of suffering, written on a noble plate. His faded eyes were warmed by memory� Beauty I saw in silent reverie.
The last, a girl who, in her quiet way, Did so much good, passed so much cheer along, While deep within her heart a sorrow lay; But no one knew, they only heard her song. Beauty�she wore it like a shining dress, A beauty nurtured by courageousness
