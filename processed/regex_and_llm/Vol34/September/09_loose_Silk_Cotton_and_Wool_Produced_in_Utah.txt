Silk, Cotton, and Wool Produced in Utah Julia A. F. Lund Former Secretary-Treasurer, Relief Society General Board THE year 1947 brings with it a challenge! Janus-like, we stand facing both ways. It is well that it should be so, for the past always offers the key to the meaning of the present, and renews faith and courage with which to meet the future. As this message of the history of the past century is reviewed, it creates a fuller realization of the glorious heritage coming to us from our pioneer mothers and fathers. It brings great happiness to find so much in the spirit of those times with which today we can be in harmony. While history is a record of what has been achieved, it is most uninteresting unless it is illuminated by an understanding of the men and women who lived it. One writer has observed that "The Mormon people are not a religious sect�but an empire building people." Certain it is there were two dominant motives in all they did: the practice of their religion in peace; and the establishment of homes for their families where they could enjoy security and opportunities for advancement.
The three basic needs of humanity�food, shelter, and raiment�presented especially acute problems to Utah's founders. In their struggles to meet the "three existence wants," there is an eloquent but realistic picture of the glory of the commonplace. This struggle depicts the dig-
old-fashioned virtues of thrift and frugality, of resourcefulness and hospitality, of taking the long view, which required endless patience and complete self-forgetfulness.
Many examples of great courage in the face of hardship have come down to us. The fanning on the plains and leaving the harvest for the crows to follow; the story of the young man from the Mormon Battalion, who, in the fall of 1847, walked every step of the way from California to Utah, carrying on his back the bushel of hard wheat seed for the next spring. No matter what the pangs of hunger might have been, that precious seed was not touched!
These are but dramatic examples of the labors and spirit and heroic sacrifices made by all the pioneers in solving the food problem. As a necessary part of providing shelter, the churches and schoolhouses arose along with the first dwellings�a vital part of community building.
The pioneers believed that this region would provide the means for meeting the needs of the people. In the words of the historian Neff,
The soil demonstrated its willingness to yield abundantly under irrigation, if world of building material was available; but the gratification of the clothing needs, while simple enough in theory, was accompanied by a multitude of difficulties the surmounting of which required heroic efforts and measures.

The story of the pioneer textile industries is a most important page in the history of Utah's development. Very little could be expected from the outside, at that time, so the people realized that the answer to their great needs must be in the training of their own hearts, minds, and souls. 'They learned to avoid mistakes by making a great many. Is this not an application of the theory of education advanced by our great modern philosopher John Dewey: "Learn to do things by doing them"? Our pioneers taught by example the real message of history. According to Whitney's History of Utah, from the beginning, President Young and other leaders were most zealous in promoting manual training and home manufacturing. Brigham Young, as Governor, in his message to the Legislature in January 1852, said: Deplorable indeed must be the situation of that people whose sons are not trained in the practice of every useful avocation and whose daughters mingle not in the hive of industry.... Produce what you consume; draw from the native elements the necessities of life; permit no vitiated taste to lead you into indulgence of expensive luxuries, which can only be obtained by involving yourselves in debt. Let home industry produce every article of home consumption. No sounder principle of political economy was ever taught and, at the Governor's suggestion, appropriations were made by the Legislature to encourage the local manufacturing interests. He also asked protective legislation to foster infant industries. The problems of food and shelter being solved, attention was then called to the need for clothing. HE Church leaders all urged the people to bring to their new homes tools of every description.  SILK, COTTON, AND WOOL PRODUCED IN UTAH } 591 They enumerated especially tools required for spinning, weaving, and dressing silk, cotton, and wool. These cards, spinning wheels, and hand looms found a place in the pioneer wagons, and mechanical ingenuity quickly supplied them if they were lacking. 'Silk President Young affirmed that this country was the finest in the world for silk raising. Practical experience proved that Utah is well adapted to the culture of silk. This was satisfactorily demonstrated through the efforts of The Deseret Silk Association of Utah Territory, in 1877. One of the few reports of this industry in Utah is found in "A Treatise on Sericulture," on file in the Church Historian's office. This relates the efforts of the Society, combined with individual labors, which seemed to assure the success of this important branch of home industry at a time when it was greatly needed. The following is from the introduction to the treatise, and expresses the spirit with which every enterprise was undertaken: In the silk growing countries of Europe the feeding and care of the silk worm is mostly done by women and children, This employment affording them means for subsistence. With us, when it becomes a staple production, through its extensive culture, it will not only prove a source of self-sustaining as a clothing department, but of commercial wealth. In its culture and manufacture it will create profitable employment for thousands of the coming generation, who, otherwise, in all probability, would grow up in idleness, the direct road to vice. This should be a weighty consideration with those who regard the future welfare of society and should stimulate to earnest and determined efforts in laying the foundation of this grand enterprise. The elements of Utah abound with the materials which only wait the creative wand of industry to beckon it forth. THE OLD COX HOME, MANTI, UTAH Where silk worms were grown and silk spun from cocoons. 592 This quaint exhortation is followed by a description of the silkworm its hatching, feeding, moulting, spinning cocoons, producing eggs, and how to best preserve it, detriments and antidotes and last, but very important, the cultivation of the mulberry tree. In The Contributor, 1881, appears an article by George D. Pyper on silk culture in Utah. This is of special interest to Relief Society women as it gives an account of the organization of The Utah Silk Association, founded in 1879, with William Jennings president, Eliza R. Snow vice-president, and Zina D. H. Young as a member of the board of directors. In 1868, a cocoonery was built about four miles south of Salt Lake City, and twenty-five or thirty acres of land were planted with mulberry trees. Zina D. H. Young was the first person to take care of the cocoonery. Later, a small building to house the silk industry was erected at the mouth of City Creek Canyon. The silk enterprise was not confined to Salt Lake City alone., The whole 'Territory was more or less engaged in it. The cocoon raising and all phases of the industry required great patience and care, but there were competent people to handle it. The following is an expression of their faith: Silk will be one of the most important branches of Utah's industry and will add greatly to our character of an enterprising and self-sustaining people. Kanab, Orderville, and other places in Southern Utah became interested in producing silk, but it did not prove to be a success financially in those places, though some beautiful dress silks, handkerchiefs, laces, where. and scarves were made; also the elegant fringe used in the trimmings in the St. George Temple.
