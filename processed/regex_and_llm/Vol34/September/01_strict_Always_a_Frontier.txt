ALWAYS A FRONTIER you say? Shall I pick you up in half an hour?" "Yes. Yes, do that, John dear. I'll be ready." She hurriedly slipped into a clean print dress and went to the kitchen to make a few sandwiches, a salad, and a thermos bottle of lemonade. As she was putting a dish towel over the basket, her daughter, brown and straight, and utterly lovely, walked in. "Hi, Mom," she greeted her mother, "what are you up to?" "Your father and I are taking a lunch out to the old farm." "But I was hoping you would press my white skirt while I bathed. We're playing tennis." "It's too hot for tennis. Besides, if you want your dress finished for tomorrow night you had better do a little on the basting. You can sew as well as I can." She didn't mean to sound abrupt, but her daughter looked at her in surprise, protesting, "But, Mother." "There's your father now. If Tom comes in tell him to take your father's suit to the cleaners. Sure now. Goodbye, darlin'." The girl's surprise seemed to grow as she answered, "Goodbye. Have a nice time." Sophronia and her husband drove down the country road, away from the city's rush and heat, her tenseness seemed to gradually leave her. She leaned her head on the seat, sang snatches of song. "Oh, it is beautiful out here, isn't it?" she asked. "I imagine it was fun living here." "Not much fun I'd say, the way grandmother had it," her husband answered, "it was a hard life." 587 Irritation rose in her again. She wanted to protest, to say she had heard Grandmother Storey tell about it. She wanted to cry out, "I'd like to see her take just one day of mine. Just one." It was by sheer will that she was silent, that she smiled at him as he assisted her from the car. When they had finished their lunch and rested awhile in the tall grass, her husband told her, "I think I�ll walk down through the fields, see the canal where we used to swim. Want to come along?" "No. Lying here in the shade seems too good to me. You go." "Sure you won't be lonesome?" She laughed, "Quite, quite sure." She was eager to have him gone that she might close her eyes, soak in the silence and the cooling air, the sound of meadow lark and blue jay. It would be so restful. And it was. Yet, when after what seemed like hours, she looked at her watch and found that only half an hour had passed, she got up and looked around her, at the small rock house, the well set back a hundred yards or more from the house. She could still hear the little old lady who had been John's grandmother saying, "We were lucky to have a well, though I usually carried my wash water from the canal." Sophie could see the blackened bricks still forming part of a circle where grandmother had done her washings winter and summer for ten children, where she had boiled lye and grease to make soap. Sophie saw the long rows of deserted garden which the little lady had said were hers to weed and plant, since the men folks had too much else to do. Oh, it hadn't been easy. Sophie admitted that. 588 GHE walked into the house and shrank a little from the musty darkness of the place, the small rooms, the few, small windows, the remains of a blackened fireplace in which had been done most of the cooking. She stood in what had been the parlor, listened for a sound, a car, a step, a neighbor, but there was nothing but utter silence, deep and stark and unutterably lonely, on all sides of her. She rushed outside, looked anxiously to the west for John. There was no sight of him, so she sat down again in the tall grass and began writing a few notes for her talk. In the distance she heard what must have been the sound of a dog, though for a moment she shuddered, fearing it might be a coyote or some wild animal stalking near, hungry and: vicious. 'That fear, too, must have been with Grandmother Storey on nights when her husband had gone to the city for supplies, and she was alone with her helpless brood. Another hour passed. It seemed eternities. Oh, she couldn't have borne this silence and this isolation, this being cut off from the whole world, working from dawn to dark, no music, no friends. She saw John, then, coming through the fields. He saw her and his step hurried, he waved. Her heart leaped at the sight of him, with love, with welcome and tenderness. Just so, the woman before her had watched for her man, been eager for his coming. She understood it all so well, now. It would never be easy for a woman and a mother. There would always be a frontier to face, to conquer, to rise above. Love was the dream no, the reality that made it all possible, that made the past good, the future full of hope. She could write her speech now. She could finish the dress. It would be fun to take the receiver from its hook and hear a friend say, "Hello," even to hear someone ask a favor. So good to help her children with their problems. How proud she was to be one in the long procession of women who were indomitable and unafraid, who were so richly blessed. She ran forward to meet her husband. MEMORIES Louise Sill Apricot blossoms his pink and white cheeks; Autumn leaves rustling his scurrying feet; A rippling brook his childish laughter! Father, forgive my tears after You took him home! Silk, Cotton, and Wool Produced in Utah Julia A. F. Lund Former Secretary-Treasurer, Relief Society General Board THE year 1947 brings with it a challenge! Janus-like, we stand facing both ways. It is well that it should be so, for the past always offers the key to the meaning of the present, and renews faith and courage with which to meet the future. As this message of the history of the past century is reviewed, it creates a fuller realization of the glorious heritage coming to us from our pioneer mothers and fathers. It brings great happiness to find so much in the spirit of those times with which today we can be in harmony. While history is a record of what has been achieved, it is most uninteresting unless it is illuminated by an understanding of the men and women who lived it. One writer has observed that "The Mormon people are not a religious sect�but an empire building people." Certain it is there were two dominant motives in all they did: the practice of their religion in peace; and the establishment of homes for their families where they could enjoy security and opportunities for advancement.
The three basic needs of humanity�food, shelter, and raiment�presented especially acute problems to Utah's founders. In their struggles to meet the "three existence wants," there is an eloquent but realistic picture of the glory of the commonplace. This struggle depicts the dig-
old-fashioned virtues of thrift and frugality, of resourcefulness and hospitality, of taking the long view, which required endless patience and complete self-forgetfulness.
Many examples of great courage in the face of hardship have come down to us. The fanning on the plains and leaving the harvest for the crows to follow; the story of the young man from the Mormon Battalion, who, in the fall of 1847, walked every step of the way from California to Utah, carrying on his back the bushel of hard wheat seed for the next spring. No matter what the pangs of hunger might have been, that precious seed was not touched!
These are but dramatic examples of the labors and spirit and heroic sacrifices made by all the pioneers in solving the food problem. As a necessary part of providing shelter, the churches and schoolhouses arose along with the first dwellings�a vital part of community building.
The pioneers believed that this region would provide the means for meeting the needs of the people. In the words of the historian Neff,
The soil demonstrated its willingness to yield abundantly under irrigation, if world of building material was available; but the gratification of the clothing needs, while simple enough in theory, was accompanied by a multitude of difficulties the surmounting of which required heroic efforts and measures. Page 589 ELIZA FORSGREN AT HER SILK REEL She demonstrated reeling, spinning, and weaving at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago, in 1893. The story of the pioneer textile industries is a most important page in the history of Utah's development. Very little could be expected from the outside, at that time, so the people realized that the answer to their great needs must be in the training of their own hearts, minds, and souls. 'They learned to avoid mistakes by making a great many. Is this not an application of the theory of education advanced by our great modern philosopher John Dewey: "Learn to do things by doing them"? Our pioneers taught by example the real message of history. According to Whitney's History of Utah, from the beginning, President Young and other leaders were most zealous in promoting manual training and home manufacturing. Brigham Young, as Governor, in his message to the Legislature in January 1852, said: Deplorable indeed must be the situation of that people whose sons are not trained in the practice of every useful avocation and whose daughters mingle not in the hive of industry.... Produce what you consume; draw from the native elements the necessities of life; permit no vitiated taste to lead you into indulgence of expensive luxuries, which can only be obtained by involving yourselves in debt. Let home industry produce every article of home consumption. No sounder principle of political economy was ever taught and, at the Governor's suggestion, appropriations were made by the Legislature to encourage the local manufacturing interests. He also asked protective legislation to foster infant industries. The problems of food and shelter being solved, attention was then called to the need for clothing. HE Church leaders all urged the people to bring to their new homes tools of every description.  SILK, COTTON, AND WOOL PRODUCED IN UTAH } 591 They enumerated especially tools required for spinning, weaving, and dressing silk, cotton, and wool. These cards, spinning wheels, and hand looms found a place in the pioneer wagons, and mechanical ingenuity quickly supplied them if they were lacking. 'Silk President Young affirmed that this country was the finest in the world for silk raising. Practical experience proved that Utah is well adapted to the culture of silk. This was satisfactorily demonstrated through the efforts of The Deseret Silk Association of Utah Territory, in 1877. One of the few reports of this industry in Utah is found in "A Treatise on Sericulture," on file in the Church Historian's office. This relates the efforts of the Society, combined with individual labors, which seemed to assure the success of this important branch of home industry at a time when it was greatly needed. The following is from the introduction to the treatise, and expresses the spirit with which every enterprise was undertaken: In the silk growing countries of Europe the feeding and care of the silk worm is mostly done by women and children, This employment affording them means for subsistence. With us, when it becomes a staple production, through its extensive culture, it will not only prove a source of self-sustaining as a clothing department, but of commercial wealth. In its culture and manufacture it will create profitable employment for thousands of the coming generation, who, otherwise, in all probability, would grow up in idleness, the direct road to vice. This should be a weighty consideration with those who regard the future welfare of society and should stimulate to earnest and determined efforts in laying the foundation of this grand enterprise. The elements of Utah abound with the materials which only wait the creative wand of industry to beckon it forth. THE OLD COX HOME, MANTI, UTAH Where silk worms were grown and silk spun from cocoons. 592 This quaint exhortation is followed by a description of the silkworm its hatching, feeding, moulting, spinning cocoons, producing eggs, and how to best preserve it, detriments and antidotes and last, but very important, the cultivation of the mulberry tree. In The Contributor, 1881, appears an article by George D. Pyper on silk culture in Utah. This is of special interest to Relief Society women as it gives an account of the organization of The Utah Silk Association, founded in 1879, with William Jennings president, Eliza R. Snow vice-president, and Zina D. H. Young as a member of the board of directors. In 1868, a cocoonery was built about four miles south of Salt Lake City, and twenty-five or thirty acres of land were planted with mulberry trees. Zina D. H. Young was the first person to take care of the cocoonery. Later, a small building to house the silk industry was erected at the mouth of City Creek Canyon. The silk enterprise was not confined to Salt Lake City alone., The whole 'Territory was more or less engaged in it. The cocoon raising and all phases of the industry required great patience and care, but there were competent people to handle it. The following is an expression of their faith: Silk will be one of the most important branches of Utah's industry and will add greatly to our character of an enterprising and self-sustaining people. Kanab, Orderville, and other places in Southern Utah became interested in producing silk, but it did not prove to be a success financially in those places, though some beautiful dress silks, handkerchiefs, laces, where. and scarves were made; also the elegant fringe used in the trimmings in the St. George Temple. The longing for beauty and the fine things of life, coupled with the pride in home industry, so strong in the pioneer mothers, found expression in the loyalty with which women supported the silk production. Samples of raw silk sent to New York and European countries were found to be equal to that made any In fact, Italian and French experts pronounced it the best silk produced in America. The elegant curtains which hung in the woman's building at the World's Fair, in 1893, were a fine example of what could be done with the native product. Margaret Caine, a former member of the General Board of Relief Society, was the last secretary of the Utah Silk Association, the records of which are now on file with other valuable historic papers, in care of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers. Cotton According to the historian Neff, the earliest attempt to grow cotton in Utah was doubtless that of Reddin A. Allred of Davis County, who, in 1851, demonstrated that cotton could be grown on the benchland *near Kaysville. It soon became evident, however, that the only section commercially satisfactory for this much desired staple was the extreme southwestern portion of the Territory, popularly known as "Utah's Dixie." Under date of October 1, 1858, The Deseret News published an article under the title "Cotton and Its Culture in Utah." This article reports that, in 1855, the first at- SILK, COTTON, AND WOOL PRODUCED IN UTAH 593  attempts on a large scale to raise cotton in the Territory were made at Fort Clara on the Santa Clara River, three hundred miles south of Salt Lake City. This effort was followed by the Washington colony, in 1861, when several hundred families were called from the northern and central parts of Utah to go to the South and aid in the development of the cotton industry.  The people chosen for this enterprise were those who had been familiar with such work before coming West, and who were experienced not only in the treatment of the cotton, but in the manufacture of cloth. Before the Washington Cotton Factory was built, this work was mainly done by the women in the homes on hand rollers and hand cards. The first big cotton crop of the Territory was about one hundred thousand pounds, which showed that the production of cotton in this section was an assured possibility. In Mary Henderson's manuscript History of Utah, under "Historic Sites and Landmarks," there is a report on the Parowan cotton factory. This factory, it said, was doing "tolerably good work, with a fair prospect that it will be a success, both to the proprietor and the public� (Vol 1, p. 332). A description of the machine which cleaned and prepared the cotton, with other details relative to the manufacture of the finished product follow. The factory was then making yarn of a very superior quality. There were many small cotton plants, especially at Toqueville and Heberville, in the Dixie country. But with cotton, as with silk, the people realized little from the industry other than to meet the needs of the hour. ZINA D. H. YOUNG Zina D. H. Young was the wife of President Brigham Young and was first counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency, 1880-1887, and general president 1888-1901. Sister Zina was given the special mission of forwarding the silk industry by appointment of President Young. She became president of the Deseret Silk Association which was organized in 1875. The difficulty of procuring cotton factory machinery, which was almost unavailable at that time, and the pound cost of production made it impossible to throw the stock on the open market, and caused the discontinuance of the industry at the beginning of the present century. Wool While the West proved a paradise for sheep, the hazards of Indian marauders and wild beasts required eternal vigilance on the part of the early settlers. It is recorded that Parley P. Pratt's company of pioneers brought 358 sheep with them, in 1 847, and there were others of which we have no report. In 1848, 654594 sheep were imported, and the census of 1850 records 3262 sheep in Utah. Since the factory system was not yet in existence, the centers of the textile industry were in the homes. The wool industry was much more extensive and general throughout the entire Territory than was either the silk or cotton industries. The story of wool is an excellent illustration of the independence of the sheep-owning family. The herders of those days were the younger boys and girls who grazed the sheep on the outskirts of the towns. The father or, often, the mother clipped the fleece from the sheep's back. Grandmothers brought most valuable experience to the washing and carding of the wool which prepared it for the spinning wheel and the loom. In September 1851, John Taylor wrote: A larger company of woolen manufacturers will come from France next season, bringing with them all necessary machinery and the best of sheep, all of which are necessary. In 1849, there was established a carding machine on Mill Creek. The first rolls, made by Amasa Russell on this machine, were spun into yarn by women and woven into cloth on the old hand looms. In March 1851, the Territorial Legislature appropriated two thousand dollars for the benefit of the woolen mills which, the next year, turned out flannels, linseys, jeans, and yarn for knitting. It is said that Russell's Mill, the machinery for which was brought to Utah by Brigham Young, was the first woolen mill on the Pacific slope. Another woolen mill was established at West Jordan in April 1853, as reported in The Deseret News. The decade of the fifties saw considerable progress in the development of the wool industry due to the mill facilities. 'The machinery for these mills was often conveyed by ox teams to its destination. The wool industry has always been of immense importance to the people of Utah, from the days when our pioneer grandmothers patiently retraced the path taken by the herd and carefully picked from the bushes the precious bits of wool left by the sheep in passing. In the consideration of the textile industries of Utah, one is impressed with the variety and excellence of the articles that were manufactured. They met the needs of the people and served them well. They were an example of the co-operative efforts of our pioneers resulting in real functioning power. That spirit will never die. It set the standard for all time and its message is as clear today as it was one hundred years ago. Far more than a great commercial need was met. It was the expression of real co-operation with a great social and spiritual background. It was the voice of a people crying in the words of the old folk school leader: "Of myself I am nothing all that I have all that I am, I owe to God and to my fellow men." Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. D. & C. 58:27-28. A Place in the Country V NEIGHBORS Ruby Scranton Jones [This is the fifth and final story in a series of five short-short stories  Ed.] ELLEN Martin climbed down from the stepladder with her bucket of peaches. She wiped the perspiration from her forehead on her sleeve as she walked over to empty the peaches into the basket. She had only three bushel baskets full to show for her afternoon's work, yet her arms and back ached and her feet felt like lead. But she musn't let John know. He worried over having her do what he called "man's work." John lay on a camp cot in the shade of the apple tree by the back porch. Ellen went over and took the cloth from his forehead. She wet it with cool water from the pump and put it back. She thought he looked even paler than when she had last changed it. He didn't open his eyes or speak, so she sat down on the bench beside him to rest a few minutes. John had got the job of painting the big barn down the road. Yesterday, when it was almost finished, he had been overcome by the heat, and Mr. Adams, the owner, had brought him home. Ellen had been frightened, but Mr. Adams had insisted that plenty of salt and rest were all he needed. But he didn't seem to be getting better. He had _ eaten nothing and had been too listless to move. Ellen took hold of his wrist. His pulse was still too weak to count. He'd never be able to take the fruit to the store tomorrow. Why, oh, why hadn't she learned to drive the car! And, if John didn't get his money till the barn was finished, how were they ever going to make the September payment on the place. What would happen, she wondered, if they didn't make it. It was in the contract, of course, but she had been so sure that all their troubles would be over as soon as they got to the country that she hadn't paid much attention. But she wasn't ready to give up. She'd think of other ways to make money. She seemed to see the year stretching before her, not as a series of months, but as twelve monthly payments gathered together in dollars and dimes as though they were weeks and days. Ellen wanted to cry, she was so worried and so tired. She felt desperately lonely, too. Not a woman except clerks in stores had spoken to her in the six weeks since she had arrived. She had so hoped to make friends. "Ah, well!" she sighed, getting up to go back to her picking, "maybe I expected too much. Maybe they just don't like city people." When she was back on the ladder, Betty called to her. She looked down and saw the Hawkins boy with her two children. "Hello," she called. He smiled shyly and held up a sack of fresh corn. "Mother sent this," he explained. "She said you weren't here in time to plant any." Page 595
"How nice." Ellen said, getting down from the ladder again. "We like corn so much and we've never had it just picked before."
The boy still stood after she had taken the corn, scuffing his bare feet in the dust. "She said I should help you with the peaches," he muttered, "while Mr. Martin is sick."
Ellen could hardly believe her ears. After the chicken episode, the Hawkins family were the last people on earth from whom she would have expected help. "Help me?" she queried, "pick peaches, you mean?"
"Yes," he said, "I could come tomorrow." He turned then and ran towards home.
Well, Ellen thought to herself as she climbed back, and for some reason she didn't feel quite so tired and the bucket seemed to fill without so much effort.
A half hour later, Johnny called, "Mummie, see who's coming?"
Ellen peered through the leaves and saw a car coming up the driveway. Slowly she got down, knowing she had never looked worse in her life. Her hands were stained, her face streaked. Her head was tied in a red bandanna, and she felt dirty all over. The children weren't cleaned up either. And she had planned to have things so nice for her first callers. It took all the courage she possessed to walk over to the car that had stopped by the back porch.
"Mr. Adams got out. "I brought the missis," he said. "How's John today?"
Ellen took Mrs. Adams' hand and looked into the kindest of blue eyes.
Before getting out, Mrs. Adams
reached for a basket on the back seat. "I brought you some fresh bread and a jar of strawberry jam," she said.
Suddenly Ellen's eyes filled with tears, and she wiped them un-ashamedly. "Everyone is so kind," she murmured, and forgot to apologize for her appearance.
They went over to the cot then, and Ellen got chairs from the kitchen. John sat up and smiled, and Ellen noticed that his eyes looked more natural. Mr. Adams handed him a check, as he said, "I thought you might need this. You can finish the barn after it gets cool this fall. But do hurry and get well, for the missus is expecting you to paint the kitchen. We sure needed a handy man around here."
"Thanks," John spoke gratefully, folded the check and put it in his shirt pocket. "I'll be all right next week."
The children, with the puppy, came from their playhouse in the orchard. Betty's fair hair was a tangled mass, and the knees of Johnny's overalls were worn through, but Ellen couldn't help but be proud of them, anyway. She introduced them, "Elizabeth, John Junior, and 'Curtains'."
"Well, now," Mr. Adams observed, lifting Johnny to his lap, "quite a family. But 'Curtains!' that's a funny name for a dog."
"It's just a joke," Johnny answered, and all the Martin family laughed.
"Seems to be a family joke," Mr. Adams laughed with them. "You know, that's the nice thing about children, that they can have nicknames nobody else understands."
"Mrs. Adams smiled at Betty. A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY "You're about the age of my grand- daughter. You must get acquainted so you can go on the school bus together this fall. Shall I send her over to play sometime?" "Oh, yes," Betty replied eagerly, her thin face lighting up. "She has some kittens. Maybe your mother will let you have one." "Oh, yes," Betty said again. "We need a kitten 'cause we have mice." They all laughed as though that were a joke, too. When Mr. Adams got up to leave, he offered, "I see you have some peaches ready. I'll take them to 597 market tomorrow and every day till John is well."  Ellen sat a long time after they had gone, holding John's hand. At last she said, "I'm not afraid or lonely any more. We have neighbors and friends. Oh, John! I'm so glad we came." "Sure," he said. He turned on his side and closed his eyes. "I think I'll have a nap, and then I'll be ready for a good supper." Ellen was humming when she went back to her work. UNION FORT MONUMENT Salt Lake County, Utah Dorothy J. Roberts Dedicated by President George Albert Smith July 3, 1947 Today no feathered arrows fly Around a mud-chinked parapet. Only the old trees face the sky With rusty pod and fine-leafed fret.

CHARITY: Why is it that women have so little charity for one another?.... The God who measures our charities is able to look beyond the action to the motive which first prompted that action. In his eye, the widow's mite counted for much, simply because it was given freely.... Giving our goods is only one way of showing that we possess charity. To me, it seems that generous sympathy, freely expressed in time of sickness or trouble, where no material help is needed, will be accounted to us for charity.  Emma M. Myers.

The granaries and the storehouses of our country are overflowing with the bounty of fields and orchards. We see once more the evidence that the earth is good, that it will provide for the Physical needs of the people. Gratitude for food, and the opportunity for storing it against a time of need, should be unbounded, particularly at this time when there is so much hunger in the world. We should not think, however, that the abundance which we enjoy is entirely a result of the richness of our land, its sunlight and soil and rainfall, our civil liberties, Public schools, free assemblies, our press, our churches  4s a natural consequence of the inherent wealth of our Nation, The greatest riches of any country lie in the character of its people and in the type of government which they establish and support. On the 17th of September, 1787, one of the most important documents of all time was completed. Page 600 The Constitution of the United States was ready to be submitted to the states for their consideration, Capable and patriotic Statesmen, realizing the magnitude of their task, had worked untiringly to formulate an instrument which might direct the building of a �More perfect union," This document, destined to be-come "the tree of liberty," emphasized and guaranteed fundamental rights of individuals. Thus the founding fathers based the structure of t he new federation upon the ancient principle that men are free because God has given them freedom and free agency. During 160 years of testing, the Constitution of the United States has weathered many storms. In times of peaceful development, and in times of crisis, patriotic citizens have spoken of their Constitution as a living document of greatest value. Devout and grateful people have appreciated it as a standard "to which the wise and honest can repair." Today? there are some who not only profess no allegiance to the Constitution, but seek to supplant its provisions with the tenets of another social order. They speak of the Constitution as an outmoded instrument, no longer capable of protecting certain groups against exploitation by others. A dangerous division in ideals and loyalties is becoming increasingly apparent, and many people are using their privileges as citizens to work against the very EDITORIAL 601 instrument which guarantees them free speech and free endeavor.
As Latter-day Saints we have been given prophetic enlightenment concerning the observance of law. Our presidents and leaders have emphasized our responsibility in giving undivided allegiance to our country and its lawful institutions. Let us, today, live in accordance with the
words of the Prophet Joseph Smith which he offered as part of the dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple in 1836, in which he voiced this hope for the Nation:
Have mercy, O Lord, upon the rulers of the land; may those principles which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever.
�V. P. C.
