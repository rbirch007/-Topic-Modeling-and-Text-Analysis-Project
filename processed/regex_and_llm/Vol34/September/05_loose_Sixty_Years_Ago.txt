sixty years ago this September. ) Alice Morrey Bailey These are simple words that all may read  A land's majestic law, a free man's creed Supreme in power and liberty, distilled From patriot's blood that flowed at York, and spilled At Brandywine. The warning hoofs yet beat On Concord's roads; still sounds the fiery heat Of orators within these cadences. Here God-given rights, the premises Of man, are prime his right of speech And worship, to assemble, to impeach. None is slave, and none of titled note, He stands secure in ownership. In secret vote His is the right of choice, and he may rise Above his lot in birth by enterprise. His laws of life and trade are just and fair, Bound in this document of answered prayer. The sovereign states are one beneath its arch; Behind these deathless words, the people march. The Cover: "Reflections' Photograph taken in Manti National Forest, Utah, by Grace T. Kirton.
