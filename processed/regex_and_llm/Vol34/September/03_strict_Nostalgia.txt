NOSTALGIA
Myrtle Dean
The ceaseless throng moves down the busy street; Planes, droning in the sky with tireless wings, Defy earth noises, and drown the sound of feet. I walk with them, yet loneliness still clings.
Instead of all this clamor, I can hear The call of meadow larks, the sound of rain Upon a cottage roof; I see you, dear, Walk down the path and take my hand again;
NOTES TO THE FIELD Annual Relief Society General Conference THE annual Relief Society general conference will convene Wednesday, October 1, and Thursday, October 2, 1947, on Temple Square, Salt Lake City. Departmental sessions will be held Wednesday morning and afternoon for stake and mission officers and board members to consider the educational courses, secretarial work, and TheWednesday evening, a Singing Mothers Concert will be presented in the Tabernacle for the general public, as a feature of the Utah Centennial celebration. Thursday morning, an Officers' Meeting will be held in the Assembly Hall for stake and mission officers and board members. The standing roll call, and President Belle S. Spafford's official instructions will be given at this meeting. A general session to which the general public is invited will be held in the Tabernacle, Thursday afternoon from 2:00 to 4:00 P. M. Stake and mission officers and board members will be the guests of the General Board of Relief Society at a reception on Thursday evening in the Lafayette Ballroom, Hotel Utah. It is hoped that every stake will have at least one representative present at the general Relief Society conference and that as many missions as possible will be represented. Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 2, 1947 CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on Fast Sunday evenings, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evening of November 2d. Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding ward Relief Society conferences at this time. It is recommended: 1. That each ward conference be attended by a representative of the stake Page 602 board who should be present at both the officers' meeting and the general session. 2. That each conference consist of two meetings: a. An officers' meeting to be attended by the ward executive officers, special workers, and class leaders, the ward bishop or his representative, and the visiting stake board member. B. A general session for all Relief Society members and for the general membership of the ward. A suggestive program for use at ward conferences will be sent to ward and stake presidents in bulletin form. Where Trails Run Out Anna Prince Redd CHAPTER 8 [The incidents of this story are true, and the characters authentic. The information has been carefully gleaned from diaries, journals, and personal interviews. Ed.]. Synopsis: A company of twenty-four young men and two families James L. Davis, his wife Mary, and their four children; Henry H. Harriman, his wife Elizabeth, and their five children are called to explore a route from Cedar City, in Southern Utah, to San Juan County. The two families are to remain in San Juan and prepare for the coming of the main company. The purpose of the mission is to cultivate and maintain peaceful and friendly relations with the Indians. While driving her team at night, across a sultry, menacing desert, Elizabeth has a frightening experience with a mysterious Indian. She feels that she will see the Indian again and that he will know if she needs help. The company, after much suffering, finally reaches Moenkopi. The Davis family remains there and the others go on toward the San Juan. Peogament, the Indian chief, continually opposes the company and causes trouble and delay, but finally, the travelers reach the San Juan. Scouts return to Moenkopi and report the arrival of the Harrimans on the San Juan. The James L. Davis family and the scouts leave to join the Harrimans. Pearcon, a renegade Piute, and his band block the trail into the wilderness. VIDENTLY, Pearcon and his renegade Piutes had not seen the young cowboy leave the camp of the scouts, for they came back almost immediately, threatening vengeance for the wound the dog had inflicted in Pearcon's leg. Yet they were obviously careful not to bring on open warfare. Content to make things as unpleasant as possible, they went swaggering about the camp, demanding this and that as pay for the dog bite. Then, suddenly, a new figure appeared on the scene. Riding down from the knoll west of the camp, came an Indian, evidently a chief, for Pearcon cowered at sight of him and began limping off, followed by his friends. The big chief called to him, imperatively, to come back, and Pearcon returned sulkily, exaggerating his limp. Seeing that James was the oldest one of the white men, the Indian addressed him respectfully, telling Pearcon's angry followers to sit down. Then seeing the blood on Pearcon's leg, an angry scowl crossed his face, and he turned to the white man for an explanation. Speaking quickly, James called to his son to come and explain what had happened. In clear and simple words, Ted told the chief, in his own tribal language, how Pearcon had behaved. As a result, the chief had Pearcon sit on a high rock for a conference, and gave him a chance to answer the charges of the white men. Pearcon, in his turn, silently pointed to his leg. He then told how he had come into the camp to have fun with the white boys and said he was only fooling, but that the white men had become angry and had set the dog on him. It was he, the proud Pearcon, who had been mistreated! Had not the white man's dog bitten Pearcon on the leg? Page 603 604 Clearly puzzled, the chief told James the white scouts would have to pay for the dog bite. That was Indian justice. It would help to win Pearcon's friendship. Much as the scouts disliked doing so, they gave Pearcon some money, a pair of shoes, and a belt. He accepted the payment, but demanded young Smith's ax also, as being the weapon the white man had started to use against him. The chief told James that Pearcon should have the name James didn't like the way matters were going, but he felt that they must play for time. He knew Pearcon would use the ax and the bite on his leg to get his friends to come to his aid when he wanted revenge, and so he offered Pearcon more money and another ax, but Pearcon refused the offer. James thereupon gave Pearcon the ax he wanted, but asked the chief to send Pearcon and his friends away so there would not be any more trouble. James pointed to his wagon, and had Ted tell the chief that a sick squaw was in it, and they must go on to a doctor, a white medicine man. After a long parley, the chief sent Pearcon and his men away, telling them he was pleased with the white men's payment for the trouble. Pearcon went grudgingly back to his camp., 'he chief, however, warned the scouts to be on their guard against Pearcon. He, the great chief, would do all he could to help the white men. 'They must sit down there until sunup, or Pearcon would wax brave and attack them. With the coming of the sun, Pearcon would be afraid of the sun-god, and the white men would be safe. It was a long, vigilant night. Every preparation was made for an attack. Mary lay, fully dressed, wide-eyed in the dark, listening to every twig that cracked, to every breath she and the children drew, praying that it would not be their last. AYLIGHT came, and no Indians. Sunup, and still no Indians. The scouts sighed with relief. Pearcon had not attacked in the night, and now, when the sun was high, he would be afraid, for the sun-god would see his bad acts and tell the Great Spirit. Mary came out of her wagon and washed the children and combed their hair while Ted and James cooked breakfast. While they were eating, there came a strange, long call. 'The men leaped to their feet in consternation. Was it Pearcon? Had he decided to avenge himself in the daylight? Drawing their guns, they stood waiting. Ted Davis led his mother to her wagon and stood beside it, his heart beating against his nbs with the violence of a trip hammer. The call was repeated, a long, cold, faraway cry, that yet seemed strangely near. Ted's eyes lighted up. "Pa," he cried, "I think I know why Pearcon did not attack last night. While I was in Moenkopi, the Indian boys told me of a human spirit that goes over the country doing good deeds. 'They said the Indians were afraid of the spirit, for none had ever seen it. They had only heard it call. And always the call came when bad Indians were making the Great Spirit angry." "That is so," Seth Tanner agreed. "I have heard the story whispered United States Geological Survey "MOST BEAUTIFUL OF BRIDGES" Rainbow Bridge, Utah The Latter-day Saint pioneers, on their journey into the Indian country, passed near this famous natural bridge, which, at that time, had never been seen by white men. After dark. I have waited many times, hoping to hear the call, but it never came." He scanned the horizon, but when he could see nothing, he concluded that, as usual, the mystic figure would remain a tradition, and sat down to his meal. Before the meal was finished, a tall, strange Indian appeared suddenly in camp. He walked straight up to James Davis and greeted him. James looked around for Ted to tell him what was wanted, but the Indian said in plain English: "White man take squaw and papooses and go in wagon. Long way he must go. I will ride with him." The men looked at each other suspiciously, thinking the Indian was leading them into a trap. James studied the Indian thoughtfully. He was tall and very straight, neither young nor old. In his eyes was a wise kindliness.. His whole bearing was one of poise and dignity. "A man above his kind," James thought, and felt impelled to extend his hand. He controlled the impulse, however, and, looking squarely at the Indian, inquired, "You friend?" The Indian looked at him in surprise, but said nothing. "What are you goin' to do, Pa?" Ted asked. "Let Ma say what we should do. It's Ma we care about." "I'm prompted to go, Son," James Davis replied, "and I'll follow that prompting. Get the teams to the wagons." To the Indian he said: "We will "? Go. Ill with worry and fatigue, Mary had sat listening to their voices. She had not seen the Indian, but, at the sound of his voice, she seemed to be home again, safe, happy in her own dooryard, waiting for James and Ted to come from work. She sat for a time, trying to fix the illusion in her mind. When James asked, "You friend?" the certainty that this strange Indian had helped them before, became sure in her memory. She smiled and waited for her husband's answer. Yes, she thought, when she heard James say that they would go, James was prompted.... God is guiding us.... WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT BEFORE Ted had the last tug hitched to the singletrees, the Indian was on the wagon seat. "Toweenie," he shouted. "Fast!" James cracked his whip and the team sprang forward, but were jerked to a stop when the wagon wheels, almost buried in sand, could not turn. Digging with their hands, the scouts cleared a trench and gave the wheels a hard push that sent them whirring out along the trail. The Indian stood up in the seat and, shading his eyes from the sun, looked the country over anxiously. Then, apparently satisfied with what he saw or failed to see he sat down again. "To 'hadena," he cried, and grabbing the whip from James' hand, he lashed at the team. The horses lunged forward, slowed to a brisk trot and held the pace. Mile after mile they went, not stopping. Every time the team slowed at all, the Indian jumped to the seat to scan the horizon. The pantomime was repeated for ten or fifteen miles, until the horses could go no further. The Indian leaped upon the seat and made another careful study of the landscape. Then he jumped to the ground. "It is good," he said. "Pearcon's land is far behind. You go slow now. Indian custom say one Indian not attack on another Indian's claim. It is a very strict law. Pearcon is bad. He is showing his leg to all the mean Indians around. And the ax is making them very mad. He says he will get many Indians and kill white men. I come. White man now safe." James looked at the Indian and solemnly offered his hand. 607 The Indian took the white man's hand and shook it awkwardly. "You not know me?" "Where you see me?" James asked in surprise. "No savvy." "Cedar City," the Indian answered proudly. "Your squaw, my friend. Many times I come to house for cheese. I listen to Indian talk. I come to help white squaw." "White man and Indian eat together now?" James asked. "Tt is good," the Indian stated solemnly. "Will white man's Mary be well to cook?" United States Geological Survey THE "HOLE IN THE ROCK" The main company of the San Juan pioneers took their wagons down this deep and narrow chasm to the Colorado River. "She will cook for our friend," James answered.
There was a broad smile on the Indian's face, and he promptly went to sleep in the sand, his face uncovered to the sun.
In the wagon, Mary whispered, "thank thee, Lord. He even remembers my name."
At dinner time, James presented the stately Indian to the scouts in a very formal manner, and they shook hands quite as solemnly. He ate heartily, thanked Mary with his best smile, and rode over the hill into the sunset.
"He came, he asked no reward, and he is gone," Mary said regretfully. "There are but few men like him."
THE next ten days of the hard journey were slow and uneventful. Then, one night they camped at a place called Gulch Creek, and saw an animal whose existence they would have questioned, had they not seen it themselves. A cross between a sheep and a goat, the animal stood four feet high, had six large horns, and was covered with a mixture of yellowish wool and hair.
"What a critter," James Davis exclaimed. "How in the name of common sense did it come to exist?"
"The Indians at Moenkopi told me about this place, Pa," Ted cried excitedly. "They say it's the water of Gulch Creek that does it. I used to laugh at the kids when they'd tell me such wild stories. But gosh, it's true!"
"How do they account for it, Ted?"
"They say that when a goat and a sheep drink together out of this creek, a new animal is born!"
"It's funny," the children cried. "We want to take it with us!"
"We can't, unless we leave you kids here," Ted teased.
"Now, my boy Ted, you stop teasing the children," James admonished. "Let's be glad there is one thing to laugh about on this long journey. It will be something to tell your grandchildren."
"And they won't believe it, Papa," Steven-old Emily said sagely, "cause we don't either."
FOURTEEN days later the company reached the San Juan river. They crossed it at Montezuma Ford, just inside the Utah line, in the extreme southeast corner of San Juan County.
Mary cried, knowing that the nightmare trip was ended.
"Well, here we are," James shouted. "Look across the river! There are our folks. There are the scouts in a band coming to meet us!"
"James," Mary cried in dismay, "it's a terrible place! We can't stop here. There isn't a single house�not even an Indian camp!"
"It's good land," James reassured her. "We'll make a good place of it. Mary darlin'. Just you wait and see."
"You can talk, James Davis," Mary stormed, "talk just like men always do. But you're not the one that's going to have a little helpless baby, right here in the sand and sage. I can't stand it, James. I can't stand it!"
"There, Mary, my darlin', don't cry," James pleaded. "Let me get you across the river to Elizabeth Harriman. You need a woman's shoulder to cry upon."
At Elizabeth's name, Mary smiled, even while sobs were still shaking her. "I want to see Elizabeth," she cried. "Let's hurry and cross the river."
"My boy Ted, where are you?" James called. "You come and drive your mother's wagon across the ford."
"I-I will do nothing of the kind, James Davis," Mary scolded, indignant at the mere suggestion that she could not drive across the river herself. "I've driven this wagon every inch of the way from Cedar City, and no one is taking the job away from me now!"
Ted looked at his father, caught the gleam of fun in his eyes, and backed away, brushing the tears from his own eyes. "I guess Ma's the boss," he said proudly. "She can beat us at driving any day!"
Mary drove across the ford and up the slippery bank, letting the horses lunge ahead without direction, for she was calling to Elizabeth, who was running along, beside the wagon, laughing and crying, "Oh, Mary, it's wonderful that you are here!"
Mary swung her wagon expertly into position beside that of Elizabeth. The moment the team was stopped, Elizabeth was up and over the wagon wheel, so she and Mary could cry together.
The Montezuma scouts gathered around the Davis wagon, greeting everyone affectionately, shaking the hands of the scouts who had come in with them.
Photograph by Dr. Walter P. Cottam ARCH CANYON, A TYPICAL GORGE OF THE SAN JUAN COUNTRY 610 WORKING unitedly, the scouts built two, one-room log cabins for Mary and Elizabeth and their children. There were no doors to hang, but there was a small window fitted with panes of glass for each house. The women had seen to that, carrying the frames in their wagons, packed with their best dishes and quilts. "We can make our own doors," James told Henry Harriman, "and as soon as we get settled, I'll build us each a big fireplace." Ever since the main party of scouts had arrived at Montezuma settle. Ment (as the place was called by them) they had worked tirelessly, building dams in the River, digging ditches to carry water to the home. Steads, plowing acres and acres of land, and planting it in corn and wheat and oats. They had explored the country for miles around, and felt that now the two families were housed they should go home as quickly as they could. Most of them hoped secretly that they wouldn't have to return to Montezuma when the main company came. They had built hundreds of miles of road to the new mission, and felt that their job was done. Seeing that dissatisfaction was growing, President Smith released those who wished to go, telling them to return by a northern route, by way of the Blue Mountains of San Juan, through the scattered settlements of central Utah and down through Salina Canyon to their homes. He and his sons, and a few others, would stay on until Mrs. Davis' baby was born and she was well again. Those who accepted the release were to wait at the Blue Mountains until President Smith could join them there. They were to explore the country and be ready to make a report of their findings. Six miles up the river lived some Prospectors, a Mr. And Mrs. Mitchell, and two men who posed as tra pers, but who were really looking for a fabulous, lost gold mine. James hired Mrs. Mitchell to come to Montezuma and be with Mary during her confinement, since, except for Mary and Elizabeth, she was the only other woman within sixty-five miles. "She's a good woman, but no midwife," James confided to Elizabeth. "I'm worried, but it is the best we can do," From the moment that confinement began, Mary was very ill. "She's awful sick, Mr. Davis," Mrs. Mitchell said, coming to the door, exhausted from the long hours of anxiety and work. "I got to go huntin' herbs. And maybe I'll not find the kind I want. I dunno what more I kin do, Mr. Davis. I guess the pore girl's a gonna die." James would have protested, but Elizabeth silenced him, waiting for Mrs. Mitchell to leave the yard. Then she said: "I'm glad to get that woman out of the house. We can Pray now, James. Not that we haven't done before, but President Smith can do more at that than we can." Silas went humbly to Marty's bed, and, laying his hands upon her head, he asked God to deliver the child and spare the mother's life. Standing beside the bed, James, Ted, Henty, Elizabeth, and George silently repeated the prayer, faith their only weapon against death. (To be continued ) Selected Data Annual Report 1946 Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary Treasurer THIS report represents activities and accomplishments of the Relief Societies through-out the Church during 1946. While it records activities for just one  year, we are pleased to publish it during this very significant year of 1947 � Utah's Centennial' because the achievements shown here are the culmination of the labors of R lief Society women during the hundred years that Utah has been the home of the Society. Relief Society meetings were suspended in 1844 due to the persecution of the saints in Nauvoo and subsequent migration to the West, so that when the pioneers arrived in Utah the assets of the Society consisted of the precious "Book of Records" in the keeping of the first secretary, Eliza R. Snow, and, more  precious still, the spirit and ideals of the Society carried in the hearts of the pioneer women. After arrival in Utah, the overwhelming task of providing the bare necessities of life absorbed most of the time and energy of every able-bodied man and woman, so that formal Relief Society meetings were not held until these pressing needs were satisfied. In the absence of formal meetings the ideals of the Society were carried forward by the women through individual ministration to the needy and ill. Early in the settlement of Utah, President Brigham Young called Eliza R. Snow to assist the bishops in organizing Relief Societies, and, as early as 1851, there were organizations in a few wards in Salt Lake City and nearby communities. In December 1867, President Brigham Young, recognizing the blessings that had come to the sisters and to the Church membership generally through Relief Society, instructed the bishops to organize Societies in all the wards of the Church. From this beginning, Relief Society has grown steadily until it now has a membership of 105,598 and financial assets of $1,616,098.51. While we are proud to report these tangible assets, the spiritual and cultural development that has come to the many thousands of women who have been associated with Relief Society during this past century, and blessings that have come to those thousands more who have been encouraged and helped by its compassionate and welfare service, are intangible assets that never can be shown in a statistical report. We are grateful to the women who kept Relief Society alive through their individual devotion to its ideals during the time the Church was seeking a permanent home; we are grateful to those early leaders who guided the Society through its formative period; and we are grateful to the leaders of its more mature years, who not only perpetuated the worthy objectives of the Society, but whose vision and devotion expanded its sphere of influence and service to the far corners of the earth. We love and honor Utah as the home in which Relief Society was nurtured until it attained the strength and stature which enabled it to go forth and spread its benefactions throughout the civilized world. The following pages portray the record of service and achievement of the Society in the first full calendar year of post-war adjustment. We are pleased to include the reports of several European missions that had not reported since 1938 due to war conditions. Illustrated by Dorothy Piatt Handley Page 601 
Membership
FOR the first time since 1942, the report shows a gratifying increase in membership in the stakes and missions. There were 4,107 members added to the rolls of Relief Societies in the stakes and 1,105 are in the missions. This increase is due partly to the work of the former Relief Society members returning to their homes from employment in war industries, and to renewed efforts in enlisting members. The General Board extends sincere thanks to all whose efforts brought about this substantial increase. The goal the Relief Society continues to be the enrollment of every Latter-day Saint woman as a member whether or not she can attend the meetings. Since it is assumed that there is at least one woman eligible for membership in each family of the Church, there are still 74,234 families in the stakes not represented in Relief Society. The missions exceeded the goal by having 1.1 persons in each family enrolled in the Society.
The 1946 report of the General Relief Society, assignments to positions of leadership in various phases of the program provide added development for a majority of the members. The accompanying chart shows the distribution of positions of responsibility among the members.

Visiting Teaching SERVICE
THE General Board deeply appreciates the very heartening reports which visiting teaching attained to in all stakes during 1946. This was brought about through visiting teacher conventions held in many of the stakes throughout the Church, through the personal enthusiasm and interest of the stake and ward presidents who are responsible for the visiting teaching program, and by the devotion and service of the visiting teachers themselves.
There were 527 visiting teacher districts created in 1946, and 646 additional visiting teacher meetings were held. Monthly friendly visits increased 97,533 and were even in excess of national 1,024 visiting teaching during 1946.
Communications made by mail or telephone in lieu of visits decreased 7,626 or 30.03%. It is expected that these communications will continue to decrease now that travel facilities are available for making personal visits to the homes.

Compassionate SERVICE
THE care of the sick and the needy is fundamental to Relief Society and has received time and attention of thousands of members from its beginning.
Visits to the sick and homebound increased 2,975 or 2.50% and the number of days' care of the sick decreased .26% or 2.07%.
The decrease in 1946 is attributed to the General Board's re-emphasis of the rule that 8 hours of service constitute one day's care, and to the further fact that nursing services and hospital care are more available since the close of the war.
The marked decrease (88 or 48.08%) in the number of complete preparations for burial indicates a wider use of mortuaries. The decrease (569 or 24.35%) in the number of bodies dressed for burial shows that this sacred service is being extended. Assistance at funerals decreased slightly (.65%).
