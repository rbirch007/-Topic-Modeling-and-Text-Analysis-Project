Always a Frontier Christie Lund Coles SOPHRONIA tried for the third time to thread the needle. For the third time the slim point of thread missed the small, mocking eye. Her hand trembled; it was no use. She laid it down on the table near the hallway while she had been sewing, put her hand over her eyes, pressing hard, trying to shut out her weariness and the innumerable things that she had to do.
Nana's dress must be finished for the dress rehearsal of the pageant tomorrow night; her own radio talk on the frontier woman must be made letter perfect (she had barely started it); John's suit must be taken to the tailor; his shirts and Tom's must be done up. She had promised Tom she would go with him to see a used car he wanted to buy. There was the cake to bake for the Bazaar Wednesday, and guests coming for over the Twenty-fourth. And . . . oh, but there was the telephone again. Something jerked inside of her. If it rang once more . . . just once, she would scream.
As she walked toward the telephone she knew why it had been so difficult to finish her speech. It was hard to feel pity or understanding for the pioneer woman who had so much peace and none of the distractions and nerve-wracking worries that she herself seemed to have. Her grandmother's children had stayed safely home, no seventeen-year-old boy had wanted to race dangerously about in a convertible coupe. No daughter had rushed to this and that
as the Centennial queen's attendant, admired and courted. No phone had jangled, no radio or phonograph had blared, no insistent doorbell had had to be answered.
She sighed deeply as she took the receiver from its hook, then said, "Hello," as pleasantly as possible.
She was relieved to hear her husband's deep, resonant voice saying, "Hello, Sophie? How's everything?"
"All right, I suppose," she told him, wondering what new chore he had in mind for her.
"You know," he went on, "I was just sitting here watching the people in pioneer costumes go by. I got to thinking how nice it would be to drive out and see Grandfather Shortys old place just as part of the celebration. Would you like to do that this afternoon?"
She wanted to laugh loudly, hysterically. Instead, she managed to say, "Oh, John, it would be lovely, but I really haven't time."
"It's a nice day for a picnic, Sophronia, you and I haven't had a picnic alone for a long time. Come on�let things go."
There was an almost boyish insistence in his voice, a persuasiveness that she could not resist. She thought swiftly: she could finish up the dress tonight or in the morning; she could take a pencil and paper along and might get an idea or two for her talk. She was much too on the ragged and irritable edge to do much here, anyway. It might do her good.
He was repeating, "Well, what do
ALWAYS A FRONTIER you say? Shall I pick you up in half an hour?" "Yes. Yes, do that, John dear. I'll be ready." She hurriedly slipped into a clean print dress and went to the kitchen to make a few sandwiches, a salad, and a thermos bottle of lemonade. As she was putting a dish towel over the basket, her daughter, brown and straight, and utterly lovely, walked in. "Hi, Mom," she greeted her mother, "what are you up to?" "Your father and I are taking a lunch out to the old farm." "But I was hoping you would press my white skirt while I bathed. We're playing tennis." "It's too hot for tennis. Besides, if you want your dress finished for tomorrow night you had better do a little on the basting. You can sew as well as I can." She didn't mean to sound abrupt, but her daughter looked at her in surprise, protesting, "But, Mother." "There's your father now. If Tom comes in tell him to take your father's suit to the cleaners. Sure now. Goodbye, darlin'." The girl's surprise seemed to grow as she answered, "Goodbye. Have a nice time." Sophronia and her husband drove down the country road, away from the city's rush and heat, her tenseness seemed to gradually leave her. She leaned her head on the seat, sang snatches of song. "Oh, it is beautiful out here, isn't it?" she asked. "I imagine it was fun living here." "Not much fun I'd say, the way grandmother had it," her husband answered, "it was a hard life." 587 Irritation rose in her again. She wanted to protest, to say she had heard Grandmother Storey tell about it. She wanted to cry out, "I'd like to see her take just one day of mine. Just one." It was by sheer will that she was silent, that she smiled at him as he assisted her from the car. When they had finished their lunch and rested awhile in the tall grass, her husband told her, "I think I�ll walk down through the fields, see the canal where we used to swim. Want to come along?" "No. Lying here in the shade seems too good to me. You go." "Sure you won't be lonesome?" She laughed, "Quite, quite sure." She was eager to have him gone that she might close her eyes, soak in the silence and the cooling air, the sound of meadow lark and blue jay. It would be so restful. And it was. Yet, when after what seemed like hours, she looked at her watch and found that only half an hour had passed, she got up and looked around her, at the small rock house, the well set back a hundred yards or more from the house. She could still hear the little old lady who had been John's grandmother saying, "We were lucky to have a well, though I usually carried my wash water from the canal." Sophie could see the blackened bricks still forming part of a circle where grandmother had done her washings winter and summer for ten children, where she had boiled lye and grease to make soap. Sophie saw the long rows of deserted garden which the little lady had said were hers to weed and plant, since the men folks had too much else to do. Oh, it hadn't been easy. Sophie admitted that. 588 GHE walked into the house and shrank a little from the musty darkness of the place, the small rooms, the few, small windows, the remains of a blackened fireplace in which had been done most of the cooking. She stood in what had been the parlor, listened for a sound, a car, a step, a neighbor, but there was nothing but utter silence, deep and stark and unutterably lonely, on all sides of her. She rushed outside, looked anxiously to the west for John. There was no sight of him, so she sat down again in the tall grass and began writing a few notes for her talk. In the distance she heard what must have been the sound of a dog, though for a moment she shuddered, fearing it might be a coyote or some wild animal stalking near, hungry and: vicious. 'That fear, too, must have been with Grandmother Storey on nights when her husband had gone to the city for supplies, and she was alone with her helpless brood. Another hour passed. It seemed eternities. Oh, she couldn't have borne this silence and this isolation, this being cut off from the whole world, working from dawn to dark, no music, no friends. She saw John, then, coming through the fields. He saw her and his step hurried, he waved. Her heart leaped at the sight of him, with love, with welcome and tenderness. Just so, the woman before her had watched for her man, been eager for his coming. She understood it all so well, now. It would never be easy for a woman and a mother. There would always be a frontier to face, to conquer, to rise above. Love was the dream no, the reality that made it all possible, that made the past good, the future full of hope. She could write her speech now. She could finish the dress. It would be fun to take the receiver from its hook and hear a friend say, "Hello," even to hear someone ask a favor. So good to help her children with their problems. How proud she was to be one in the long procession of women who were indomitable and unafraid, who were so richly blessed. She ran forward to meet her husband.
