Annual Report 1946 Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary Treasurer THIS report represents activities and accomplishments of the Relief Societies through-out the Church during 1946. While it records activities for just one  year, we are pleased to publish it during this very significant year of 1947 � Utah's Centennial' because the achievements shown here are the culmination of the labors of R lief Society women during the hundred years that Utah has been the home of the Society. Relief Society meetings were suspended in 1844 due to the persecution of the saints in Nauvoo and subsequent migration to the West, so that when the pioneers arrived in Utah the assets of the Society consisted of the precious "Book of Records" in the keeping of the first secretary, Eliza R. Snow, and, more  precious still, the spirit and ideals of the Society carried in the hearts of the pioneer women. After arrival in Utah, the overwhelming task of providing the bare necessities of life absorbed most of the time and energy of every able-bodied man and woman, so that formal Relief Society meetings were not held until these pressing needs were satisfied. In the absence of formal meetings the ideals of the Society were carried forward by the women through individual ministration to the needy and ill. Early in the settlement of Utah, President Brigham Young called Eliza R. Snow to assist the bishops in organizing Relief Societies, and, as early as 1851, there were organizations in a few wards in Salt Lake City and nearby communities. In December 1867, President Brigham Young, recognizing the blessings that had come to the sisters and to the Church membership generally through Relief Society, instructed the bishops to organize Societies in all the wards of the Church. From this beginning, Relief Society has grown steadily until it now has a membership of 105,598 and financial assets of $1,616,098.51. While we are proud to report these tangible assets, the spiritual and cultural development that has come to the many thousands of women who have been associated with Relief Society during this past century, and blessings that have come to those thousands more who have been encouraged and helped by its compassionate and welfare service, are intangible assets that never can be shown in a statistical report. We are grateful to the women who kept Relief Society alive through their individual devotion to its ideals during the time the Church was seeking a permanent home; we are grateful to those early leaders who guided the Society through its formative period; and we are grateful to the leaders of its more mature years, who not only perpetuated the worthy objectives of the Society, but whose vision and devotion expanded its sphere of influence and service to the far corners of the earth. We love and honor Utah as the home in which Relief Society was nurtured until it attained the strength and stature which enabled it to go forth and spread its benefactions throughout the civilized world. The following pages portray the record of service and achievement of the Society in the first full calendar year of post-war adjustment. We are pleased to include the reports of several European missions that had not reported since 1938 due to war conditions. Illustrated by Dorothy Piatt Handley Page 601 
Membership
FOR the first time since 1942, the report shows a gratifying increase in membership in the stakes and missions. There were 4,107 members added to the rolls of Relief Societies in the stakes and 1,105 are in the missions. This increase is due partly to the work of the former Relief Society members returning to their homes from employment in war industries, and to renewed efforts in enlisting members. The General Board extends sincere thanks to all whose efforts brought about this substantial increase. The goal the Relief Society continues to be the enrollment of every Latter-day Saint woman as a member whether or not she can attend the meetings. Since it is assumed that there is at least one woman eligible for membership in each family of the Church, there are still 74,234 families in the stakes not represented in Relief Society. The missions exceeded the goal by having 1.1 persons in each family enrolled in the Society.
The 1946 report of the General Relief Society, assignments to positions of leadership in various phases of the program provide added development for a majority of the members. The accompanying chart shows the distribution of positions of responsibility among the members.

Visiting Teaching SERVICE
THE General Board deeply appreciates the very heartening reports which visiting teaching attained to in all stakes during 1946. This was brought about through visiting teacher conventions held in many of the stakes throughout the Church, through the personal enthusiasm and interest of the stake and ward presidents who are responsible for the visiting teaching program, and by the devotion and service of the visiting teachers themselves.
There were 527 visiting teacher districts created in 1946, and 646 additional visiting teacher meetings were held. Monthly friendly visits increased 97,533 and were even in excess of national 1,024 visiting teaching during 1946.
Communications made by mail or telephone in lieu of visits decreased 7,626 or 30.03%. It is expected that these communications will continue to decrease now that travel facilities are available for making personal visits to the homes.

Compassionate SERVICE
THE care of the sick and the needy is fundamental to Relief Society and has received time and attention of thousands of members from its beginning.
Visits to the sick and homebound increased 2,975 or 2.50% and the number of days' care of the sick decreased .26% or 2.07%.
The decrease in 1946 is attributed to the General Board's re-emphasis of the rule that 8 hours of service constitute one day's care, and to the further fact that nursing services and hospital care are more available since the close of the war.
The marked decrease (88 or 48.08%) in the number of complete preparations for burial indicates a wider use of mortuaries. The decrease (569 or 24.35%) in the number of bodies dressed for burial shows that this sacred service is being extended. Assistance at funerals decreased slightly (.65%).
