FEBRUARY TABLE DECORATIONS Curving lines possess more beauty than straight lines. A vertical or horizontal line is more attractive if it is broken. Radiating lines in composition may be based on a triangle turned in different positions. Keep the size of your arrangements suitable to the surroundings. If your house is large, the flower groups may be sophisticated and W formal. If your house is small, simplify your arrangements, and make them informal. It is impossible to rival nature, so do not use too many flowers in one arrangement. Remember, whether large ol small, to keep your decorative designs simple. Oo]
