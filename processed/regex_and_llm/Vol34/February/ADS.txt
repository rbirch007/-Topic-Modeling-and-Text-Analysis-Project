Brigham Young University as a great Church university of higher learning. Today, in addition to the Brigham Young University, which has an enrollment of about 4,500 students, the Church operates twelve institutes of religion in connection with state universities and junior colleges, ninety-nine seminaries in connection with high schools, the Latter-day Saints Business College in Salt Lake City, Ricks Junior College at Rexburg, Idaho, and Juarez Academy at Juarez, Mexico. During the academic year 1944-1945, the last year for which complete statistics are available, these institutions, with 376 teachers, served 27,043 students. The Church leaders are so converted to the need of this educational work for the spiritual advancement of its membership that they appropriated more than one million dollars of Church funds for the maintenance of the department of education during the year 1945. Surely, no Church in proportion to its size has invested as heavily for the education of its members as has the restored Church. In addition to this formal education, the Church provides educational opportunities through the Priesthood and auxiliary organizations 137 of the Church. Lessons in Priesthood meeting, Relief Society, Sunday School, Primary, and Mutual Improvement Association classes give hundreds of thousands of members a chance for continued intellectual growth, even after school has been completed. Another phase of activity, in which the Church has been interested since its early days, is the recreational life of its membership. Latter-day Saints have never accepted the view, so commonly held by so many Christian denominations, that mortal life began in sin, and the body is therefore evil, while only the spirit is good. The restored Church teaches that life is good, and that both body and spirit should live joyfully and happily. "Men are that they might have joy," has come to be a maxim of the Latter-day Saint interpretation of earth life. But this joy is more than mere pleasure�it is interpreted to mean something akin to true happiness, resulting from good conduct, high idealism, and good ethical living, having lasting value, followed by no regrets. Early Church leaders were practical men of vision, who knew that relaxation was needed for a well-rounded personal development. At Nauvoo, the leaders of the Church encouraged the saints to participate in wholesome recreation, and _ set the example by taking part in stage plays. Dramatic productions were given during the trying years of the western exodus, and continued to be given in Utah. In time, the great Mutual Improvement Association and Primary organizations developed elaborate programs for the constructive use of leisure time. They provided recreation of all types, but arranged for it under ideal, wholesome conditions, wherein people, young and old, could have a good time in a proper way. The prayer offered at the dedication of the Salt Lake Theater, in 1862, contains a fine statement of the Church's attitude toward recreation: Suffer no evil or wicked influences to predominate or prevail within these walls; neither disorder, drunkenness, debauchery, or licentiousness of any sort or kind; but rather than this, let it utterly perish and crumble to atoms; let it be as though it had not been, an utter waste, each and every part returned to its natural element; but may order, virtue, cleanliness, sobriety, and excellence obtain and hold fast possession herein, the righteous possess it, and "Holiness to the Lord" be forever inscribed therein.... As the unstrung bow no longer retains its elasticity, strength and powers, so may Thy people who congregate here for recreation, unbend for a while from the sterner and more wearying duties of life (Pyper, Romance of an Old Playhouse, page 92). Today, the Church follows this philosophy of recreation. It offers through its auxiliary associations, recreational activities designed to care for the varied interests of all groups �music, handwork, athletics, debating, oral expression, drama, outdoor camps and vacation centers, scouting, art, social dancing, and creative interpretation. These are wholesome opportunities to "unbend for a while from the sterner and more wearying duties of life." Furthermore, many of these activities afford opportunity for intellectual and cultural growth. Mormon recreation has never been viewed as an end in itself, but as a means of relaxation, creative activity, and cultural or intellectual growth. What are the fruits of the educational and recreational programs of the Church? We have attained a high degree of leadership, with our people holding many positions of trust and responsibility in all parts of the world, in all types of human endeavor. We have a higher percentage of our young people completing high school than any other religious group in America, and the number of Latter-day Saints who attend college is more than twice the national average. Thousands of members trained in the schools and auxiliaries are today occupying positions of executive and spiritual leadership in the wards and stakes of the Church, and the organizations continue to grow. Our recreational program has been widely acclaimed throughout the nation, and has proved to be a strong deterrent of juvenile delinquency. These are fruits of which we can well be proud. Questions and Activity Problems 1. What do you think caused the Church in the days of its infancy to embark upon a vast educational program to train its members? 2. Have a class member present the educational expenditures for 1945 from the financial statement presented at April Conference, 1946. 3. What does recreation achieve in the life of the individual? 4. What are the fruits of Mormonism from the standpoint of its educational and recreational programs today? References Pyper, George D.: Romance of an Old Playhouse. Recreation in the Home, pp. 5-9.

Jacobs, Chairman For Tuesday, May 27, 1947 Objective: To point out that it is not enough to feel gratitude, but that it must be expressed in word and deed, if a lasting impression is to be made upon family members. I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. Psalm 9:1-2 SO David, one of the most beloved characters in the Old Testament, expressed his gratitude to God. Many of the psalms are revealing poems of praise and thanksgiving. (See Psalms 30, 63, 95, 98, 116, 145, 147, 148, 149, 150.) Cicero, the celebrated Roman author, orator, and philosopher once said: "Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues but the parent of all the others." Said another writer: "Blessed is any man or woman with a grateful heart." Outward expressions of gratitude are good for the soul. They bring joy and encouragement to the recipient and growth and happiness to the giver. Expressions of gratitude stimulate love and, if we have love in our hearts, we will have inner peace. Our countenances will be radiant, our thoughts will be affirmative and not negative. A whole lesson might be written on the effect of our thoughts upon our health. We read in Proverbs: "A merry heart doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit drieth up the bones." A modern writer, William George Jordan, in his book The Power of Truth, states that gratitude gives new life and energy to the individual from whom it emanates." We have all had well up within us, feelings of gratitude, and, though we may not be able to express our worshipful attitude in such lofty language as did David, the psalmist, we can feel as deep a sense of gratitude as he did, and we can translate - our thanks to God into the acts of our daily lives. It has been said that gratitude is love in action. Henry Drummond, in his worthwhile essay "The Greatest Thing in the World," claims that love, as analyzed by the Apostle Paul, in the thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians, is more to be desired than any other gift. If gratitude is love in action, we may apply all that Drummond says concerning this quality to that of gratitude: The business of our lives, is to have these things fitted into our characters. That is the supreme work to which we need to address ourselves in this world. Is life not full of opportunities for learning love? The world is not a playground; it is a school room. Life is not a holiday, but an education. And the one eternal lesson for us all is how better we can love. What makes a man a good artist, a good sculptor, a good musician? Practice. What makes a man a good linguist, a good stenographer? Practice. What makes a man a good man? Practice. Nothing else. If a man does not exercise his arm he develops no bicep muscles; and if a man does not exercise his soul, he acquires no muscle in his soul, no strength of character, no vigor of moral fibre nor beauty of spiritual growth. It is, therefore, plain that the chief concern of parents should be to provide their families with exercises in soul development. And, of these, none will contribute to greater beauty of spiritual growth than the habit of sincere expressions of gratitude through the acts of their daily lives. Politeness may be nothing more than gratitude expressed for trifles. Courtesy has been called love in little things. Carlyle said of Robert Burns that there was. No truer gentleman in Europe than the ploughman poet. "It was because he had gratitude in his heart for all things�the mouse, the daisy, and all things great and small that God had created." It is well for newly married couples to resolve to continue the little courtesies of their courtship days, since respect, admiration, and love must be fed if they are to grow. Otherwise, the everyday affairs of life may make it prosaic. The wife who notes the discontinuance of certain small acts of gallantry in her husband, such as helping her on with her coat, putting on her galoshes, may have omitted those simple words "thank you" following these small courtesies. It should not be inferred, however, that a husband or wife should feel neglected if small attentions are not constantly in evidence. The beauty of wedding anniversaries, birthdays, Father's Day, and Mother's Day, and all such special occasions, is that they furnish an excellent opportunity for expressing gratitude. We may grow a bit sentimental on special occasions without feeling foolish. The person who is self-conscious about expressing appreciation, even on special occasions, can find an appropriate card to carry his thought. Let us not be like the Scotchman who, when his friend voiced the goodness of the recently deceased wife, replied, "Aye, and once or twice I almost told her so!" A certain woman has had her widowhood sweetened by the remembrance of an expression her husband seldom failed to make at the close of each day, "God was good to give me you." It cannot be impressed on parents too strongly that children are natural imitators. ''Those who grow up in homes where gratitude is habitually expressed will unconsciously acquire grateful hearts. A certain mother, who had five children, lost her beautiful, nine-months-old daughter. Her heart hungered for another baby and, when one came, the mother found herself expressing over and over her love for the child. It was not until she heard the little girl say, "Oh, Mommie, what would I do without you," that she realized her own words were coming back to her. If the mother reminds the children of the thoughtfulness of their Daddy, she will hear them thanking their father after a pleasant outing, auto ride, trip to the movies, or some other joyful occasion. During, or after a childish illness, a father may recall to the child the tender care the mother has given him. The mother, in tum, may remind the 140 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�FEBRUARY 1947 LESSON DEPARTMENT child who it is that works early and late to earn the means that provide all of the necessary and pleasant things the family enjoys. One little fellow who had been unconsciously trained in these niceties, said to his mother, after his birthday party, "Oh, Mother, thank you for bringing me here." Children's birthdays furnish excellent opportunities for the parents to express gratitude for each particular child. Some families, on Thanksgiving Day, have formed the habit of going around the table before the festive meal starts and letting each family member mention at least one thing for which he or she is particularly thankful. Parents, who follow the counsel of our Church leaders to resume the practice of having home evenings with their families, will find these occasions ideal times at which to teach children to express gratitude. Tell them that they can thank their Father in heaven just as well as the grownups, and teach them to sing the well-known, little song by Mary Maple Dodge, which is to be found in the Primary Song Book: Can a little child like me, Thank the Father fittingly? Yes, oh yes, be good and true, Patient, kind in all you do, Love the Lord and do your part; Learn to say with all your heart... Father in heaven, we thank Thee. Children love to recite little poems, and the intimacy of the family circle furnishes an ideal opportunity. Familiar verses, such as the following, couched in such simple language that any child can understand them, teach a vital truth in what constitutes real gratitude. 141 WHICH LOVED BEST? "I love you, Mother," said little John; Then, forgetting his work, his cap went on, And he was off to the garden swing, And left her wood and water to bring. "T love you, Mother," said rosy Nell; "T love you better than tongue can tell." Then she teased and pouted full half the day, Till her mother rejoiced when she went to play. "I love you, Mother," said little Fan; "Today I'll help you all I can; How glad I am that school doesn't keep!" So she rocked the baby till it fell asleep. Then, stepping softly, she fetched the broom, And swept the floor and tidied the room; Busy and happy all day was she, Helpful and happy as child could be. "I love you, Mother," again they said� Three little children going to bed. How do you think that mother guessed Which of them really loved her best? Stories, too, without pointing too obvious a moral, can gain the attention of children and teach them to express their gratitude. It goes without saying that fathers and mothers desire their children to excel. Then parents should express their gratitude for the well-doing of children. This does not mean flattery, for flattery implies insincerity; but it does mean honest praise for worthy effort. Unconsciously, parents are prone to remark about children's mistakes rather than to note advancement. Sometimes good behavior patterns are taken too much for granted. No matter how small the accomplishment, a parent should remark pleasantly about it. In this connection, review Aesop's fable of "The Wind and the Sun," and take to heart the truth it emphasizes. THE WIND AND THE SUN The Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger.: Suddenly they saw a traveler coming down the road, and the Sun said, "I see a way to decide our dispute. Whichever of us can cause that traveler to take off his cloak shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin." So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind began to blow as hard as he could upon the traveler. But the harder he blew the more closely did the traveler wrap his cloak round him, till at last the Wind had to give up in despair. Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the traveler, who soon removed his cloak. Whether Aesop was a real or imaginary character is debatable, but the truth he exemplified in this short fable is very real and has been recognized by modern writers. One authority states, "With children, praise is much more effective as a motivating agent than reproof. In the absence of actual evidence to the contrary, there seems to be no good reason why this generalization should not be extended to include adults." President George Albert Smith once said: It does not pay to scold. I believe you can get people to do anything (if you can get them to do it at all) by loving them into doing it. Prayer as an Expression of Gratitude It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, And to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: To shew forth thy loving kindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night (Psalm 92:1-2) "Prayer is a form of thankfulness communicated from man to God." One of the best ways to teach gratitude to children is through family prayers. As they hear their parents thank God for the everyday blessings of life, for food and raiment, for health and strength, for their comfortable home, for each other and, above all, for the gospel, they cannot help but develop a greater sense of gratitude than if they did not pray together. One father always incorporated this sentence in his prayer: "We uphold before thee, thy constituted authority here on the earth." Any family group hearing and understanding such a statement would be less likely to criticize our Church authorities and would be more appreciative of their efforts. Teaching Children to Pray Teaching children to pray is a sacred and important duty of parents. Froebel said: A child's first idea of prayer comes to him when an infant, by his mother kneeling beside his crib in silent prayer. It is a recognized fact that before the child has any religious thought or religious expression, he is capable of religious feeling. Establishing the habit of prayer is not enough. Teach the child that: To say my prayer: s not to pray, Unless I mean the words I say. Children should be taught the sacredness of communion with God, and yet, should feel that he is a loving Father who is ever near, and who may be approached any hour of the day or night; one to whom we can speak with love and confidence as to our earthly father; one to whom we owe all the blessings we here possess�father, mother, _ sisters, brothers, home, friends, and _ all 142 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�FEBRUARY 1947 LESSON DEPARTMENT things which make life full and beautiful. Encourage a child to ex. Press his gratitude in his own words. Spontaneous Prayer is the most Significant in child life. Giving As a Means of Expressing Gratitude Our great Church Welfare Plan furnishes a wonderful Opportunity for expressing gratitude through giving,. And this is by no means the least worthwhile part of the whole Program. Such a program gives every man an intensified interest in his brother's welfare, Separate them threaten their religious solidarity, other way of expressing gratitude, and older people should expect deference from younger ones. A parent who allows a child to impose on him, is doing that child an injustice. We love those to whom we are kind and dislike those on whom we impose. Remember that it is more than likely that your children will treat you as they are accustomed to see you treat your own elderly parents, In this connection, an indelible impression was made upon the writer at a very tender age by the following incident: A father returning home at the end of his day's labors, found his little boy laboriously carving something out of wood. "What are you doing, little son?" the father asked, "T am making a wooden bowl," the boy replied. "When you are old and feeble like Grandfather and your hand shakes so that you cannot come to the table and eat with the 143 family, I shall give you this wooden bowl like the one which you have given Grandfather." wrong. In many cases, such an arrangement is made with the full consent, even at the Suggestion of the Parents; but let us repeat�parents who deny their children Opportunities to give grateful service to them are doing those same children an injustice, Speaking of the pioneers� not only the Mormon pioneers, but of all those who colonized Western America, President J. Reuben Clark said: None were subsidized, none either asked for or received governmental gratuities. Had they waited for these, indeed had they got them, America would never have been built. Some justify our present economic course by saying "times have changed." So they have, but character building has not. And, as character building has not changed, so fundamentals have not, nor ever will. In conclusion, let us return to some fundamentals mentioned by Drummond, remembering again that "gratitude is love expressed in action": If you love you will unconsciously fulfill the whole law. Take any of the ten commandments, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." If a man love God, you will not require to tell him that. 1 I | Would he ever dream of taking his name in vain if he loved him? "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." Would he not be glad to have one day in seven to dedicate more exclusively to the object of his affection? Love would fulfill all these laws regarding God. And so, if he loved man, you would never think of telling him to honor his father and mother. He could not do anything else. It would be preposterous to tell him not to kill. You could only insult him if you suggested that he should not steal�how could he steal from those he loved? It would be superfluous to beg him not to bear false witness against his neighbor. You would never dream of urging him not to covet what his neighbors had. He would rather they possessed it than himself.
