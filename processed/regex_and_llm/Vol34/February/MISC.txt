THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE THEY SAY OF YOU Berta H. Christensen They say, who see your picture on a wall, That you were kindly�lean, and tall Of stature; quite devoid of human greed, A man who met a crucial hour's need As few have done; who would not nourish hate, Who moved with humbleness among the great. They say you paced the corridor at night And prayed, in solitude, for wisdom's light, But held, though yearning for the guns to cease, A fettered soul too great a price for peace. You knew men's hearts, and I have heard it said, You understood, because your own had bled; Lincoln, in that dark night you glimpsed the dawn� Walk with us yet�the shadows have not gone. The Cover: "'Nature's Totem Pole," Monument Valley, Utah. �Photograph by Willard Luce
