Robinson, M. D. First Counselor, Yale Ward Bishopric, Salt Lake City, Utah THE THORPE B. ISAACSON FAMILY: Bishop Thorpe B. Isaacson, Lula Jones Isaacson; Joyce Isaacson Tribe; (Inset) BROTHER Thorpe B. Isaacson, who was appointed Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric, December 14, 1946, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Brother Marvin O. Ashton, was born September 6, 1898 in Ephraim, Utah, the son of Martin Isaacson and Mary Jemima Beal Isaacson. Bom of goodly parents, he also can be justly proud of others of his progenitors. His grandfather, Peter Isaacson, was the only member of Page 86 his family to join the Church in Denmark. He crossed the plains with the pioneers in 1855, and was soon sent by the Church authorities to help colonize Arizona. He later did much of the fine carpentry work on the Manti Temple, and lived in Ephraim for many years. He served the Church and the community faithfully until his death at the age of ninety-two. Henry Beal, grandfather on his mother's side, was president of BISHOP THORPE B. ISAACSON Sanpete Stake for many years. While serving in this capacity, he took a very active part in the founding of Snow College. Brother Isaacson is a graduate of Snow College. He attended the Brigham Young University, the Utah State Agricultural College, and the University of California. He has had seventeen years of teaching and coaching experience with the youth of Utah and Idaho. He is more than favorably known among these many thousands of young people. A great athlete himself, he has inspired many boys to self-improvement.. He has a very active and alert interest in all sports, and in the boys who play them. Brother Isaacson married Lula Maughan Jones of Wellsville on June 16, 1920, in the Salt Lake Temple. They had three children, two of whom are living at the present time: Joyce Isaacson 'Tribe, twenty-three, the wife of Royal L. Tribe; and Richard A.~ Isaacson, twenty, now laboring in the New England Mission. Finer children no parents could want. Brother Isaacson has been outstanding in his business achievements. At the time of his new appointment, he was general agent for Lincoln National Life Insurance Company in Utah, Idaho, and Nevada. He was named the most outstanding insurance man for that company in 1944. He has had a fine experience in the Church. He was president of the elders' quorum in the Yale Ward before being called into the bishopric. In September 1941, Brother Isaacson was chosen by Bishop A. G. Olafson of Yale Ward to be his 87 first counselor. While serving in this capacity, he had charge of the teachers' quorum, and for five years this quorum led the stake. He is a fine "'boys' man." He inspires boys because he knows their problems and can place himself easily and naturally on their level. Brother Isaacson is a natural leader of men; he places responsibility well; and he has the capacity to inspire men to discharge well their responsibilities. He has the ability to discern problems quickly and to make rapid disposition of them. These attributes will aid him, materially, in the discharge of his new responsibilities where great wisdom must be associated with great dispatch in handling so many of the temporal affairs of the Church. Brother and Sister Isaacson have also drunk deeply of one of the greatest of spiritual experiences. They lost their first child in infancy. Their only son was stricken with poliomyelitis and hovered close to death for several days. In this time of deep tribulation, came, perhaps, the deepest spiritual experience for Brother and Sister Isaacson. They came to know God, and God _ recognized their supplication in behalf of their son. Ever since, there has existed a closeness between this family and God that will only be further enriched by the experiences which will be forthcoming in Brother Isaacson's new calling. He will be respected for his ability, as well as for his deep concern for the welfare of his country and of his fellowmen, generally. That the Lord will magnify him further, that he may meet the responsibilities of his new calling, is the prayer all members of the Church have in their hearts for him. Second Prize Story Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest � "Cast Thy Burden" Rhea Reeder Smith HIS spring seemed different 'T to Ann. She often wondered why. Probably because owing to an adult brought responsibilities that, at times, she heartily disliked. Ann thought bitterly, I never thought life would be like this. I always thought that dreams came true. There's so much I expected and didn't get. It seems as if I never will. This particular thought sent a fresh wave of resentment through her, and she began the day very badly. The eternal struggle with bills wearied her. There were so many demands, and never enough money to provide for all the things they really needed, let alone a little to save, Or even enough, just once, to enjoy a foolish little luxury. It had been a long time since she and Doug had left the children to go out together. Ann prepared breakfast, noticing all over again the shabbiness of the little house. The neglected condition gnawed at her eternally and filled her with constant resolution to have a home of her own. The chipped sink, the scuffed woodwork that all her washing would not cover, but only accented, annoyed her more, daily. Yet the possibility of having their own place seemed farther away each day. Page 88 RHEA REEDER SMITH Ann brushed her hand across her forehead, as if to wipe away the tight feeling within her. It was a futile gesture. She sighed. Doug asked, "Don't you feel any better today?" Ann shook her head in a negative reply. She had really meant to start this day better. She had prayed that she would. Despondency had dwelt in her too long. Her attempts to conquer it were weak, and, instead, she had been conquered. She knew she had to fight this thing herself. No one could help her. Yet the "CAST THY BURDEN" bitterness came back too easily. She could not overcome it. Her state of mind was perilous, Doug suggested, "Come and eat. You'll feel better." She ignored him and did not join him at the table. He did not urge her. She was behaving like a small] child, when she enjoyed his concern and wanted him to coax her. She was ashamed and wretched that she fought her battle like a weakling. Yet, this was the way the poison ate at her spirit. Doug picked up his things to go to work. He drew a greenback out of his wallet and put it on the table. "Go buy yourself 4 new hat today. That's supposed to make a new money for the milkman, and the coal bill? "Ann, what you?" She was ashamed to confess to him the wretchedness within her, She needed his help, yet dared not ask for it. She couldn't let him know the terrible things in her mind. She mumbled, "If we could only Progress a little..." Doug said, "That's so like you lately, Ann, you refuse to see a bright side ahead. You fling back any attempt I make to try to help. Couldn't you possibly believe in me a little more, or find some shred of hope to cling' to? You did once. There are lots of things I want for my family, but being constantly upset about not having them won't help. The two of us can't succeed at anything with this wall between us!" He strode out of the house and down the street. Ann watched him. A voice within her said, "I send him off to his work each day feeling this way." Then the other Ann prompted, "A man can stand to go slowly. He sees enough progress at his employment to satisfy him. With a woman, there's and not enough change, that slowness becomes almost unbearable." Young Rick tiptoed into the room and came up behind her, saying, "Boo!" He grinned. Close behind him was Ca y. They had just got up. Ann patted them and offered them a strained smile. Cathy observed her mother close- ~ ly and pleaded, "Be nice, Mamma." Ann laughed and said, "T']] try, sweetheart." She helped them to their places at the table. She loved them, and they were lots of fun. She was ashamed that she complained so often about the food they spilled, their grimy hands, and their little squabbles. She hadn't wanted to hurt Doug by reminding him of his inability to please her, yet she did it all, over and over again. AXN cleared the table. She saw the money where Doug had thrown it. Board, but seeing the money brought back the confusion. She thought, I of mind? Today she had planned to wash the cupboards, Suddenly, she felt as if the house smothered her. She couldn't stay inside any longer. She went outdoors and began to rake the yard. She felt a little better in the fresh air. The mailman weaved his way down the street, with pleasant greetings for everyone he passed. He merely said, "Good morning," to Ann. She thought, he sees this mix-up in me. He's afraid I'll snap at him, too. The bands around her head grew tighter. She shook her head to seek relief. Doug had often told her, "You take everything too seriously, and imagine too much. You should forget yourself and the things you don't have." The urge to get her work done persuaded her back into the house. She made the beds and dusted. Yet she was miserable. She sat on the couch in the living room and leaned her head against the wall. There was soon a cramp in her neck. She pulled at the cover on the couch, wishing it were a comfortable divan. Cathy ran into the house. She seldom walked. "Can I have some bread and jelly?" Ann noticed the muddy tracks on the floor that followed the child in. She shook the child violently. "How many times have I told you not to track mud into the house?" Ann knew this was an ugly scene. She relaxed her hold. Cathy ran from the house, crying. The grime and clutter in a place like this only accented its shabbiness. Yet, it was unreasonable to expect small children not to make a muss ina home. Ann constantly nagged at the children about it. Then there was a rap on the door. It was Mrs. Bingham. She was old and lived in a nice, big house. She was lonely and visited around the neighborhood a lot. Ann let her in and sat on the couch. There was an awkward silence. "Don't you feel well, Ann?" Mrs. Bingham asked. "I'm just having one of my bad days." She bit her lip. A little moisture came into her eyes. Mrs. Bingham offered, "I know it's hard when your children are small, and your responsibilities seem almost more than you can bear..." She was a great-grandmother. "But the Lord provides ways to lighten the load. You and your husband are fine people and are making a desirable home for your children. It doesn't matter a lot if it's a rich home or a poor home, so long as you love one another, and there is a good spirit there. The things you want from life will all come in time, if you live right, and things are right inside you." It was almost as if she was inspired to say these things. Ann cried softly into her apron. Mrs. Bingham continued, "I know this is so. There were times when I felt I could never face the dawn of another day. I went gray overnight�"" Her voice trailed, and for a moment there was a troubled look in her eyes. Then she smiled. "I put up such pitiful little struggles, until at last I learned the right way to fight. 'Cast thy burden on the Lord, and he shall sustain thee.' It says that in the Psalms. You can read it there and see." Could this be? Mrs. Bingham so sweet and poised, and with all she had, could this confusion have come to her? "I came over to invite you to go  "CAST THY BURDEN" to Relief Society with me today. There's going to be a splendid lesson. You'd really enjoy it, Ann." "I'd like to, if I could get through my work in time." Mrs. Bingham advised, "Your work will wait. You really owe it to your family to get away a little. It's a soothing agent. Your children can play in the nursery. I know you'll find it worthwhile." "Maybe, I could come. I'll try," Ann promised. When Mrs. Bingham had gone, Ann flew about to get more work done. It really went faster when she knew there was some place to go. As she cleaned up the tracks on the living room floor, she thought of Cathy. She looked out of the door. Cathy was sitting quietly on the lawn. It was so unlike her. She was such an active child. Ann went to her. Cathy looked up suspiciously. 'There were traces of tears on her face. Ann took her in her arms and held her close. Cathy responded to the caress, and burrowed her face into her mother's neck. Ann's pleadings tumbled out. "I�m sorry I was cross. Mothers get tired and say things they don't mean. The mud doesn't matter. I'm glad you're my little girl, and I love you lots." Cathy smiled and said, "I's glad, too." "Would you like to go to a meeting with me?" "Is it Sunday School, Mamma?" "No, but get Rick, and we'll go." Cathy ran down the street calling lustily. Ann was feeling better already. She saw Mrs. Brown in her yard. Mrs. Brown was old and knew about everyone in town. Ann asked her, "Do you know much about Mrs. Bingham?" "Seems like I've always known her. Why?" "Just curiosity. She said she went gray overnight, and I wondered." "I believe I do remember some trouble they had over one of their boys," Mrs. Brown replied. "He got to going around in a bad crowd and worried them a Jot, and, finally, ran away from home. They didn't hear from him for months. It was a big blow to her, and she was ill for quite a While. But he turned out to be a pretty good fellow, anyway. I guess her bein' such a good woman had its effect." By one-thirty Ann's work was done, except the cupboards. The children were cleaned up. Ann was combing her hair and would be ready soon. "You're pretty, Ma," Rick said. "Oh, blarney," Ann returned. It was an old familiar phrase she had used when Doug complimented her. She had not said it for a long time. "And don't call me Ma!" "Okay, Ma," Rick teased, and ran from the house, challenging her to pursue him. I was a thrill to mingle at Relief Society meeting with busy mothers like herself, seeking companionship and enlightenment. The lesson was about a diary of a pioneer life. Long afterwards she would remember passages from it that were impressed on her mind: Yesterday I had to throw away my dowry. It was hard to do. With each piece, was a memory and a hope. But I saw that it must be. Our supply of food is more important, and the load was too heavy for the team to pull. I watched the chest grow smaller in the distance as we moved away; then John said, "Some day I'll get things like those for you, and things lots nicer, too."... It grows colder. Fall comes early this year. I pray that it will be good weather when my child is born, since it must be born in the wagon.... Our little daughter is beautiful. I wondered if the pains would ever end. It is only through God's mercy that I live. John and the elders administered to me several times and I was spared and have my lovely baby... There were no details of suffering, no hint of self-pity. How could women go through childbirth if a moving wagon and sing "All Is Well?" Ann pictured the hospital where Rick and Cathy had been born. There were doctors and nurses to attend you, comfortable beds, and women wore silk nighties. They gave you ether. The little pioneer band was marooned in the snow. 'There were many deaths. Mary wrote: Our little baby was taken from us in the cold. We had her for so short a time. We laid her away in a thin muslin gown, that another baby might use the clothes to keep warm and alive. I don't know how I will ever get over this. The hardships continued in Utah. They fought plague, crop failure, Indians, and colonized the new land for hundreds of miles. Some turned against the Church and became its bitterest enemies. Later in life, Mary wrote in her diary: I gave up my family and a lovely home to marry John, because he was a Mormon. I left my first-born back in the snow. I know what it is to go hungry. More than once our all was taken from us. I never did have as nice a home or as fine linens as the ones I gave up. It would have been easy many times to fall away. But we learned to trust in God and let him provide for us, when we needed help. That is the only way we could have endured. We saw that the things we pioneered for were the most glorious heritage we could pass on to our children. I never did give up as much as I gained. Ann returned home, knowing that all the things she was fighting for were normal desires, but far less important than she 'had seen them. She had not yet seen real trouble. Mostly, she had created her own. As Rick and Cathy played outside, she went into the house and knelt in prayer. "Dear God, I have wanted to find a way out of this confusion. Today I heard an answer from Mary, the little pioneer, and Mrs. Bingham. All that mix-up I was in, is evil. I can't work things out by myself, so please, God, you take care of us and thy will be done. Above all, give me peace of mind. Amen." She rose to her feet, laughing a little. She went to the kitchen and kindled the fire to prepare dinner. In the cupboard she saw the greenback Doug had given her. She took the money, thoughtfully, and put on her coat again. She would do things Doug's way, and buy a new hat. Purchasing a hat didn't take long. Ann already knew several she liked and that were becoming to her. She often tried on hats, while shopping around. There was some money left over. She would save that. She walked down the street towards home, with the twisted feeling gone. The pinched look about her eyes relaxed. She felt better inside, and looked better outside. The mood which had imprisoned her for so long slipped from her like a heavy  "CAST THY BURDEN" cloak. Now, she knew she could steel herself to accept the problems of bills, sickness, and disappointment, with no panic, for she knew the real way to face life. She wondered where along the way she had lost track of these values. Doug came home and entered the house cautiously, as if he had to judge his activity carefully. Ann realized he had been in the habit of doing that. She hummed as she set the dinner table. Doug and the children played in the living room. "How come Mamma doesn't tell us to be quiet, and she even sings?" she heard Doug ask loud enough for her to hear. 93 "She's got a new hat," Rick informed him. "So she loosened up and did something that wasn't sensible! I never did believe in the new hat theory, but maybe there's something to it." Ann was not stung by his sarcasm. She knew she deserved it. The barrier between them would be broken. It was the same shabby little house. Instead of noticing all its flaws, she saw it as a comfortable, cozy place to live. It was safe and warm, and had a brightness she had never seen before. It was the same spring day, but it was spring filled with promise, as she had loved it long ago.
