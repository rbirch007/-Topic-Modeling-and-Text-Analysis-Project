THE SKIER Margery S. Stewart He who is done with flying Knows a place Where he can touch the sky, So long a stranger; Where clouds will hold him In their light embrace, And mountains welcome him to Awe and danger. His poles, the stick, His slender skis, the rudder, He wheels into the heaven, Rides on wind. His heart soars, feeling the Familiar shudder Of cratered sky, hearing the thinned Singing of trees. He is content, Cleaving again the starry firmament. SiS Almighty God, we make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy holy protection; that Thou wilt incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government; to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another and for their fellow-citizens of the United States at large. �George Washington. (Prayer after Washington's Inauguration as President of the United States, from the copy in his pew, St. Paul's Chapel, New York City) Pioneer Stories and ON THE RIVER PLATTE�President Amy Brown Lyman in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by The Incidents (This is the six Society Magazine in honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration. Ed.)  THE following incident in the life of Alma Platte Spillsbury is related by his daughter, Ruby Spillsbury Brown of El Paso, Texas.
It was early in August of 1850. The weather was very hot and dry. The saints were traveling west from the Missouri River along the plains of Nebraska, and they had become short of water for both man and beast. They were being urged by the captain of the company to travel as fast as possible to get to the Platte River, and had stopped the caravan scarcely long enough for Fanny Smith Spillsbury to give birth to a child. A blanket stretched over the bows of the wagon shielded the mother and baby from the intense heat of the August sun, while the father walked along beside the wagon, prodding the lean, gaunt, thirsty oxen. Suddenly, the oxen raised their heads and began to sniff the air. They were nearing the Platte River and could smell the water. They quickened their steps. They needed no prodding now. Suddenly, they left the road and took a short cut to the river at quite a reckless speed. The young father tried desperately to get them back on the road, but did not succeed, and he was scarcely able to keep up with the wagon with its precious cargo. Other men in the caravan, seeing his predicament, rushed to help him,
but it was useless. The thirst-crazed animals smelled the water and sped on till they reached the river, then dashed over the bank, which was not very high nor very steep. The oxen went down sideways, and the wagon was overturned in the water. The running men soon reached the spot and fairly snatched the mother out of the muddy stream. "Oh, where is my baby?" she cried. "Right here," finally answered Bishop Edward Hunter, fishing the little bundle out of the water where it had been thrown when the wagon overturned. "But I am afraid there is not much life left in him," he added.
"We must bless and name him at once," said the father, and, calling the men around him, they took the child in their arms to give it a name before it breathed its last. "What shall we name him, Fanny?" tenderly asked the father. "Alma, for the Book of Mormon prophet, and Platte for this great river from which we have been rescued," she answered. By the time the prayer was finished, the baby was crying lustily, and they all knelt in prayer to thank their Heavenly Father that the life of this little child had been saved so miraculously.
MRS. Margaret Judd Clawson, wife of Bishop Hyrum S. Clawson and mother of the late President Rudger Clawson, used to entertain and amuse her friends by telling of her experiences on the plains. PIONEER STORIES AND INCIDENTS She was a character actress in the old Salt Lake Theater, and, therefore, her descriptions were graphic and her imitations dramatic. She was just eighteen when her family left Council Bluffs, in 1840, for the long trek. She was young, beautiful, and healthy, and was so optimistic that, although her company experienced encounters with the Indians, severe thunderstorms, and two stampedes, she always looked on the bright side, yes, the humorous side of life. The Judd outfit for the journey consisted of two oxen, six cows, and a wagon. The oxen were well broken in before they started, but the cows seemed to resent the idea of taking turns with the oxen in pulling the load and, in the beginning it took the whole family to put the yokes on the cows and get them started ahead. They seemed determined to go in the wrong direction. One of the cows, old Bossy, a favorite, was very intelligent and coy. She used to hide in the willows to keep from being yoked up. However, when once yoked, she was a good and faithful worker. She was also a good milker, contributing a generous amount daily for the family use. The days on the plains, according to Mrs. Clawson, were somewhat monotonous unless it happened that the scenery was unusual, or there were wild flowers and fruits to gather�fruits such as chokecherries, serviceberries, or wild strawberries. But the evenings were different and most interesting. At that time there was real activity�work and recreation�for everybody. 105 It was then that they bathed and washed their clothes in the river and scoured their buckets and tins and the utensils in which they cooked. And, while the women prepared the even. Ing meal, the men cared for the cattle. Mrs. Clawson had two youthful romances in connection with the journey. The night before she left Illinois, she parted with her girlhood sweetheart (whom she called at the time her "own true lover") with the understanding that the moment he was of age, he would follow her "even to the ends of the earth." She saw him next forty years later, when he had a wife and three children, and she a husband and thirteen children. There were several very nice young men in the company, which made it interesting for the girls. Among them was one who became infatuated with young Margaret, telling her she was the only woman he had ever loved, and that he was sure they were exactly suited to each other. So, after he had proposed marriage over and ever again, she finally consented to an engagement. The course of their love ran smoothly until they arrived in the Valley, where they had a_ lovers' quarrel with no making up. On the rebound, he rushed off and married another girl of the same company. "Such is the constancy of men" Mrs. Clawson would humorously exclaim. She later found that this was a blessing in disguise, for in time she married the late Bishop Hyrum B. Clawson, business associate of President Brigham Young, and for many years superintendent of Z.

"For THE RIGHTS OF THE Women OF Zion AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS DON'T WAIT Don't wait until I'm gone, dearest, Before you tribute pay, Till the spirit has departed, And left but lifeless clay; Do not wait till all is over, And then, with mournful lay, In a voice of trembling sorrow, Regret the long delay. � L. M. Hewlings HUMBLE TESTIMONY It seems that the time has fully come when the daughters of Zion are called upon to raise their voices and declare unto the nation and the world the testimonies which God has given them of His work in these last days .... Sisters, above all things, trust in God; have faith, and cultivate and exercise patience .... � Phena VARIOUS QUALIFICATIONS: My forte was needlework, to which I was fairly drilled, my first lesson beginning when I was so small (four years of age) that ma used to seat me on the table edge so that my work might be nearer her own eyes .... My very fond and indulgent father provided me with a gold thimble, made by a Spanish jeweler, from a nugget he himself had taken from the mines .... Afterward came long lessons from a lady teacher or governess .... I look around upon my almost idle young friends .... and think of their lack of knowledge in cutting out and making clothing and con-template how prominent a figure the hired seamstress will be in the future family circles of these dear girls .... � Augusta Joyce Crocheron FROM MANCOS, COLORADO: There are some few that are investigating our principles, and we hope they will see the truth .... The various organizations are in good working order. The Relief Society is doing well, considering its numbers .... The weather has been unusually fine this winter, scarcely enough snow to cover the ground. This is a remarkably healthful place .... We should ever be on our guard, prepared to defend our religion .... The young can no longer depend on their parents' testimony, but must obtain one for themselves. �Moselle Hall ZINA D. H. YOUNG: On Monday, January 31, a party of ladies assembled by invitation, at the residence of Mrs. Maria Y. Dougall, to celebrate the birthday anni-versary of M rs. Zina D. H. Young. There were present some of the veteran women of the Church, among the number, Sister Eliza R. Snow Smith, Catherine Horrocks, Sarah M. Kimball, M. Isabella Home, Susan S. Young, and others .... The party was a very pleasant one, and Sister Zina, whose name is a household word throughout Zion, must have realized that her friends were genuine in their appreciation. Page 106 Miss SALLY LUCAS JEAN, who has been a consultant on poliomyelitis in sixty countries, visited Salt Lake City in November, and, at a Soroptomists' dinner, publicly congratulated Mrs. Emily S. Stewart, daughter of President George Albert Smith, on her work as state director of women's activities for the National Foundation for Poliomyelitis. Utah, with a chairman in every county, stands at the top of the nation in organization, and in relief for sufferers, it was disclosed later, in a New York conference, attended by Mrs. Stewart, where the national president, Basil O'Connor, and Comelia Otis Skinner were speakers. Mrs. Stewart accompanied Miss Jean to a polio conference in Arizona, and on her way home, lovely Mary Pickford, a coworker in the fight against poliomyelitis, entertained for Mrs. Stewart at Pickfair, where, the hostess said, Mrs. Stewart won all hearts. OR the first time in history, a group to effect the advancement of women has met under the sponsorship of men and women, instead of women only. It is the Commission on the Status of Women, an outgrowth of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The goal of this organization is to provide for women a status equal to that of men in all fields of human enterprise�in political, social, and economic freedom; and in full personality development. Among others, women from China, Poland, India, South America, and Lebanon participated. MEETINGS of great import to women occurred in New York in late October, 1946. Mrs. Sterling Ercanbrack, Provo, President of the Utah Federation of Women's Clubs, and dean of all state presidents and a member of the executive committee in the general federation, was, on account of these positions, admitted into many exclusive sessions. She took part in a conference of the board of directors of the National Federation, whose watchword this year is "Conservation of Youth." She attended the brilliant International Assembly of Women, the delegates to which are chosen by their governments for outstanding ability and service to their countries. Fiftythree countries were represented by 137 delegates. The German and Japanese delegates addressed the group. All participants on the program spoke in English. The theme of the meetings was "The World We Live In and the World We Hope For." Mrs. Ercanbrack also attended sessions of the United Nations Conference and the challenging New York Herald-Tribune World Forum. Page 107 VOL. 34 C� EDITORIAL c~ FEBRUARY 1947 Si atthful to the Pioneer Heritage FTTIMES during the Centennial year of 1947, Latter-day Saints will recall the experiences of the pioneers, and wonder if they� descendants by lineage or tradition �are measuring up to the achievements and self-sacrifice of their pioneer ancestry. To the pioneers came the decision to forsake worldly possessions, acquired by arduous toil and struggle, at the behest of their Prophet. Treasures brought to Nauvoo from faraway homes were abandoned, along with the homes that held them. The saints were not permitted, as were the Children of Israel, to carry off jewels of silver and of gold and raiment from those from whom they fled. The Latter-day Saints carefully packed into their wagon boxes only the dire necessities�ireasures only in that they would be of most value in sustaining life on the hazardous journey across the frozen stretches of the Mississippi river, and on into an unknown land. Neither were the saints expecting to be fed by manna, nor to be led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. No visible signs encouraged them�none was needed. They relied, by faith, on the will of the Lord as spoken by his Prophet. In this day, Latter-day Saints live in neighborly accord with all men. Passed are the persecutions, and the Page 108 call to forsake worldly possessions wrested from the sagebrush wastes. Nevertheless, difficult trials, temptations, and testing experiences await each generation. The Lord has said that this life is a state of probation and that men are free to choose liberty and eternal life, or to choose captivity and death. So, today, also, he would have a tried people. To some women of the Church, it would seem that it would be easier for them to live the gospel by forsaking all worldly possessions and to set out in the company of others who likewise had no possessions, than it is for them to live modestly and prudently, sacrificing for the upbuilding of the Church, among neighbors in more affluent circumstances. The joy which would be experienced by a faithful and devoted saint, seems to fade away before the image of a beautiful car, costly apparel, jewels, or a luxurious home. However, from the records being written, it appears that tens of thousands of faithful Church women prize the gospel as their most priceless possession, and have joy in serving the Master and living his commandments. They choose liberty, not being enslaved by worldly desires. They sacrifice their personal wishes for the Church and kingdom of God, faithful to the heritage of their pioneer ancestors, and seeking earnestly to attain eternal life. M. C. S. NOTES TO THE FIELD Program for the Evening Service of Fast Sunday, March �, 1949 THE evening service of Fast Sunday, March 2, 1947, has been assigned to Relief Society. The General Board is scheduling a special Centennial program for presentation by all of the local Societies on that date. The program entitled "A Story in Granite and Bronze," by Sister Priscilla L. Evans of the Relief Society General Board, was inspired by the "This Is The Place" monument, to be dedicated July 24, 1947. The events symbolized by the groups of bronze figures on the monument will be presented by narrative and dramatic readers. Musical numbers by both the Singing Mothers and the congregation form an integral part of the program. In order that the message of the program may be more deeply appreciated, five large posters (size 22x34 inches) will accompany the printed narrative. The posters are of light-weight paper which will make it necessary to fasten them to a wall, mount them on cardboard, or otherwise arrange them so that the congregation may readily view them as the program proceeds. A nominal charge of $1.00 (postpaid) will be made for each set of five posters. Letters containing detailed information about the above program were mailed to Relief Society stake presidents November 27, 1946. Ward presidents are urged to give publicity to the program to ensure a large attendance. Congratulations to President Amy Brown Lyman on Her Birthday�February 7th RELIEF Society women everywhere are happy to remember at this time the birthday of Sister Amy Brown Lyman, who served for many years as a Board member, as an executive officer, and as president of the Society. Sister Lyman's work among women, particularly in the fields of social service and educational and cultural development, has been of great service to the Church. Her lessons on visiting teaching, and her interesting pioneer stories, currently featured in Theare sources of inspiration that help Latter-day Saint women to realize the vital strength of their heritage and the importance of their responsibilities. Happy birthday to you, Sister Lyman, and our gratitude for the example of effort and accomplishment that you have given us. May your continued service to women bring you much joy and satisfaction.
