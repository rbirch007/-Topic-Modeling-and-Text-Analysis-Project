European Relief Elder Marion G. Romney Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Report of food, clothing, and shoes sent by the Church in Zion, through its Welfare Program, to Church members (and others) in Europe, between October 29, 1945, and December 1946. For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat... Naked, and ye clothed me.,. Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me Matt. 25:35, 36, 4o), HEN the "cease fire" order W given in Europe on V-E day, May 8, 1945, there were approximately 30,000 Church members in the European missions. A complete and accurate record is being compiled, but it is not yet available. The best information at hand indicates that the membership in the respective Missions was as follows: Group I (Liberated Countries ) Swedish (Finland Only)... 5S Norwegian 1,500 Danish  Netherlands (Holland). 2,990 French (Including Belgium).... 700 Swiss-Austrian (France Only).. 300 Czechoslovakian 300 7245 Group IT (German Countries ) Swiss-Austrian (Austria Only).. 300 East and West German 1 14,100 14,400 Group III ee 5,000 (This figure is probably high ) Swedish ( Except Finland)..... 1,645 Swiss-Austrian (Switzerland a 1,500 8,145 The total of the three groups is 29,790. The saints living in the missions located in the liberated and Geran countries were in desperate need. In these countries, cities had been bombed, transportation Systems disrupted, industries demolished, farms and gardens trampled out and livestock driven off, and the substance of the People destroyed. For many months, the liberated countries had been occupied by a bitter and desperate invader. The people had been robbed and plundered of the Present necessities of life, and, in so far as possible, the means of Producing these necessities for the future had been destroyed or carted away. As the Peoples in Group I were being "liberated," 3 conquering enemy, in some instances equally bitter and desperate, moved in upon the German countries to reap revenge. The 21,646 saints in the liberated and German controlled countries needed bedding, clothing, and shoes immediately, and most of them were suffering for food. The saints listed in Group II] were in better circumstances. Switzerland and Sweden had not been at war and were largely self-sustaining. The people in the British Isles had suffered much in the war, but were in large measure able to secure for Page 75 themselves life's necessities with money received, in the main, from the United States, through lend lease funds and otherwise. Some bedding, clothing, shoes, and food, however, have been sent to the saints in the British Isles from the stakes and missions in Canada. The Relief Society sisters in the Canadian Mission have rendered a most noteworthy service in this program. In this connection, the European Mission headquarters reported in February of last year that: The many packages received by the saints (in the British Isles) through the Church Welfare Program have filled a very great need and have given the saints new hope and courage.... Much distress has been alleviated through the Church Welfare Program, and the packages which the saints have received, and are daily receiving, have manifested in very deed the brotherly love and affection that binds the Church together. Grateful appreciation from saints in all parts of the mission is being expressed daily. The hearts and hands of all welfare-minded saints in the stakes and missions of the Church responded in unison to alleviate the suffering across the sea. Many sent unsolicited cash contributions to be used in defraying transportation and other costs. Transportation and distribution was a major problem. 'Transportation systems were high on the priority list of the enemy war potential, and, in all countries, had been systematically bombed and_ otherwise destroyed. Shipping was overburdened, carrying men and war material. Restrictions and regulations incident to military government were cumbersome and delaying. In November 1945, President George Albert Smith headed a delegation to Washington, and contacted heads of United States government departments, from the President down, building good will and clearing away transportation obstacles. The sending of relief supplies into the German countries was absolutely prohibited through 1945 and the early months of 1946. Shipments in bulk by boat to the liberated countries were slow and extremely difficult during 1945. Under these conditions, and in view of the fact that the most urgent need of the saints in the liberated countries was for bedding, clothing, and shoes, it was determined to send these items to them by parcel post, which was by far the fastest transportation. Post-office regulations permitted the sending of packages not heavier than eleven pounds each. Arrangements were made with most of the governments in the liberated countries to admit the packages duty free. T was determined to send an eleven-pound package of bedding and an eleven-pound package of clothing for each of the 7,245 Church members in the liberated countries. There were available in bishops' storehouses throughout the Church, 3,326 quilts, 175 blankets, and 1,655 pairs of shoes. These quilts had been made during the war years by the Relief Societies as part of the annual Church Welfare budget. In most cases, the material had been donated by the sisters of the Relief Society or purchased with money from the Relief Society charity funds. In addition to the quilts and  EUROPEAN RELIEF blankets in the bishops' storehouses, the Relief Societies in "war risk" areas had on hand 6,636 quilts and 1,941 blankets in their war emergency kits, which they made available to the Church Welfare Program to meet this exigency in Europe. These kits had been accumulated against an emergency under the supervision of the General Relief Society Presidency at the instance of the First Presidency of the Church. The bedding in the bishops' storehouses and in the ward Relief Society war-emergency kits was moved into stake and regional bishops' storehouses, where it was packed into eleven-pound packages (in most part by Relief Society sisters) and 7 Prepared for shipment by parcel post. During the latter part of Novem. Ber and the first part of December 1945, the Relief Society teachers left with every family in the stakes of Zion located in the United States, a smitten invitation to take to their ward meeting houses on December loth and 11th, "for the suffering European saints, the good, clean clothing which has been accumulated in Latter-day Saint homes, available for this purpose." Later, a similar program was adopted and carried through in the missions of the United States and Canada. In response to these calls, approximately 596,848 good, wearable ar.

This clothing was sorted, mended, and classified, largely by the Relief Society sisters, and moved into stake and regional storehouses, where it was packed and prepared for shipment. Frequently, a few items, such as a bar of soap, a can of concentrated food, a package of needles, or some other needed item was placed in the packages to bring them to the proper weight. Between October 29, 1945, and March 31, 1946, 14,679 eleven-pound packages of bedding, clothing, and shoes were mailed by the Church in Zion to the saints in the missions in the liberated countries. These packages were mailed from the following welfare regions: Bannock Boise Cache Central Utah Eastern Idaho Jordan Valley Northern Utah Salt Lake Southern California Virgin River Packages were also sent from the Washington, Chicago, and New York Stakes, which are not in regions, and from the New England Mission. "Where names and addresses of saints were known, packages were addressed directly to them. Most of the packages, however, were sent to the European mission and district presidents to be distributed by them, with the help of the Relief Society presidents, among the saints according to need. There were also sent to these same countries, apportioned according to population, 4,532 packages, each containing 100 capsules of vitamins. We do not, as yet, have a complete record from all the missions as to how many of the parcels sent have reached their destination, but we do have a report that, as of the 12th day of April, 1946, 3,384 of the 3,608 parcels sent to Norway. Had been received in good condition and that "fifteen of the eleven-pound packages containing a total of 641 boxes of vitamins have arrived." Soon letters of appreciation from the European saints began to arrive. From them the following typical excerpts are quoted: From the French Mission: My mother, who doesn't speak English, asked me to thank you for your parcels. It was a very good surprise for us�I say for us because I benefited by them, too. My mother gave me the dress, which fits me very well, the baby clothes, and a blanket. I recently married, and it's very difficult in France to find any bedding. Before that we covered ourselves with our coats. From the Danish Mission: We thank you very much for the packages which we received from America. My wife was so happy that she cried for joy, and jointly we send our heartiest thanks which we ask you to forward to the Church in America. My wife says it was the greatest joy she had since May 5th (the day of our liberation). We are happy and grateful to the Church. From the Norwegian Mission: To those who sent those wonderful packages with clothing, I am sending grateful thanks. A thousand times thanks. It was a wonderful Christmas present to me and my two sisters. We praise those who are doing it in their life and in action. In all God's creation we see all these wonderful things.  EUROPEAN RELIEF Photograph Courtesy of the Deseret News PACKING CLOTHING FOR THE EUROPEAN SAINTS ON WELFARE SQUARE, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH From the Netherlands Mission (Holland): - Herewith take I the liberty to send you this letter in reply of your parcel that you have sent us last month from your country. We will tell you, dear brothers, we are very happy with these packets that you have sent to us. All the same, we are happy with these things that we receive from the members, brothers and sisters and more from the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Never we forget these things, they are the best our life, because we found here the original faith in our Father in Heaven. As we have any food for one week much little (1 roll of 400 gram), we sing our songs by organ in the living room and no electric light, all darkness. The parcel sent by you October 29th has been received. Accept all of you who have contributed our sincere thanks. It was a very fine variety of goods, which enabled us to again really wash, and to sew with real thread, for we were not used to that in a great while. There has been a lot of good things gathered together by the saints in Zion and made us conscious of the unity in spirit and cause, which means to help those who belong to that same kingdom. We hope God will bless you all for what you have done for your fellow brethren and sisters. Sometime ago it came to my mind to write a letter to thank you for the box of clothes I received from the Church Welfare. I don't know if this letter will come to the place where it belongs because | don't know to whom to write, so I am addressing it to the address that was on the box. In the box sent to me was a lady's coat, a dress, two suits underwear, a shirt, sweater, two pair stockings, and five bars of soap. We went on our knees with thankful hearts to our Heavenly Father for the things we needed so much. We thank the members of the Church that have done this for us. We thank the Church for this nice and wise plan and that you are mindful of us here in our so poor Netherland. Oh, how much happiness it will bring among God's children, and what happiness to receive these things at this time. We can't buy much over here and everything is so high in price and not much good, what we can get. But God is good. He knows just what his children are in need of and he takes care of us. What a pleasure it is to get things from America. ELDER EZRA TAFT BENSON, former president of the European Mission, and his office have reported as follows as to the effect the receipt of these packages has had in the respective European missions: French Mission (including Belgium): February 24, 1946: The Welfare boxes have arrived in good condition. April 12, 1946: In a special meeting in Liege with Elder Paul Devignez, acting mission president, and with his counselors, it was learned that over 600 Welfare packages have been received by the saints. All packages have been opened upon entering the country and some items have been removed by marauders, but the items received have in large measure taken care of their present clothing needs, and over 100 packages have been set aside by the saints for shipment to the members in Germany as soon as permission to do so is obtained. Danish Mission: February 23, 1946: A considerable number of Church Welfare packages have been received by the saints. Food in Denmark is more plentiful now than probably any other country in Europe and even during the war the saints were well fed. Clothing is still quite difficult to secure, but the welfare packages have alleviated this need and the saints are in excellent physical and spiritual health. February 24, 1946: The Welfare packages have been received and deeply appreciated.... None of the products received have entered the "Black Market." Swedish Mission (Finland Only): February 23, 1946: The Church has one small branch in Finland. These saints have been grievously impoverished by the war and are finding the Welfare packages most helpful. February 24, 1946: Shipments to Finland should be continued and increased, with emphasis on food, shoes, and children's and infants' clothing. Norwegian Mission: February 23, 1946: The people of Norway are quite run down physically because of the rigors of long enemy occupation of their land. Much of the need has been relieved through the assistance received from the saints in the Danish and Swedish missions and the present Welfare shipments are continuing to give them the more necessary items of food, clothing, and bedding. Netherlands Mission (Holland): February 23, 1946: Much of the critical need for food, clothing, and bedding has been filled through the generous number of relief packages received by the saints from the Church Welfare project. February 24, 1946: Welfare packages have been arriving in good condition and are being distributed through branch presidents.... In this, and in all other missions, there is in evidence a feeling of deep gratitude for the material assistance rendered. In no case have we found that any of the Welfare commodities have found their way into the "Black Market." April 12, 1946: Thousands of packages have been received from the Church Welfare committee. With the exception of the occupied areas, the need for continued assistance is probably most critical and urgent in Holland and Norway.  EUROPEAN RELIEF Czechoslovakian Mission: April 1, 1946: In Czechoslovakia they had received only 30 packages, practically all of which had been opened and most of the readily edible food products removed. Of interest in connection with the shipment of these parcels was a letter from a postal employee in the Amsterdam, West Holland, post office, which read in part: Being a postal official at the Central Station Post Office at Amsterdam, charged with the distribution and forwarding of postal parcels, I picked up your address among the senders. As many articles are very scant here in Holland or even not to be had at all, I kindly beg to request you to send me a postal parcel, if possible, containing some men's and women's underwear and textile goods. I should not have had the courage to ask you this favour, but as I told you already, I need it badly. I know that the remittance of money to your country is not yet allowed, but I assure you that I shall send you the amount due as soon as it will be per-mitted to remit money again, and I am gladly willing to do you a service in re-turn. His request was, of course, grant-ed. A parcel was sent to him and a parcel was sent for his wife, which they received and gratefully acknowledged. WHILE the parcel post packages were being dispatched, every ef-fort was being made to arrange shipment of relief supplies to Europe, in bulk, by rail and boat. Under the direction of the First Presidency of the Church, members of the General Authorities, the General Church Welfare Committee, and others contacted government departments and agencies in Washington, ship-ping companies and relief agencies in New York, and other water-front cities, and railroad officers and offices in all parts of the United States to arrange for bulk shipments. The oft-repeated counsel of President Smith was, ''Give the Lord a chance," and it truly seemed that the Lord paved the way for successful negotiations, for everywhere the finest spirit of understanding and co-operation was encountered. Particularly helpful and co-operative have been the American Relief for Holland, and Mr. Victor H. Scales of that organization. Ways were opened up early in 1946 for shipment by r ail and boat into all the missions in the liberated countries. It was determined to supplement the parcel post shipments with bed-ding, clothing, and shoes enough to provide for the needs of the saints through the winter of 1946-1947, and to send them enough soap and such foods as dried beans, cracked wheat, canned vegetables, canned fruits, canned meats, pork and beans, evaporated milk, and jams to last them through September 1946, the end of the harvest season. The clothing was available from the collection above described, and the foodstuffs were, in the main, in the bishops' storehouses throughout the Church, an eloquent testimony to the inspiration of the First Presidency in urging the continued pro-duction of t he annual Church Wel-fare budget during the weary war years when, to many, such production seemed an unnecessary burden. To the Relief Society is due credit for helping to carry on with the burden during that critical time, particularly in the canning of fruits and vegetables.  The first two carload shipments left Salt Lake City on February 15, 1946. They reached Norway on the 5th of April, 1946 Of them, President A. Richard Peterson of the Norwegian Mission wrote: On the 5th of April the two carloads of food and clothing arrived aboard the SS Idefjord. The first part of the shipment to be unloaded was the "Treet." Of the 300 cases reportedly shipped, two were lost in shipment and we received 298 cases. On the 10th we hauled this meat to mission headquarters for storage. The rest of the shipment was not completely unloaded from the ship until after the Easter holiday, and it was not possible to have all this shipment stored until the 25th of April. We received excellent cooperation from the Priesthood. Two brethren with trucks were engaged in hauling and twenty-five others assisted in loading at the docks and unloading in the - storeroom in the basement of the mission headquarters. The work progressed rapidly and the brethren enjoyed working one with another on the project. The sisters of the Relief Society arranged and prepared wonderful luncheon meals on the days we were engaged in the work. It was pleasing to note that loss and damage were kept at a minimum. There seems to have been two cases of meat and one case of milk which were missing upon arrival. However, the cases were, on the whole, in very good shape and, of course, the contents fully protected. The ammunition boxes used were very fine, and it was found that the wire bindings used were of great value. The milk and cracked wheat, which came in cardboard boxes, arrived in good shape. However, there were a few bags of wheat which were broken and about four dozen cans of milk punctured and dented, evidently due to rough handling during transit. Four men's suits were missing from one box, and a dozen men's shirts in another. Otherwise, the clothing was in excellent condition. There had previously been assembled the number of saints in each branch so the food could be equally distributed, and the needs and sizes of clothing compiled, in order to be able to distribute the clothing where it would do the most good and be used to the best advantage. The saints were pleasantly surprised at the amount of food and clothing they received, and in the way it had been prepared. The saints are especially anxious for the saints in Zion to know how much they appreciate their efforts in making this Welfare contribution, and their sincere thanks is expressed to all. With further reference to this shipment, President Ezra Taft Ben-� son, lately of the European Mission, and his office, sent the following report from Stavanger, Norway, under date of May 2, 1946: The carload of clothing and food already received, and on which President Peterson wrote you April 12th, has proven a great blessing to the people of this mission. We found, on our arrival, that President Peterson has made distribution of most of these two carloads. It is almost impossible to overestimate the value of these Welfare shipments to the Norwegian saints, including the mission president and his staff, who have also been short of food. With the arrival of the carload of clothing, the carload of food, and 300 cases of meat from Zion, the saints in this mission have been adequately supplied with necessary wearing apparel and many items of food which were critically short. To see the large number of members almost completely outfitted in American clothing makes one feel as though he were speaking to an American audience. The gratitude of the saints is reflected in their increased activity and devotion to the Church. Too much cannot be said for the feeling of brotherhood this has engendered among our people. And from Bergen: Here the saints tendered us a hearty reception and evidence of the invaluable assistance which has come through the Welfare Program to these good people could be noted on every hand. They look well and strong and are better clothed and fed now than the average. The rest of the shipments have gone forward to the saints in the liberated countries with regularity and all possible dispatch. While we do not have complete reports as to their arrival at their destination, we do have a report made by President Benson to the First Presidency, dated May 21, 1946, as to the Nether-lands, as follows: The first carloads of Welfare supplies have arrived, but most of them have not yet been unloaded due to strikes at the water front. Those unloaded thus far ap-pear to b e in good condition. A survey of the needs of all members in the mission has been conducted, and arrangements to quickly distribute the needed articles in so far as they are available have been made. Shipping to foreign countries has been a new procedure in Church Welfare, and it has been heartening to see how quickly and how well it has been mastered. The untiring work of men and women in the wards, stakes, regions, and missions is gratefully acknowledged. Special mention is due Brother Roscoe W. Eardley of the General Church Wel-fare Committee and his staff, who have directed the actual shipments. WITH the able help of President Ezra Taft Benson, lately of the European Mission, arrangements were made for sending supplies to the saints in the missions in the German countries. LOADING BOXES OF WOMEN'S COATS ON A FREIGHT CAR FOR SHIPMENT TO THE SAINTS OVERSEAS On the 8th day of May, 1946, the first carload lots left Salt Lake City, destined for Munich and the Haag, Austria. On June 15, 1946, they had arrived in Geneva, Switzerland, and were being checked and divided for destination. Since then, shipments have been made to sixteen different points within the German countries designated by Brother Benson. They have included bedding, clothing, shoes, and food. The quality and the quantity in proportion to Church membership have been comparable to that sent to the liberated countries. Of the arrival at their destination of these supplies sent to Germany we have had no further word. Knowing the hazards of transporting foodstuffs and clothing, for which people are in such desperate need in that unfortunate country, we are anxiously awaiting a reassuring report. A call recently reached us from the saints in Syria, where we have about 100 members. On June 14, 1946, we sent to them: 161 cases canned fruits 268 cases canned vegetables 25 cases canned meat 25 cases canned milk 10 cases grain drinks 7 cases soap 1,082 pieces men's clothing 1,153 pieces women's clothing 2,258 pieces children's clothing 606 pieces babies' clothing The Church, through the Welfare Program, has also contributed liberal quantities of clothing and shoes for general distribution among non-Church members in some of the European countries where the need has been greatest, notably in the Netherlands. On the 27th day of June, 1946, another carload of relief supplies was dispatched for Europe. These bulk shipments, exclusive of those sent by parcel post, included: 525,300 cans vegetables 196,989 cans fruits 29,919 cans meat 94,272 cams evaporated milk 11,760 cans pork and beans 4,248 cans jam 74,526 lbs. Dried beans 87,045 lbs. Cracked wheat 112 cases grain drinks' 16,600 bars soap 3,888 cans sorghum 512,848 pieces clothing 31,341 pairs shoes se� � December 31, 1946: Since the foregoing report was prepared, there have been sent by parcel post to the saints in the European Mission, from the stake Welfare regions, and missions in the United States, seventy-nine eleven-pound packages of food, clothing, and shoes. In addition to these parcel post packages, there have been sent, by rail and boat, three and one-fourth cars of clothing and shoes, and five cars of food, containing: 21,048 cans vegetables 9,600 cans fruits 21,728 cans meat 34,416 cans evaporated milk 13,920 cans dried whole milk 11,520 cans pork and beans 600 cans jam 4,128 pounds dried beans 168 cans honey 220,500 pounds cracked wheat 50 cases grain drink 300 bars soap 168 packages soap powder 1,200 cans sorghum 166,556 pieces clothing 11,921 pairs shoes We have the purported names and addresses of 109 Church-member families living in Japan. For  EUROPEAN RELIEF the last few weeks, United States post-office regulations have permitted the sending of eleven-pound parcel post packages to Japan. The Central Pacific Mission has sent, 200 such packages, containing clothing, medicine, and food, to these Japanese saints. From the Central Bishops' Storehouse on Welfare Square in Salt Lake City, 154 packages of food, clothing, and first-aid supplies have been mailed to them. These packages have been prepared by the Japanese saints in the Salt Lake area under the supervision of the General Church Welfare Committee. The whole program has been directed by the First Presidency of the Church, who have given it close personal attention. It has been supervised by the General Church Welfare Committee, with whom the General Relief Society Presidency has worked in the closest harmony. And now, what lies ahead we do not specifically know. We do know, however, that in the stakes of Zion the Welfare production of commodities was approximately three and one fourth times greater, in 1943, than was the distribution of commodities in that year through bishops� storehouses; and that, in 1945, the distribution through bishops' storehouses (not counting any relief for Europe) was greater than the production of Welfare commodities in 1945 (distribution was, 107 per cent of production). 85 We know, further, that the aid extended to our saints in Europe has taken approximately two thirds of our bishops' storehouse stocks. It is no secret that a food crisis exists throughout the world. We are feeling the pinch of it in our own beloved United States. The First Presidency of the Church has sounded the call for the expansion and further development of the Church Welfare Plan, with ever-increasing production of the necessities of life. They have said that, "If the Welfare Plan is fully operative, we shall be able to care for every destitute Latter-day Saint wherever he may be." From the past record of the Relief Society, we know that its members can, with confidence, be relied upon to increase their efforts on Welfare production projects so that in this, the day of demonstration for the Church, it shall "arise and shine forth, that" its "light may be a standard for the nations" (Doc. And Cov. 115:5).
