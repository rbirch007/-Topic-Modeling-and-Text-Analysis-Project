TWO FIGURES
Eva Matson Perry
In a beautiful home of fashion and pride, Two figures are standing, side by side. One is of marble, pure and white, The other a child to be guided aright. One was paid for in yellow gold, The other the price can never be told. It was sent by God from heaven above And paid for by parents' holy love. So handle them both with tender care, The marble so white, and the child so fair.
