A MOTHER'S POEM
Ella J. Coulam
She yearned to write a poem To the rhythm in her heart, But household cares were many; No rhymed lines would start.
She washed a dusty window And ironed dampened clothes, Her work was done in rhythmic beat Which every mother knows.
Her poem was a masterpiece, A home for all to share, Each thought was filled with mother love Which God had planted there. THE HENRY D. MOYLE FAMILY Seated, left to right: Kenneth W.

Moyle, Jr.; Janet Moyle; and Richard Wright Elder Henry D. Moyle�The New Apostle Elder Harold B. Lee Member of the Quorum of the Twelve of the Prophet Moses, characterized an able man as one who feared God, loved the truth, and hated covetousness. As measured by that characterization, Henry D. Moyle, newly sustained member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is an able man�he fears God, loves the truth, and hates covetousness. Again paraphrasing another statement from the scriptures recording the Apostle Paul's Page 302 Jiri! The wise father-in-law appraisal of his beloved Timothy's ancestry�"the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice... And in thee also"�it can also be said that not alone are these qualities to be found in this man whom the Church has honored with the highest position it can bestow, but like qualities were also in his father James H. Moyle and his mother Alice E, Dinwoodey, who are true representatives of the finest pioneer blood of this generation. ELDER HENRY D. MOYLE 
Here is the exact OCR transcription of the text:
Now, to briefly chronicle the history of his life to the present time: He was born in Salt Lake City, April 22, 1889. He received his early education in the schools of Utah and received his bachelor of science degree from the University of Utah, and a law degree from the University of Chicago, and did graduate work at the University of Freiberg in Germany and at Harvard University. His scholastic education was interrupted for three years while he served as a missionary for the Church in Germany. During the first World War he served with distinction as a captain in an infantry division. As an attorney he achieved the high place of United States District Attorney for Utah. His principal business interests have been with the Desert Livestock Company, and with three oil companies, the Inland Empire Oil Refinery at Spokane, Washington, the Wasatch Oil Refining Company, and the Idaho Oil Refining Company, all of which he was largely instrumental in organizing.
In his growing-up years he was always active in the Church, and for ten years presided as the president of the Cottonwood Stake in Salt Lake County. Because of his vigorous leadership as a stake president in getting the Welfare Program of the Church under way in his stake, he was appointed in July 1936 by the First Presidency a member of the General Church Welfare Committee where he has since served as chairman, which position he holds at the present time.
So, at fifty-eight years of age, Henry D. Moyle brings into the councils of the General Authorities of the Church a strength of character, a vig-
experience and accomplishment that will be of inestimable worth to these councils. He is not unknown to the body of the Church, for during the past ten years he has visited many of the stakes of Zion as an able teacher and a fearless exponent of the principles of the Welfare Program.
But, as always with a man of such qualities and high attainments, there is another side less heralded or publicized. In the quiet of his beautiful home in Holladay, there are his most treasured possessions and accomplishments, his lovely wife and companions, Alberta Wright, whom he married in 1913, and his four daughters, Alice, Marie, Virgina, and Janet and his two sons Henry and Richard. You haven't seen the full beauty in this man's soul until you have seen him as I have, waking his baby Richard at midnight to fondle him or to tiptoe into the bedroom as we did the other night, together, to see his latest grandson whom he calls his little "Patootie." Father love was never more in evidence than when you see this man, with pardonable pride, listening to music played by one of his accomplished daughters, or counseling with his son "Hank" about his cow or chicken projects. With the love and inspiration of such a wife, and the loyalty and support of such a family, this father has had, in them, some of the essentials to high and worthwhile achievement.
After I was asked to prepare this article I searched some of his writings and written addresses to find a statement that would reveal the source of the characteristic driving qualities of his life. I think I found it in this quotation: "With faith in God, with faith in our own destiny, and with in-

Elder Eldred G. Smith Named Patriarch to the Church Elder Edwin Q. Cannon President, Ensign Stake BECAUSE of my privilege of close association with Eldred G. Smith, I take pleasure in setting forth the knowledge and im-pressions I have concerning him. My first observance of him was when he took up his residence in the Twentieth Ward in which I resided, in November 1936. I was especially attracted to him because of the great faith I had in his father, Hyrum G. Smith, as the Church Patriarch. I had received from him a patriarchal blessing from which I had derived much comfort, Page 304 guidance, and assurance. When, later, I became bishop, I chose him as one of my counselors. This place he occupied from May 1938 until March 1940, when he was taken into the Ensign Stake High Council. When the ward was divided in March 1941, he was chosen bishop of the North Twentieth Ward. ELDER ELDRED G. SMITH While occupying these positions he was faithful, unassuming, humble, and an indefatigable worker. In addition to his heavy Church obligations, he and Sister Smith had real responsibilities at home, as twins were born during that time and, with a family of very young children, there was much to think about and things were not easy. He remodeled his home, including papering and painting, doing most of the work himself. The only time he had for this was during the night hours. I realized he had really too much to do and at times I felt concerned over his ability to keep up the strenuous life, even though he met it cheerfully and gratefully. Never did he utter a word of complaint. In January 1944 he took a defense position at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, necessitating his resigning as bishop. He was reluctant to do this, but it was wartime. On his way to his destination he stopped at Louisville, Kentucky, to see Brother Graham Doxey, President of the East Central States Mission, with the idea in mind of offering his service, in any way possible in that mission. Because of the secret nature of the work being done at Oak Ridge, he was unable to get permission to hold gatherings in halls provided for such 305 purposes, so he invited the members of the Church to his home, where they held services, using boxes as chairs and table. These gatherings continued until thirty-five children and sixty-five adults were in attendance. Then President Doxey visited Oak Ridge and formed a branch, making Elder Smith branch president. Later, permission was obtained to use the project school building. Many activities were engaged in, such as excursions to other branches in the vicinity, and an outstanding work was accomplished in behalf of the Church. Brother Smith took great pleasure in all of this. Between 1926 and 1929 he fulfilled a mission in Germany for the Church. In August 1932 he married Jeanne Ness who has stood faithfully by him and their lovely family. They have four children, Miriam, twins� Gary and Gay, and Gordon. Besides his devotion to his own family, he has always been affectionately devoted to his widowed mother, Martha G. Smith. THESE THINGS | KNOW Mabel Jones Gabbott These things I know: That night will follow day, And bitter winter means a brighter May; That rain and sunshine lend a bud new life, And peace is sweeter after days of strife. This, too, I know: Love never really dies; Its memories are mirrored in the skies; And pain can cease its pulsing unawares. Above all this: God hears and answers prayers. Relief Society an Aid to Bishops President Belle S. Spafford [This talk was delivered at the request of meeting in the Tabernacle, Friday evening, E sincerely appreciate the opportunity afforded Relief Society of presenting to this great gathering of bishops, upon whom the Lord has placed the responsibility of caring for those in need, a few thoughts as to how Relief Society presidents may be. Of greater assistance to you in this important and sacred work. "The relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow, and the orphan, and the exercise of all benevolent purposes" was one of the primary objects of our Society as set forth by the Prophet Joseph Smith. In this, as in all phases of our program, we work under the direction and guidance of the Priesthood. Relief Society is vitally interested in the Church Welfare Program as it is being carried forward today, and it is anxious to do its part according to the desires and recommendations of the Priesthood authorities who preside over us. In fact, our success as an organization must, in large measure, be gauged by the quality of our contribution to the Welfare Program of the Church. Every member of our Society is afforded opportunity to contribute to the Program by giving sewing service or service on canning or food processing, harvesting, or other Welfare projects. Our Relief Society presidents hold a unique position. They have been termed by Elder Harold B. Lee "the bishop's right-hand Page 306 Bishop LeGrand Richards at the Bishops' April 4, 1947�Ed.] assistants" in his responsible calling of caring for those in need. As an aid to the bishop, it is our opinion that the most valuable contribution a Relief Society president can make is to visit, at his request, the home of each family %r ward member in distress, study its circumstances and needs and then make recommendations to the bishop, in private, as to the care of the family. This service is in harmony with recommendations to bishops in the Church Welfare Handbook of Instructions, which states: Any family reported to be in need should be visited immediately in order that an intelligent analysis may be made. Subsequent assistance should be based on this analysis. Responsibility for this visit and analysis rests with the bishop, but it is recommended that he call upon the ward Relief Society president to make this investigation. In making this analysis careful consideration should be given to all known factors, and recommendations should be made to the bishop for the care of the family, both as to meeting any immediate, urgent needs, and with respect to assisting the family in solving other problems with which it may be confronted. This is a logical assignment for Relief Society presidents since they are qualified by nature and experience for this type of work. Relief Society presidents are women of judgment and spiritual strength, otherwise as bishops you would not have called them to so responsible a position as that of a Relief Society president. They have sisterly, sympathetic insight into family problems. They are mothers and home-makers themselves. They under-stand the problems of homemaking and home management. They know what to look for in judging a family's situation. They are adroit in showing mothers how to get the most out of the means at their disposal. And this type of service is often much needed. In many homes where there is need, mothers do not know how to bake their own bread, remodel or make clothing; they do not know how to preserve fruits or can vegetables; neither do they know how to do their part in wisely managing any income the family may have. It is poor care of a family which fills its request for help without carefully studying its deep-seated needs and skillfully guiding and training it to-ward independence. TO thoroughly understand a family's situation, and to adequately plan for its present and future welfare requires time. Often many visits to a home are necessary to understand its situation and needs. Our interest in families should be a sustained interest. Relief Society presidents are, as a rule, freer to make these time-consuming visits than are bishops. So we feel ward Relief Society presidents are eminently qualified for this work. However, according to the 1946 Relief Society annual report, only very limited use is being made by bishops of Relief Society presidents in this capacity. The annual report reveals an average of only two family analyses per year per ward being made under the direction of the bishops. There were seven stakes reporting not one single analysis by a Relief Society president in any of their respective wards during the entire year. There were forty-two stakes reporting five or fewer visits throughout the entire stake during the year. The stake reporting the largest number showed an average of less than one visit per month per ward. We feel this is particularly unfortunate in t hat an unnecessary burden is placed upon bishops which ward Relief Society presidents are willing and qualified to carry. Not only this, but through bishops failing to so use Relief Society presidents, Relief Society is prevented from fulfilling instructions given it by Priesthood authorities which are basic in carrying out fundamental principles of the Welfare Program. In an address to Relief Society sisters at t he Relief Society general conference last October, Elder Harold B. Lee said: We are failing in this Welfare Program if and when we have mothers of homes receiving assistance who are able-bodied and can do so, when they are not brought into the production assignments, in sewing and breadmaking and rug weaving. You sisters must see to it that all able-bodied persons, whose home conditions permit them to do so, be brought in to help to be producers in that program from which they receive sustenance. We fail in that, and we fail in one of the prime requirements of the Welfare Program. Even though they may not be able to come to your centers, even though it may require someone being sent into their homes to teach them if they cannot come to a center, you presidents should see to it that someone teach-es them, and they have work to do in their own homes where they may have to be surrounded by their own children. In harmony with this advise we have instructed ward presidents that when a family is receiving assistance, 308 the mother should, if she is physically able, be brought into the production program. If, because of small children or for some other legitimate reason, she cannot leave her home to sew at the work meeting or to assist with the canning program, she should do some sewing at home, if only to make the clothing which she and her own family will use. If she doesn't know how to sew, Relief Society has a responsibility to teach her. Ifa sister needs a house dress, rather than to give her an order on the bishops' storehouse for a dress some other sister has made, it is far better and in line with Church teachings to provide material and allow or teach her to make the dress herself. This would reserve the house dress in the storehouse for a sister who is physically unable to make her own. If such a policy were followed, it would lessen the heavy sewing load being placed at the present time on members of the Society who are contributing such service in addition to performing their own arduous home duties. It would also encourage the sister in need to become more independent. How many beautiful baby layettes have been made and turned into our storehouses to be drawn out on bishops' orders! Every prospective mother has a right to the joy and development that comes from creating these tiny garments herself. Because so much love and happiness do accompany the making of these tiny articles, we have no right to deny a mother the opportunity to make her own. When we advise our Relief Society presidents to help those in need to make their own clothing, how often do we hear: "How can we do this, since the bishop does not call upon us to assist in making family analyses; we do not know the families for whom he is caring nor their respective needs? We cannot bring these mothers into the production program, neither can we assist them to wisely use the substance supplied by the bishop, as we do not know who they are." We feel that Relief Society could be of inestimably greater service to bishops and to the Program as a whole if our women were called into a regular weekly Welfare meeting where their vision would be enlarged and their understanding of their relationship to the bishops and the Welfare Program increased; where they might make regular reports and receive assignments, where they might be (as Brother Lee has expressed) "intelligent, inspired participants in the planning of the Welfare partnership." We do not wish to go beyond that which we are assigned, but we are sincerely anxious to fulfill the part that has been assigned to Relief Society under the Welfare Plan and to do all in our power to help the bishops and to forward this great and inspired work. May our Heavenly Father help us to this end I pray. Letters to President Grant From His Mother Rachel Grant Taylor MONG President Grant's personal papers are about fifty letters from his mother, written from 1877 to 1895, when he was traveling, or while she was away from home. These letters were written in the fine script of that day and averaged about four pages in length. Brief excerpts from some of these letters give a glimpse of the desires of President Grant's mother regarding his course in life. In January 1877, Rachel R. Grant, mother of President Heber J. Grant, went to St. George to stay for several months with her sister Anna Ivins, mother of President Anthony W. Ivins. On April 6th of that year the St. George Temple was dedicated. However, there was a dedication of a number of rooms in the building on January 1, 1877, so that endowment work might be carried on. St. George�Feb. 12, 77 Aunt Anna is writing to Uncle Ise, I thought I would write a few lines and that would do for my weekly letter. There is such a good spirit in St. George. You will never know how thankful I feel to think you and Tony are such good Mormons. Tony is not in the house sitting down five minutes without the Bible, Book of Mormon or Doc. And Cov. He is a splendid good boy. I am going to commence doing some work for our dead. I never began to realize about the redemption of the dead until I came here. 1 intend to do all I can to help forward the temple in my weak way. If I had money that is where I would put it. Give my love to all especially Richard, accept much for yourself from your loving Ma. St. George�March 77 My Dear Heber,. I received your welcome letter, but do not think of coming down on horseback this time of year. Tony said if you started, you would not get farther than Provo, I wouldn't have you attempt it. I would love very much to have you come, but not bad enough to have you come on horseback, besides it would cost you so much. Try and come with someone that is coming. I have been at the temple helping to celebrate Bro. Woodruff's 7oth birthday. There were upwards of 100 sisters went through the temple for his dead. Heber J. Grant was made president of the Tooele Stake in October 1880, before he was twenty-four years of age. Ina letter from St. George in 1881 the mother wrote to her son: St. George, Mar. 2, 1881 My Dear Heber, You speak of your being so good for nothing. You were very trying sometimes, and so are most children. I was too. I never forget my childhood days and the patience of my mother and her kind ways, and cousin J. W.�and the cross and scolding way his wife had. I feel different towards her now, and thankful, she learned me to work. I know my jolly way tried her Quaker way. I heard her tell cousin J. Once I was always singing. He replied "T love to hear her." After that I would go down in the garden and sing where | thought no one but my Heavenly Father would hear me�hymns my mother learned me. I sing them now sometimes in honor of her dear memory. I could always see Page 309 310 the good in you and nothing very bad. When Sister H. Would be so tried, I would say, "He will make a good man." She speaks of it many times since then when she would be so tried with N. And think I was too easy. I would say you thought the same of Heber, and he has made a good man. I always try to look at the good as well as the bad traits, and see which predominate. I see my own weak points and pray the Lord to show them to me, and help me to overcome them. On October 6, 1882, Heber J. Grant was called by revelation to be an apostle and he became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve just before his twenty-sixth birthday. In 1884, while her son was doing missionary work in Arizona with Brigham Young Jr., Rachel Grant commenced her letter as follows: Salt Lake City, Nov. 22, 1884 My Dear Heber: I thought I would write and wish you many happy returns of your birthday. That you may live long, be blessed with health and great wisdom, much of the Spirit of the Lord, and every other attribute that tends to ennoble and exalt men in this life and the next, is ever the wish and prayer of your Mother. A mother's justifiable pride in the achievements of her son, and interesting and valuable comments on her own philosophy of life are revealed in the letters which follow: Soda Springs, July 30, 85 My Dear Heber, The more good we can do for others the better we feel, whether it is appreciated or not. If we feel that we are pleasing our Heavenly Father that brings a good feeling. I think more of pleasing him than anyone else. I feel rewarded in this life for all I have passed through. To have you feel as you do and in the position you have been honored with. My daily prayer is that you may never do anything to dishonor your position. It was always my greatest desire that you might be useful in God's kingdom. It brings joy in this life and everlasting happiness in the life to come. I love a whole soul saint. March 1895 My Dear Heber: I often feel the Lord has blessed me more than I deserve when I think of his calling you to the position you occupy. It was my constant prayer before you were born, and after, that I might have a noble spirited child who would devote his life to the kingdom. May his choicest blessing attend you and yours is ever the wish of your devoted Mother. It is interesting to note that President Grant and his mother were members of the same ward for fifty years and they were very closely associated. During the time that President Grant was acting as president of the Japanese Mission, his mother wrote to him frequently and her letters were a source of comfort and inspiration. Copies of these letters are carefully bound in President Grant's letter books, showing how much he appreciated and loved the messages sent to him by his loving and faithful mother. Canine HEIGHTS Evelyn Fijeldsted Could there be heights of joy in the world Where peace above all else is treasured, Except there be depths where time disciplines, Depths from which heights must be measured. Pioneer Cookery Beatrice K. Ekman WHEN the persecuted saints were driven from their homes in Nauvoo in the dead of winter to brave the sweeping blasts of the wilderness storms, they took for their cooking equipment their iron pots and bake-kettles, skillets, and brass buckets, great and small. They cooked at the camp-fire and slept in flimsy ground shelters or in the camp wagons, grouped together for safety, along the swampy river basins, with only the slender re-sources of the camp to protect them from the rigorous snow and sleet of winter. They suffered the pangs of hunger and were reduced to the most meager fare, and days on end they had nothing but water gruel, for which they gave thanks. After they had eaten their scant fare they gathered before the bonfires and sang and were merry- When they reached the gathering place at Winter Quarters and built their one-room sod houses or dug-outs, they made their fireplaces of sod with the grass side turned to the fire. Here they cooked by means of the bake-kettles and other iron pots. The bake-kettle was an iron pot with three short legs and a heavy convex iron lid. It could be set directly on a bed of coals raked out to the side of the fireplace. The biscuits, corn bread, loaves, or cake were put in, the lid put on, and a shovelful of live coals placed on top. Pioneers used to say that nothing baked in a cookstove ever tasted so good as the things that came out of a bake-kettle in the fireplace. Meat was either cooked in the bake-kettle or broiled over the red-hot coals. If one did not have a bake-kettle, corn bread and corn dodgers could be cooked on hot rocks in front of the fire. The Indians used this method for their corn bread. In the early spring of 1847, when the first company of pioneers left Winter Quarters for the long trek across the plains, they were well pre-pared and organized. One historian has said: The organization and order in the camp was so perfect that not infrequently, half an hour after a halt, the people sat down to a comfortable meal of broiled meat and fresh bread. They baked their bread as soon as the fires were made and the bake-kettle hot, having mixed the dough on the way in the top of the sack of flour. For sour-milk biscuits, how-ever, they stirred soda into a cup of sour milk and poured that into the flour, added a little salt, and mold-ed the biscuits with quick fingers. They were ready for the oven in about the time it takes to toast a piece of bread in an electric toaster. Corn bread was also made and baked in the same fashion. There was an abundance of wild game and wild geese, ducks, prairie chickens, and turkeys which were sometimes killed by the camp hunters. From the streams they obtained fish and, along the banks, they found 312  wild berries and red currants and yellow and black native currants, bullberries, gooseberries and strawberries. The fruit, together with pigweeds and thistles, helped to vary their diet. When the pioneers were in timber country they burned the wood that they could obtain along the way. On the plains they burned sagebrush, which they found at times growing ten feet high. When there was no other fuel they used the dry buffalo chips, as long ago the wandering tribes on the Arabian desert used the dry dung of camels for fuel. When wild game was plentiful, Brigham Young advised against unnecessary slaughter. The hunters kept the camps well supplied with buffalo, elk, antelope, and deer meat. After one big kill, the camps laid over to dry the buffalo meat in the hot sun. The lean meat was cut into strips and dried. This method was learned from the Indians. In June the company found their flour almost exhausted and more was miraculously procured from a company of Oregon emigrants which an advance group of pioneers ferried across the Platte River in a skiff. These emigrants paid them $1.50 for each wagon and load ferried over. They paid in flour at $2.50 for each hundred pounds, when flour, at that time, was selling at $10 for a hundred pounds. This flour was divided among all members of the camp and it amounted to five and one-half pounds for each person. "It looked as much of a miracle to me," wrote Wilford Woodruff, "to see our flour and meal bags replenished in the Black Hills, as it did to have the children of Israel fed with manna in the wilderness." When Jim Bridger ate breakfast with Bigham Young on the plains, he said he had seen more bread on Brigham Young's table that morning than he had seen in years. HEN the pioneers entered the Valley they planted all the seed that they had brought for that purpose. Flour and meal were scarce and supplies were carefully husbanded. They dug sego roots, Jerusalem artichokes (perennial, sunflowers), and gathered pigweeds, thistles, and dock to supplement the lack of flour. The land for miles around was dug up for sego-lily bulbs and thistles and some of the pioneers were poisoned by eating wild onion roots which they mistook for sego roots. In the spring of 1848 flour was scarce and many suffered with hunger and they had to boil rawhide for soup. Lorenzo Young, after sharing his last pound of flour with someone less fortunate, was without meat and flour. He traded a yoke of large oxen for a beef that a California emigrant had saved. He was to give the man, also, a quarter of the beef when he had slaughtered it. He did this and hung the hide on bushes, with the meat side out, and the magpies feasted on it. The beef lasted some time and then he was again without food. He took the hide from the bush, cut it into strips and soaked it in City Creek until it was soft. He worked over it for two days cleaning it by scraping the hair and dirt from it, then he turned it over to his wife and she made glue soup of it. She set her table attractively with a favorite set of dishes she had brought from Nauvoo, and placed the dish of soup in the center of the table with a ladle to convey it to the PIONEER COOKERY plates. They blessed the soup and gave thanks. This was one instance of many when people were obliged to eat this fare. After the harvest of 1849 times were better. The people were thrifty and the gold seekers on their way to California brought in many delicacies. There was wild game in the hills, wild geese and ducks on the sloughs and - springs, crops were good, and the Pioneers began to Prosper. There was an abundance of green vegetables of every variety, cucumbers. Their with the best of and melons and tables groaned foods.. Could be used 'was thrown away. If a beef was slaughtered, the hide was tanned for leather, the hoofs boiled for glue, and the intestines were washed and scraped to be fried in butter. They were considered quite a delicacy and were called chitterlings. The other intestines were used for casings for sausage and headcheese, 'The bladder was used for casing lard. The stomach was used for tripe. The meat that was not used fresh was Pickled in salt brine for corned beef, and there was no waste surplus. If any one slaughtered an animal he traded with a neighbor, and the neighbor did the same in his turn. The housewife was expert in making cheese, butter, lard, and sausage from pork, salting down meat, and making soap and candles. Grease from the cooking and other refuse fats was stored away during the winter and the lye for soapmaking was 313 leached from the wood ashes that were saved from winter fires, The Soap was made in the spring. A leach tub or barrel was filled with the ashes and the water Poured in a little at a time until the lye seeped out from a hole in the barrel near the base. It was repeatedly poured back over the ashes and the ashes renewed until the lye was strong enough, then the lye and fat were poured into the huge brass kettle and boiled until done over a fire in the open. Saleratus was also used in place of lye for soap. En the lye was rendered and the fat was poured off, the leftovers were saved for cracklings. These were rolled into the dough and baked in flat sheets. The wood lye was also used for making the lye hominy, This was an essential food and a favorite supper or breakfast dish either fried with bacon or eaten in a bowl of milk. The hominy, as well as the sauerkraut, was always made in the fall, Headcheese, calves' or Pigs' feet jelly and Sausage were also made in the fall. Tomatoes were cooked and poured into five gallon coal oil cans and the lid screwed on and sealed with beeswax. The potatoes were stored in pits, as were also carrots, Parsnips, and cabbage. The cabbage was stored with the roots above the ground. These pits could be opened on a favorable day and the desired supplies removed, in the summer, Starch was made by grating peeled starch spread on sheets to dry. This starch was used for cooking as well as for laundering. The milk was kept in springhouses. The bladders of lard, the 314 headcheese, and sausage were hung from the ceilings. There was a dirt floor and the walls were whitewashed. 'These springhouses were built of adobes, rocks, or logs, preferably over a stream or spring. Molasses was first made in 1852 but, before this, boiled sugar cane supplied some sweetening. Much cottage cheese was made and was always on the table, as were honey and molasses. Hot milk was a favorite drink for supper. It was not until 1852 that the iron Charter Oak stoves came into use, with their shoe-shaped ovens and four-holed tops. Before this the cooking was done entirely at the fireplace or on open fires outside by means of the bake ovens or iron pots. The stoves were usually set up on bricks or blocks to make them higher. PIONEER RECIPES HEADCHEESE Take one half hog's head and one half beef shank. Scrape clean and remove ears and eyes, cleanse and wash well, Put into small amount of water and boil until meat leaves bones. Chop meat into coarse pieces, season with salt and pepper and place in muslin bag. Press under weight until cold. Remove cloth and slice for serving. SAUSAGE Grind shoulder of pork through sausage grinder. Season with salt, pepper, and garden sage. Shape into small cubes and fry. CALVES' OR PIGS' FEET JELLY After cleansing, boil either feet of a calf or the feet of a pig until tender and the meat has loosened from the bones. Strain through cloth and pour into molds. When cold, serve as dessert with cream and sugar. SCRAPPLE Take the head, heart, or any lean scraps of pork and boil until the meat slips easily from the bones. Remove the fat, gristle, and bones, then chop fine. Set the liquid in which the meat was boiled aside until cold. Then remove the cake of fat from the surface and return the broth to the fire. When it boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with salt and pepper. Let it boil again, then thicken with corn meal as you would in making ordinary corn meal mush by letting it slip through. The fingers slowly to prevent lumps. Cook for one hour, stirring constantly at first, then boil slowly. When done, pour into a long, square pan, not too deep, and mold. Cut into slices when cold, and fry brown, as you do mush. This is a cheap and delicious breakfast dish. LUMPY DICK Take water that is boiling and salted and stir into it, very carefully and slowly, white flour until it reaches the consistency of mush, and serve either cold or hot with cream and sugar.

The two families are to remain in San Juan and, at a point where the Montezuma Creek comes into the San Juan River, are to establish an outpost and prepare for the coming of the main company of settlers, members of the San Juan Mission. The twenty-four scouts are to return to their homes and report their findings. The purpose of the mission is to cultivate and maintain peaceful and friendly relations with the Indians, who are almost the sole occupants of the large isolated country. While driving her team at night, across a sultry; menacing desert, Elizabeth has a frightening experience with a mysterious Indian. She feels that she will see the Indian again and that he will know if she needs help.. The company travels over rough and dangerous country. They cross the Colorado River, overcome the dangers of a steep ridge called Lee's Hogback, and continue their journey into the desert. After much suffering, the company finally reaches Moenkopi, an Indian outpost and a supply point for traders and pioneers. 'The Davis family remains at Moenkopi and the others go on toward the San Juan. They reach what seems to loom as an impenetrable forest of giant greasewood trees, mysterious and forbidding in the twilight. Elizabeth covers her face to shut out the sight of it, and she is glad that Mary is safe at Moenkopi. OR half a day the well diggers worked steadily, but without success. Road crews had rigged up a ten foot V-shaped wedge from a forked cedar tree and, with it hooked to four yoke of thick-necked steers, they attacked the greasewood forest. The tangled growth went down, snapping like green logs in a furnace, while splinters corduroyed the sand. George Hobbs sat his horse like a statue, not far from the workers at the well, paying little attention to the road builders. "I'm a born road builder," Silas Smith announced, watching the huge wedge as it mowed the thicket down. "Any doubts in your mind about that, George?" "My job seems to be well-digging, though I was not, fortunately, born to it. Scouting is a more interesting vocation. Any doubts in your mind about that?" George turned to grin engagingly at his superior officer. "Maybe you think I'm not a born scout, either?" "I'm just wondering about that," Silas said, and there was a frown between his deep-set eyes. "Where are all the Lamanites you said were following us?" George glanced uneasily at the thicket. Divining the direction of George's thoughts, Silas gave way to his own sense of insecurity, a feeling that had persisted despite the apparently calm scene of the morning's work. George, whose eyes had not left Page 315 the thicket, nodded ever so slightly toward a clump of trees to the left of the wedge and the swath it was breaking. Out of the trees, scarcely ten feet from where Silas was standing, emerged a single blanketed figure. "How!" The Indian guttural, stripped of all friendliness, was packed with menace. The Indian strode toward the well. Silas stood where he was, angry and ill at ease. George had been right. They were surrounded. Elizabeth, seeing the tall Indian at the well, dropped the canvas flap down over the front of her wagon, where her children sat in trained quietness. With the memory of that night in the Arizona desert to reassure her, she watched the fellow with fearless interest. THE DOUBLE-O ARCH This arch is the most unusual, if not the best known, of the sixty-four arches in the Devil's Garden section of the Arches National Monument, near Moab, Utah. WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT This Indian, she knew, had not come to beg. There was certainly no apology in his bearing. George Hobbs sat immobile, keeping his horse quiet by the pressure of his knees, ignoring the Indian completely. 'There was no sign that even his thoughts had been disturbed by the surly Piute. The work at the well, the raising and lowering of the big buckets that came up and down as the windlass turned, was all that seemed to interest him. The windlass brought up a bucket of earth. As it was dumped, he reached down from his saddle and took a handful of it, testing it for dampness between his fingers. Then he straightened up, still not looking toward the Indian. The bucket was dumped and went down again. The process fascinated the Piute. Hobbs let another handful of sand strain through his fingers. Elizabeth, watching him, detected an almost imperceptible quiver of his nostrils, and knew the well-diggers would soon strike water. The Piute seemed to smell the dampness. He leaned over and looked into the well pit. Then he straightened. Up and flung out his arm in an unmistakable signal. It was answered by two hundred scowling replicas of himself. Springing into existence from behind rocks, trees, and the tangle of greasewood, they crowded around the well. "Get into the thicket with that road," Silas yelled. ""We're going to need it, pronto!" There was a shout from the bot- 'tom of the well: "Here she comes! Bail us out!" Four men grabbed the windlass and began to turn it. There was 317 another shout from the well, "Hurry, she's comin' fast!" The Indians fell back, pushing over each other in their haste. The white men began to cheer. Elizabeth grabbed a bucket, and, shoving the Indians out of her way, she drew up the first pailful of muddy water. THREE days away from the nerve-straining camp at the greasewood forest, the travelers had hoped that the Indians would be miles away, too. Instead, they had increased in numbers. Squaws, papooses, dogs, and ponies had joined the original band, and now trailed after the wagons. Sullenly watchful, came the males. The squaws followed, shrieking into the canyons and calling vengeance upon the whites. Not bothering to beg, they helped themselves to the company's food, cleaned out the grass with their cayuses, drank the water from the pockets in the rocks, and dared the whites to like it or not. "How long are we goin' to stand for this, President Smith?" Hamilton Thornton asked, as he and four others of the drivers rode up to their leader. "What water the Indians can't drink, they pollute," he cried. "We're in for shootin' them back!" "That's right!" flinging dust and sand into the already charged air, Thornton's friends rode forward. "You men came along with this outfit to shoot game, not Indians," Captain Smith said, meeting them squarely. "Fire one shot, and those squaws will tear us limb from limb." "They're foul with smells," Thornton grumbled. "We can't stand it!" 318 "And the noise!" one of the others cried. "It'll drive us crazy." "It's when they're quiet that I start goose-pimples," Silas said, and grinned engagingly. 'Then he turned to regard the squaws, and concluded, "When they're raisin' cain like this I know that no real devilment is brewing. Now, you, Parley, and you, Hans; keep the rest of those hotheads cool, will you? And get back into your place in the line." Kicking up clouds of dirt before and behind the train, the squaws, bareheaded in the blazing sun, set their dogs on the company horses and crowded their own ponies in milling dozens ahead on the trail until, tired of entertaining themselves, they finally became quiet, let their ponies amble where they would, nursed their babies, and slept in the wake of their own dust. Believing that now, at last, the Indians would fall back and be gone, the company picked up its spirits. What were cliffs and canyons, ledges and rocks, against the screeching of that dirty pack of squaws and the imprecations of the scowling bucks? Now they could hear their own voices, the footfalls of their own horses, and they discovered that it was music. The trail writhed in and out of canyons, around cap rocks that became tam-o-shanters, over windswept ledges, and back into canyons again. For an hour Elizabeth reveled in its grandeur, pointing out red elephants that marched in profile along the cliffs, tall goblets that sparkled in the sun, church towers, and engine rocks that stood panting after their long climb up from the valley floor, shimmering with heat smoke that trailed after them back into the canyon again. Henry Harriman tied his lines to the wagon bow and came to sit beside Elizabeth. "I never saw anything like it, Bethy," he said. "This place just isn't earth. Its castles and domes, clouds and mirrors, and whispering winds." "Yes," Elizabeth agreed. "But at night, in the moonlight, there is a feeling I can't describe. Everything seems weird and unreal. And when all this warmth and color are gone these queer forms become ghosts. Don't all these overhanging cliff dwellings make you feel creepy?" "Nota bit! If San Juan's like this I�ll not be sorry I left Southern Utah." They fell silent then, stirred by the thoughts that he mention of home had brought. "It's a good thing we brought along all the water we could haul from the well," Henry said after a while. He scanned the sun for the time of day and concluded, "It looks like we'll have a dry camp tonight. We can't go much farther, and there is no water here." "If we get rid of the Indians, I'll not care whether I have a drink or not," Elizabeth answered. "They've been falling back for an hour, now," Henry said. "I wouldn't be surprised if we've seen the last of them." He gave Elizabeth a bouquet of velvet-white yucca blossoms, patted her hand encouragingly, and went back to his own team. Hours later the company was halted on a small plateau that narrowed to a neck and then dropped off into a dark canyon. It was stifling hot. Elizabeth WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT hoarded the water carefully, not daring to cool the children's faces, as she usually did. Their eyes were red and swollen from the heat and the pelting sand; their lips were cracked and dry. "Oh, my darlings," Elizabeth soothed them. "Mother knows you are hot and tired. But see, down there in the valley! That's a lake. Tomorrow my five precious ones shall wade in the water. You can splash it over your bodies. You can lie down in it..." Elizabeth and Henry, two gray figures between earth and sky, felt the night close in. 'Though neither voiced the fear, both were worried about the descent into the canyon. Exit or not, once down, there would be no climbing back up this crumbly ledge. "Isn't there any other way off this mesa?" Elizabeth asked, trying to sound casual. "George says not," Henry answered reluctantly. "Then there isn't," she said flatly, not without hope, but as an acceptance of fact. Henry put his arm around her shoulders and with his free hand took hold of her locked fingers. "Bethy," he said, hesitant and tender, "I'm not good at speeches, but I want you to know that I'd not be doing this wilderness-taming if it weren't for the Church." He looked at the sky, close with stars. "God's pretty near right now, it seems to me, and when we're miles away, down there, well, he'll be down there, too," he finished diffidently and kissed her finger tips. Elizabeth's eyes swam with tears. It took but one moment like this to 319 keep a woman at her man's side for a lifetime. There was the tinkle of a bell in the distance where the horses were grazing.... AS soon as it was light, the men were out making a road, and by noon they had a narrow dugway halfway down from the mesa. Things were going far better than had been expected. But, suddenly, there was a lull in the voices of the road crew, in the clank of tools. "What is it?" Elizabeth cried, running to meet Henry as he came up the dugway. "A twenty-five foot jump-off. We've struck a ledge!" he cried. "A hunk of rock as hard as granite!" "Can't they blast it back?" Elizabeth questioned. "The whole face of the mesa would slide off if we tried it. We'll have to chisel it off by hand." "Then it may be hours." Elizabeth turned to go back to her wagon. "More likely it'll be all night, Sis," George said, riding up in time to hear her last words. "And no water?" Elizabeth asked. "Nota drop! And no water pockets in the rocks, either." Sudden, homesick tears filled Elizabeth's eyes. What a heaven of love and happiness she had left. Here it was so hot. At home there would be a breeze in the cottonwoods. She looked at the nub of a candle that stood in its bracket ready to be lighted. At home there would be lights in every window of the town. But she would never see them again! She dropped her head to her arms and began to cry. The children came in from their 320 play and were hungry. She fed them and put them to bed. Then she walked away from the camp and stood looking up at the stars. "Father, help this parcel of human beings," she prayed. "Help these tired men to chisel back this stubborn ledge. And please, please, let nothing happen to the water in the canyon below." It was noon before the ledge gave way to the hammers of the weary men, and a road, looking like a long wounded worm, was chiseled to the bottom of the canyon. Elizabeth, ready with her team and wagon and her children, looked down the dugway in front of her, and a faint nausea attacked the pit of her stomach. The canyon was so far below! And there was nothing but dizzy space to look into! "Drive slow, and don't crowd the wall," Silas said to her in a low, assuring voice. "You are a good seamstress, Mrs. Harriman." Elizabeth smiled gratefully, afraid to speak for fear she would betray the giddiness that kept her head swimming. Silas looked her wagon and harnesses over carefully, tested the pin in the singletrees, and went on. Henry came to Elizabeth's side of the wagon. Weary from the long night of road work and anxious for her safety, he cast around for something to say that might help her or give courage. The answer lay in Elizabeth's parched and_ swollen lips. "We'll have water soon, Bethy," he promised. "Drive steady, my girl." Elizabeth nodded. Thank goodness she was next to the lead wagon. If any of the outfits got down safely it would be the first ones. 'That gave the children a chance. "All right, Brother Decker, lead out!"" Silas Smith called. And the first wagon began its slow descent. Elizabeth released her brake, gave the lines a gentle lift, and took a long, deep breath. Then she followed the first wagon down the steep and narrow dugway, looking straight ahead, keeping her eyes glued to the little round opening in the back of the Decker wagon. Through it she could see James Decker's quiet shoulders. When the last wagon had made the descent and had joined the others in the valley, Elizabeth said to her husband as he walked beside her team, leaving his own to follow, "Henry that was the easiest driving I ever did." Henry drew his hand across his eyes and coughed the tightness from his throat. "It was a hazardous piece of driving, girl. One wagon out of control would have sent the whole face of the cliff sliding to the bottom, a mountain of shale and broken wagons and people." He coughed again. '""That's one place I never want to see again!" "IT wish we could go faster, Henty," Elizabeth fretted. "We are so thirsty. And we are still a long way from water. I gave the children the last drop in the canteen just before we started down." "You shouldn't have!" Henry cried in consternation. "Never use the last drop of water till you can touch the next!" "Why do you say that, Henry, with water right in sight?" "Tt's just natural caution," he answered. "Just plain common sense." Then, seeing her alarm, he added hastily, "But don't worry. This can- WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT yon is flat and smooth. We will roll up to the lake in no time." The teams, needing no urging toward the water, trotted down the canyon. Elizabeth struggled against an overpowering desire to sleep. Just to drop the lines from her aching hands and go to sleep. Her throat ached and her, head was still light. "Careful, there, Elizabeth," her brother warned as he rode the line. "One step into a hole or between these flat rocks could break a horse's leg." "Tl not sleep, George," Elizabeth promised, and tightened her grip on the lines. "But I'm praying we get to that water soon." The canyon narrowed to a mere corridor at the shore of the lake, leaving a door-wide vista of blue against the leaning cliffs that were reflected in the water. The tilted shadows made the lake look like a mirror hung on the walls of a rust-colored room. On the shore stood a lone heron, like a china statue, and it, too, was mirrored in the lake. The walls of the canyon, so close: to the corridor, 321 changed to vermillion, to blue, to lavender, and back to dull rust shades again. It was a breath-taking scene, but Elizabeth saw only the water. She knew that if she were to throw herself into it, face down, she would be cool, her lips would be wet with it, and her tongue would cease to choke her. Would the command to halt never came, she wondered. Had she only dreamed of this wonderful place? "Halt!" 'The command was sharp and imperative. Elizabeth whirled in her wagon seat. She had never heard such a tone in Silas Smith's voice before. Every wagon jammed to a standstill. The teams and stock threatened a stampede toward the water. "DearGod, what now?" she prayed. Water was there. She could see it, she could smell it on the wind, almost she could touch it with her hand. Yet they were stopped dead against it. She buried her face in her hands. She could not bear the picture of the lake. (To be continued ) NOSTALGIA Merling Dennis Clyde My heart cries out in springtime when redbuds start to flame; When lily leaves, upthrusting, spring's recurrent hopes proclaim, My eager, homesick longing for the hills will be the same; When prescient April holds flower-ladened arms to May, And air so freshly fragrant soothes winter's doubts away, A thousand vagrant breezes will call my feet to stray. And when those hills of homeland, With dogwood blooms of white, Along the winding uptrail, appear in radiant light, A mist of tears will silver the beauty of the sight. NOTES AND NEWs.

Women�s Sphere Ramona W. Cannon M1 "RS. MARGARET MERRILL FISHER, a granddaughter of Bathslieba W. Smith, fourth General President of Relief Society, died recently. As a young girl, Mrs. Fisher raised silkworms, spun the silk thread, and created the designs for the lovely lace made by her own hands. She also compiled a history of the Utah volunteer expeditions concerning the men who< fought in the Civil War. This volume was officially recognized by the United States Government. MRS. EFFIE DIGGE FIOUTZ, an Indian of Blackfoot, Idaho, is striving to inspire young Indian women to keep alive the arts, manual skills, and exquisite designs (developed from the "shifting moods" of moon, stars, sun, and mountain
peaks) that are traditional among Indian tribes, but are now rapidly vanishing. Already, native basket weaving is a lost art. (As high a price as $10,000 has been paid for the exquisite baskets of the famous, now deceased, Daht-so-la-le.) Mrs. Houtz's own beautiful creations have been exhibited and sold at the Biltmore in Los Angeles and at Marshall Field's in Chicago. MISS MITTIE ARNOLD and Miss Margaret E. Thomas started an herb garden a few years ago, as a hobby. They now have one of the largest and most famous herb farms in the United States, at Greene, R. I. SUSAN B. ANTHONY (1820-1906) fought for equality between men and women as to wages, education, suffrage, and property rights. At the time, "women owned nothing, not even their own wedding presents," and "controlled nothing, not even their own children." One newspaper commented: "As is the yellow fever to the South, the grasshopper to t he plains, the diphtheria to our northern cities, so is Susan B. Anthony and her class to all true, pure, lovely women." Before her death, Miss Anthony was pelted with roses while driving through a street where, many years earlier, the missiles had been eggs. This year, observance of her birthday was provided by law in California, Colorado, and Minnesota. In the latter State an act was passed in the legislative session of 1941 establishing Susan B. Anthony Day, to be observed by appropriate recognition in public schools and by the display of our flag on public buildings and schools. MISS CORNELIA M. VAN ASCH VAN WIJCK, of Holland, is president of the world Y. W. C. A. Formerly a wealthy aristocrat, she endured the poverty and starvation common to the Dutch during the war. Her great effort now is to bring help to the children of Europe, who have had their minds and characters "warped and twisted by hatreds and deceptions." The Mother as a Teacher PERHAPS the most important role which a mother is called upon to play is that of a teacher of her children. From the time that a child is born, the mother teaches him both by precept and example. The teachings carry over into the remainder of his life, and in times of stress and temptation there should arise in the child's mind either the admonitory words of his mother or the remembrance of her as she advocated certain actions in support of eternal principles. The child uses as his first standard of a home the one in which he lives. If it is a home whose appearance is orderly, clean, and attractive, he will have a pattern whereby he will judge the homes of his playmates. If, on homes, his own will be revealed in his eyes in an unfavorable light. A mother should teach, by her homemaking, the type of home which is in harmony with prophet living as taught by the gospel and, by setting such a standard, a mother will teach her children to establish and maintain like homes. How often one hears the expression, "Well, what could you expect, that was the kind of home in which she was reared?" Many a young man has been advised, in choosing a wife, to notice the character and habits of the mother of the young lady whom he Page 324 admires, the better to judge the manner in which she has been reared. Important as ls the appearance of a home, however, there is also the spirit of the home with which a mother must concern herself and which she largely builds. 'There may out, in each in which the dispute might have been settled amicably. Habits of industry and thrift will be inculcated in children if taught by the insistence and example of the e mother who idles away her time at home and spends these habits reflected in her children to give even less. There is a great and grave responsibility resting upon parents to "reach their children to walk up rightly before the mother's part of this responsibility VOL. 34 MAY 1947 
Here is the exact OCR transcription of the text:
is one for which she will be held strictly accountable, and one which she cannot, in righteousness, shift to the shoulders of another.
It would be impossible to measure the effort which a mother puts into the teaching of her children; it would likewise be impossible to measure the joy which comes to a mother through seeing her teachings reflected in the righteous and outstanding lives of her children. The proper teaching of her children is the foremost duty of any mother and nothing should be allowed to interfere, hamper, nor impair such teaching to the detriment of the eternal welfare of her children.
