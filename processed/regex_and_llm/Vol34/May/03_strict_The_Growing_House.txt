THE GROWING HOUSE
Erma Barney Busack
My neighbor had a little house That grew and grew and grew. It was so very small At first, it fitted only two.
Soon, another room was added When the children came; A porch and bedroom soon appeared. It didn't look the same.
And now I see they're building, The little house must grow, For the children are all married� Grandchildren, you know.
And, now, three generations find Within the house so small How grand that such a tiny house So much of love embraces! Notes to THE FIELDSubscription Price Raised to $1.50 as of July 1, 1947 NOTWITHSTANDING the loyalty of Relief Society women throughout the Church who have made possible the phenomenal increase in Magazine subscriptions which now total over 83,000, the General Board finds it necessary, as of July 1, 1947, to increase the annual subscription price from $1 to $1.50. This increase in subscription price has been made necessary because of steadily increasing paper, publishing, and circulation costs which have, for the past four years, been so high as to make it impossible for the Magazine to be selfsupporting. The only sources of income for the Magazine are subscriptions and advertising, which has been held to a minimum during and since the war years because of the acute paper shortage. The General Board regrets having to take this action since the subscription price of the official publication of the Society has been maintained at $1 per year since 1889. Every effort has been made to keep the Magazine self-supporting and to retain the $1 rate through a most careful watch over expenditures, and through editorial and other workers giving excessive hours of service. However, in spite of all that has been done, costs have advanced so much as to make an increase in price absolutely necessary. Magazine representatives are advised that all subscriptions sent to the General Board on or after July 1, 1947 are to be charged for at the increased rate of $1.50 per year. All subscriptions received at the General Board office which are post office dated on or before June 30, 1947 will require only the $1 rate. We wish to thank the many thousands of subscribers to the Magazine and the Magazine representatives who have served so faithfully and well, and we solicit their continued support for this Magazine of the women of the Church, for if the number of subscriptions should drop below the present circulation, it would be impossible, under existing conditions, to continue publication without financial loss, even at the increased subscription price of $1.50. Summer Work Meetings It is the desire of the General Board that a work meeting be held each month, as heretofore, during the summer period, June through September. In these stressful times, Church Welfare sewing should take precedence over all other work. The Magazine Honor Roll for 1946 Counselor Marianne C. Sharp THE General Board wishes to congratulate the stakes and missions of the Church for the outstanding work they have done during the year 1946 in putting Theinto the homes of members of the Relief Society as well as into the homes of many women who are not members of the Church. One of the great desires of the General Board is that the Magazine may serve as a missionary in making friends for the Church. The number of Magazine subscriptions has steadily increased during 1946. In 1945 there were 1102  Number Missions on Honor Roll � The stake which has achieved the highest per cent of subscriptions in relation to the enrolled membership of Relief Society ls North Idaho Falls Stake with a percentage of 155. There are 35 other stakes which have made outstanding records of 100 pet cent or Over. Idaho Falls Seventh Ward of the North Idaho Falls Stake stands at the head of all the wards in the Church with a percentage of 239- There is a total of 497 wards throughout the Church that have made 100 per cent or over. The mission making the highest percentage is the Australian with 139 per cent. There are two missions Total Number Magazine Subscriptions Number Stakes on Honor Roll names on the honor roll; this year there are 1274 names, which indicates a substantial increase in the number of Magazine representatives who have obtained subscriptions equal to or in excess of 75 percent of the enrolled Relief Society membership. The General Board is very pleased, in recognition of the work of Magazine representatives who have obtained a 75 per cent rating or higher in 1946, to award them a free one year Magazine subscription. The following table indicates the growth during the past year 1945 1946 74,032 79,003  with a percentage of 100 or over. The mission district of the Church with the highest pet cent is the Alabama District of the Southern States Mission with 135 Percent. In all he missions there are five districts which have a rating of 100 pet cent or Over. Glen Huon Branch of the Australian Mission is the top-ranking branch, with a percentage of 400. Branches to the number of 157 have reached 100 per cent oF OVET: Sisters of all these localities are t9 be congratulated for the loyalty and appreciation they manifest for the Magazine of the women of the Church.

350 Instructions to Magazine Representatives and Subscribers. Orders should be legibly written, preferably in ink or typewritten. Names, streets, and cities should be spelled correctly. Street numbers should be accurate, not "about". Correct city and state should be given. Many times there are cities by the same name in more than one state. Subscriptions should be renewed in the same name as the original subscription. Confusion is caused when a subscription is sent in the individual's given name one year and in her husband's name the next year. When there is more than one subscriber by the same name in a ward, some further identification should be used, a middle initial, etc. This is especially true in a small town where there are no street addresses. Subscribers should immediately notify the General Board of a change of address. 'The post office does not forward Magazines unless postage is sent and the post office does not return Magazines to the General Board. Subscribers many times miss numbers of the Magazine due to their failure to notify the General Board of change of address. The former address must always accompany the new address. Subscribers should notify the General Board within a month any failure to receive their Magazine.. After July 1, the General Board will be unable to furnish any back numbers. Therefore, all subscriptions must reach the office of the General Board at least a month in advance of expiration. Hereafter, it will not be possible to obtain the July issue in which the previews and the first lessons appear after the month of July. Only the current issue will be furnished. It is suggested that a subscription be taken in the name of the ward and stake Relief Societies for the purpose of binding. The name of the ward and stake must appear on all orders. Lists should be carefully checked to see that money remitted and the names listed on the order agree. Money order or check is the best method of remittance. Magazine representatives are advised against remitting currency. Representatives are permitted to deduct the cost of money orders, but no deduction should be made when personal check is used by the representative. It is suggested that a Magazine representative keep a copy of each order so that mistakes may be better understood and corrected. Page 350 = FROM THE FIELD Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes From the Field" appear in the Magazine for October 1946, page 685. SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GENERAL ACTIVITIES AUSTRALIAN MISSION, MELBOURNE BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY OFFICERS Left to right: Counselor Elsie Kneale; President Edna Ord; Counselor Betty Hodgson. Florence T. Rees, former president, Australian Mission Relief Society, reports that Sister Bartlett was released from her duties as president of the Melbourne Branch Relief Society after serving six years and carrying out a very successful Church Welfare Program. The new presidency are the youngest executives in the mission. Sister Ord and Sister Kneale have acted as part-time missionaries for four years. Sister Hodgson, a university graduate, has been the social science class leader. Sister Rees reports, also, some of the interesting customs of the Australians and the arts and crafts of the country: '"'While quiltmaking is a national art of the American women, I would say knitting is Australia's art. Baby layettes (consisting of vest, slip, dress, jacket, coat, cap, bootees, and shawl) are knitted from beautifully white, soft yarn. They are most attractive. The patterns are varied and are made in exquisite lacy designs. Not only a few, but all babies in Australia are fortunate enough to possess several of these layettes. Knitting is taught in the grade schools. The women knit in the streetcars or in the trains on their way to work. They knit in the theatres, and they use all the free moments they have for knitting. Australia has the best yarn in the world. The climate is similar to that of California. There is no central heating plant in most of the homes. The lovely knitted woolens serve to keep the babies comfortably warm. I would say that Australian babies are beautifully dressed and well nourished."

Packer, President, Oneida Stake Relief Society, reports that the stake Relief Society Centennial History Book was displayed October 13, 1946, in connection with stake conference. The book shows, in pictures and narrative, the progress of the Relief Society in Oneida Stake from the time of the first organization in 1884, at Oxford, Idaho, until the present time. A review of the book was presented by having the pictures thrown -on a screen and talks given on the eight Relief Society Stake boards which have served, each talk being given by a member of one of the particular stake boards represented. Sister Letitia B. Paul, who has served on stake boards for twenty-two years, gave two piano solos. Sister Nancy Jones of Clifton Ward, who was present at the organization at Oxford, told of the event and bore her testimony. Pictures were shown of all presidents of the stake since its organization. President Ora W. Packer told of Centennial anniversary plans, which included tree plantings, ward Centennial programs, Singing Mothers concerts, and other features. One song was rendered by the Riverdale Ward Singing Mothers and two numbers by the stake Singing Mothers. The benediction was given by Sister Nettie T. Christensen, who had been a member of one of the earlier boards, but had moved away from the stake. She is the mother of Harold T. Christensen, the author of the 1941-42, 1944-45, and 1945-46 social science lessons for Relief Society. The stake history book is in two volumes, one containing the stake Relief Society history and the personal history of all the stake board members; the other containing NOTES FROM THE FIELD 353 short histories of the lives of most of the ward Relief Society presidents from the time of the first organization; also pictures and short sketches of the executive officers of all the wards who were serving on March 17, 194?- In all, the book contains approximately 210 pictures and 185 personal histories. The work of preparing the book was largely under the direction of Counselors Ida F. Evans and Leona Forsgren of the present stake board; but Ellen B. Larsen and Anna R. Hawkes, formet stake presidents, have assisted, together with all members of the present stake board. BIG HORN STAKE (WYOMING).

MAKING PROJECT For several years quiltmaking has been an important and popular work meeting project in Park Stake. Among the many faithful workers who have contributed towards Emily La Fonte, eighty-six years old. She has bound over two hundred quilts for the Society and her work is exquisitely neat and beautiful. Sister La Fonte's support of all Relief Society activities Is outstanding and she is very much loved and appreciated by all the members of her ward, EMILY LA FONTE  Elder Henry D. Moyle (Continued from page 303) dividual effort expended�nothing is impossible." In a just cause which most men have thought hopeless and have quit fighting, Henry D. Moyle has just begun the fight. A man with such fighting qualities is certain to have made some people disaffected toward him, but his friends, the friends of righteousness, are legion and, as the Church members come to know him better, they will know him as an able preacher of righteousness, a fearless defender of the faith, and a loyal and powerful advocate of the truth. Such is, in part, the man Henry D. Moyle, whom the Council of the Twelve unanimously accepts into their quorum, and the Church welcomes as one of its leaders should always be the result when energy is expended. Yet, like a dizzily spinning top. Many businesses go 'round in the preparation of advertising and get nowhere. Month after month, the same thing happens again and again and nothing is accomplished by the expenditure of dollars that could be made to produce results. The function of a printing organization today is to help clients to plan printing that builds sales�to take copy and dramatize it, make it so irresistibly attractive that it must naturally draw the reader's attention. The waste of which we speak is often due to lack of understanding. Realization of this has made us sales minded.
