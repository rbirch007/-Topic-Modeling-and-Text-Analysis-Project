A MOTHER'S POEM
Ella J. Coulam
She yearned to write a poem To the rhythm in her heart, But household cares were many; No rhymed lines would start.
She washed a dusty window And ironed dampened clothes, Her work was done in rhythmic beat Which every mother knows.
Her poem was a masterpiece, A home for all to share, Each thought was filled with mother love Which God had planted there. THE HENRY D. MOYLE FAMILY Seated, left to right: Kenneth W.

Moyle, Jr.; Janet Moyle; and Richard Wright Elder Henry D. Moyle�The New Apostle Elder Harold B. Lee Member of the Quorum of the Twelve of the Prophet Moses, characterized an able man as one who feared God, loved the truth, and hated covetousness. As measured by that characterization, Henry D. Moyle, newly sustained member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is an able man�he fears God, loves the truth, and hates covetousness. Again paraphrasing another statement from the scriptures recording the Apostle Paul's Page 302 Jiri! The wise father-in-law appraisal of his beloved Timothy's ancestry�"the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice... And in thee also"�it can also be said that not alone are these qualities to be found in this man whom the Church has honored with the highest position it can bestow, but like qualities were also in his father James H. Moyle and his mother Alice E, Dinwoodey, who are true representatives of the finest pioneer blood of this generation. ELDER HENRY D. MOYLE 
Here is the exact OCR transcription of the text:
Now, to briefly chronicle the history of his life to the present time: He was born in Salt Lake City, April 22, 1889. He received his early education in the schools of Utah and received his bachelor of science degree from the University of Utah, and a law degree from the University of Chicago, and did graduate work at the University of Freiberg in Germany and at Harvard University. His scholastic education was interrupted for three years while he served as a missionary for the Church in Germany. During the first World War he served with distinction as a captain in an infantry division. As an attorney he achieved the high place of United States District Attorney for Utah. His principal business interests have been with the Desert Livestock Company, and with three oil companies, the Inland Empire Oil Refinery at Spokane, Washington, the Wasatch Oil Refining Company, and the Idaho Oil Refining Company, all of which he was largely instrumental in organizing.
In his growing-up years he was always active in the Church, and for ten years presided as the president of the Cottonwood Stake in Salt Lake County. Because of his vigorous leadership as a stake president in getting the Welfare Program of the Church under way in his stake, he was appointed in July 1936 by the First Presidency a member of the General Church Welfare Committee where he has since served as chairman, which position he holds at the present time.
So, at fifty-eight years of age, Henry D. Moyle brings into the councils of the General Authorities of the Church a strength of character, a vig-
experience and accomplishment that will be of inestimable worth to these councils. He is not unknown to the body of the Church, for during the past ten years he has visited many of the stakes of Zion as an able teacher and a fearless exponent of the principles of the Welfare Program.
But, as always with a man of such qualities and high attainments, there is another side less heralded or publicized. In the quiet of his beautiful home in Holladay, there are his most treasured possessions and accomplishments, his lovely wife and companions, Alberta Wright, whom he married in 1913, and his four daughters, Alice, Marie, Virgina, and Janet and his two sons Henry and Richard. You haven't seen the full beauty in this man's soul until you have seen him as I have, waking his baby Richard at midnight to fondle him or to tiptoe into the bedroom as we did the other night, together, to see his latest grandson whom he calls his little "Patootie." Father love was never more in evidence than when you see this man, with pardonable pride, listening to music played by one of his accomplished daughters, or counseling with his son "Hank" about his cow or chicken projects. With the love and inspiration of such a wife, and the loyalty and support of such a family, this father has had, in them, some of the essentials to high and worthwhile achievement.
After I was asked to prepare this article I searched some of his writings and written addresses to find a statement that would reveal the source of the characteristic driving qualities of his life. I think I found it in this quotation: "With faith in God, with faith in our own destiny, and with in-
