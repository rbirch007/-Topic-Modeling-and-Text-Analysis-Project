NOSTALGIA Merling Dennis Clyde My heart cries out in springtime when redbuds start to flame; When lily leaves, upthrusting, spring's recurrent hopes proclaim, My eager, homesick longing for the hills will be the same; When prescient April holds flower-ladened arms to May, And air so freshly fragrant soothes winter's doubts away, A thousand vagrant breezes will call my feet to stray. And when those hills of homeland, With dogwood blooms of white, Along the winding uptrail, appear in radiant light, A mist of tears will silver the beauty of the sight. NOTES AND NEWs. Judging from the Newspaper Notices of President Hay and wife, one would be inclined to think that a decided change in Many things Would be effected by their �00d but quiet example. President Hayes abstains from the use of GOOD NATURE. Good nature is the best feature in the finest face. Wit may Win admiration, judgment command respect, knowledge attention, beauty inflame the heart with love, but 800d nature has a Ore powerful effect; it adds a thousand attractions to the Charms of beauty, and gives an air of beneficence to the homeliest face. FROM BEAR RIVER CITY, IDAHO. We are doing our best to carry out Counsel in the Way of buying wheat. Ick, �Mary Hansen, Secretary ALFRED TENNYSON. It began a New era in English verse when Alfred came Caroling out of Lincolnshire And since he has devoted his life exclusively to his call. �Anon ASSOCIATIONS OF NATURE. Spring has come again With its buds and blossoms Speaking to the heart in hopeful promise, and revealing, as it were, truthful lessons of t he Infinite. The glad waters have burst their ice-bound fetters, and as they flow freely along, one fancies they babble of the prison life in which cold stern winter had enthralled them. The glorious sunshine regenerates everything which it rests upon. . . . The birds returning again from their southern tour are caroling sweet melodies, as if their anthems of praise were uttered for all animate creation. RUSTIC WARBLINGS Yet, children around him feel no neglect, The poor arc blest from his ample store, He treats the aged with great respect, He is good to his mother � what man does� Wamsusie SYMPATHIZE WITH CHILDREN: Do you want to learn how to make the children love you? Do you want the key that will unlock the innermost recesses of their nature? Then sympathize with them always. Never allow yourself to ridicule any of their little secrets. . . . Kites and knots are only the precursors of older thoughts and deeper trials, which the parents may one day plead to share. . . . Above all, do not be ashamed to let children know that you love them. Remember, they will be men and women some day, and the slightest word which may influence their future lives should become a thing of moment in our eyes. � Editorial Page 
Women�s Sphere Ramona W. Cannon M1 "RS. MARGARET MERRILL FISHER, a granddaughter of Bathslieba W. Smith, fourth General President of Relief Society, died recently. As a young girl, Mrs. Fisher raised silkworms, spun the silk thread, and created the designs for the lovely lace made by her own hands. She also compiled a history of the Utah volunteer expeditions concerning the men who< fought in the Civil War. This volume was officially recognized by the United States Government. MRS. EFFIE DIGGE FIOUTZ, an Indian of Blackfoot, Idaho, is striving to inspire young Indian women to keep alive the arts, manual skills, and exquisite designs (developed from the "shifting moods" of moon, stars, sun, and mountain
peaks) that are traditional among Indian tribes, but are now rapidly vanishing. Already, native basket weaving is a lost art. (As high a price as $10,000 has been paid for the exquisite baskets of the famous, now deceased, Daht-so-la-le.) Mrs. Houtz's own beautiful creations have been exhibited and sold at the Biltmore in Los Angeles and at Marshall Field's in Chicago. MISS MITTIE ARNOLD and Miss Margaret E. Thomas started an herb garden a few years ago, as a hobby. They now have one of the largest and most famous herb farms in the United States, at Greene, R. I. SUSAN B. ANTHONY (1820-1906) fought for equality between men and women as to wages, education, suffrage, and property rights. At the time, "women owned nothing, not even their own wedding presents," and "controlled nothing, not even their own children." One newspaper commented: "As is the yellow fever to the South, the grasshopper to t he plains, the diphtheria to our northern cities, so is Susan B. Anthony and her class to all true, pure, lovely women." Before her death, Miss Anthony was pelted with roses while driving through a street where, many years earlier, the missiles had been eggs. This year, observance of her birthday was provided by law in California, Colorado, and Minnesota. In the latter State an act was passed in the legislative session of 1941 establishing Susan B. Anthony Day, to be observed by appropriate recognition in public schools and by the display of our flag on public buildings and schools. MISS CORNELIA M. VAN ASCH VAN WIJCK, of Holland, is president of the world Y. W. C. A. Formerly a wealthy aristocrat, she endured the poverty and starvation common to the Dutch during the war. Her great effort now is to bring help to the children of Europe, who have had their minds and characters "warped and twisted by hatreds and deceptions." The Mother as a Teacher PERHAPS the most important role which a mother is called upon to play is that of a teacher of her children. From the time that a child is born, the mother teaches him both by precept and example. The teachings carry over into the remainder of his life, and in times of stress and temptation there should arise in the child's mind either the admonitory words of his mother or the remembrance of her as she advocated certain actions in support of eternal principles. The child uses as his first standard of a home the one in which he lives. If it is a home whose appearance is orderly, clean, and attractive, he will have a pattern whereby he will judge the homes of his playmates. If, on homes, his own will be revealed in his eyes in an unfavorable light. A mother should teach, by her homemaking, the type of home which is in harmony with prophet living as taught by the gospel and, by setting such a standard, a mother will teach her children to establish and maintain like homes. How often one hears the expression, "Well, what could you expect, that was the kind of home in which she was reared?" Many a young man has been advised, in choosing a wife, to notice the character and habits of the mother of the young lady whom he Page 324 admires, the better to judge the manner in which she has been reared. Important as ls the appearance of a home, however, there is also the spirit of the home with which a mother must concern herself and which she largely builds. 'There may out, in each in which the dispute might have been settled amicably. Habits of industry and thrift will be inculcated in children if taught by the insistence and example of the e mother who idles away her time at home and spends these habits reflected in her children to give even less. There is a great and grave responsibility resting upon parents to "reach their children to walk up rightly before the mother's part of this responsibility VOL. 34 MAY 1947 
Here is the exact OCR transcription of the text:
is one for which she will be held strictly accountable, and one which she cannot, in righteousness, shift to the shoulders of another.
It would be impossible to measure the effort which a mother puts into the teaching of her children; it would likewise be impossible to measure the joy which comes to a mother through seeing her teachings reflected in the righteous and outstanding lives of her children. The proper teaching of her children is the foremost duty of any mother and nothing should be allowed to interfere, hamper, nor impair such teaching to the detriment of the eternal welfare of her children.
