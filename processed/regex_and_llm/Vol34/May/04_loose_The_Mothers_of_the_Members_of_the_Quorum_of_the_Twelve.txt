The Mothers of the Members of the Quorum of the Twelve Camilla E. Kimball OOKSHELVES all over the B world are crowded with biographies of men who have achieved success. Scan such lives closely, and behind each you will find a woman's silent inspiration. Usually, the mother has trained her son in boyhood to bear his part in the world's work. "For behold, this is my work and my glory�to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). With this truth in mind, could anything bring greater joy and satisfaction to a true mother than to have her son chosen as a special witness for Jesus Christ, to devote his life to the accomplishment of this lofty purpose? How proud and happy must be the mothers of the present-day apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, most of whom look at their sons' accomplishments from the vantage point of eternity, but some few of whom are here to share the honor which comes to them through their sons' accomplishments. The short stories of the lives of these mothers which follow, are told, in most part, by the sons themselves. Nanny Longstroth Richards� Mother of Elder George F. Richards - Nanny Longstroth Richards was born in Clitheroe, Lancaster, England, April 15, 1828. Her father's name was Stephen Longstroth and her mother's name was Ann Gill Longstroth. Her parents were among the first in England to receive the gospel. With them she came to America when she was about twelve years of age. They came by way of New Orleans and up the Mississippi River, stopping off at St. Louis, Missouri, for a season while her father, who by trade was a cabinetmaker, earned enough money to pay their way by boat to Nauvoo. She met and married Willard Richards, who was the private secretary of the Prophet Joseph Smith, an apostle of the Church, and later a counselor to Brigham Young in the Presidency of the Church. He was with the Prophet and Patriarch at their, martyrdom in Carthage Jail, June 27, 1844. Nanny had two daughters and a son by Willard Richards, and after his death she married Willard's nephew, Franklin Dewey Richards, and by him had one daughter and two sons, one of whom, George F. Richards, is now the President of the Quorum of the Twelve. She was with the saints when they were being mobbed and driven from Nauvoo, and in their emigration to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. With them she endured the hardships of making the barren wastes into fruitful valleys and in making the "desert blossom as a rose." She was a modest, retiring person, Page  NANNY LONGSTROTH RICHARDS of great faith and integrity to the truth. One outstanding characteristic of her life was the exactness with which she observed the law of tithing. She died January 7, 1911, in Salt Lake City. �George F. Richards wm me Ke Kk OK Julina Lambson Smith�Mother of Elder Joseph Fielding Smith Julina Lambson Smith, the second daughter of Alfred B. And Melissa J. (Bigler) Lambson, pioneers of 1847, was born June 18, 1849 in the home of her parents, which was the first house plastered in Salt Lake City. She became the wife of Joseph F. Smith, sixth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, on May 5, 1866. She was chosen as the president of the 16th Ward Relief Society when eighteen years of age, and a member of the General Board of the Relief Society in 1892, when it became the National Woman's Relief Society. She was one of the first duly qualified midwives in the State, and exerted her widely sought skill for hundreds of patients. In 1881 her recJULINA LAMBSON SMITH EMMA STAYNER RICHARDS ord numbered 1025; this was years before she stopped the work. She would make daily calls for ten days for $s, if the people could afford to pay, and for nothing, if they could not. For her it was always a joy to place a tiny one for the first time in its mother's arms, for she felt again the thrill that she experienced when she looked into the face of one of her own children. She never lost a mother, and but one baby, a twin, because of conditions which were unavoidable. Unfailingly she knelt in prayer before she went to her patients. She was the mother of eleven children, four sons and seven daughters, and. She adopted two others. She was with her husband on a mission to the Hawaiian Islands, where she was an angel of mercy to the wives of missionaries and to many Hawaiian women. For many years she was an ordinance worker in the: Endowment House, and was set apart as one of the original workers in the Salt: Lake Temple where she' labored for a numbel of years, MOTHERS�MAKERS OF MEN A wonderful beloved and honored - mother and friend, Julina Lambson Smith lived to be eighty-six years old. Death came to her on January 10,  Emma Louise Stayner Richards� Mother of Elder Stephen L Richards My mother, Emma Louise Stayner Richards, was born in the little town of Farmington, sixteen miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah. Her parents were Mormon converts who had emigrated from England. She was the eldest child. Her mother died when she was a young girl, leaving to her a large responsibility in the care of her brothers and sisters and the maintenance of their home. She inherited a sincere love for education and its refining processes largely from her father, Arthur Stayner. He had, prior to his conversion to the hurch, been educated for the ministry in England. So thoroughly did my mother be lieve that education in Church and school would make for better and more efficient living that a large portion of her married life, and that of my father, as well, was filled with great sacrifice for the training of their children. She studied with us; she tewarded our efforts; and for nearly twenty-five years she never left her family alone for a single night. Remembering today her beautiful devotion, the encouragement she constantly gave for the attainment of the better things of life, and the stimulation of her noble example, | am filled with inexpressible gratitude and thanksgiving to God for such a mother, �Stephen L Richards wk ok ok 293 Anna Karine Gaarden Widtsoe� Mother of Elder John A. Widtsoe Anna Karine Gaarden Widtsoe was born June 4, 1849, in the smal] fishing village of Titran on the famous little Island of F Toya, the outermost island off the coast of Norway. He was individualistic from childhood, knew her own mind, and made her own decisions. She was impatient with traditional practices, which her superb self-reliance en. Abled her to ignore. She had a clear intelligence, coupled with sound judgment. She was always religious and prayerful, The self-willed girl sat up through long sun-ighted summer nights, reading and reading. Forever she hungered for more knowledge, more truth, more progress. En Anna was twenty-one and a half years old, she was married to John Andersen Widtsoe, the highly respected schoolmaster. To this happy union were born two sons, John and Osborne. When the baby Osborne was less than two months old, her husband died, and for Anna "the heavens and the earth had been swallowed up in darkness,..." Some years later two gospel tracts were placed in a pair of shoes which had been repaired, and there began the years of study which finally convinced her that Mormonism was from friends, she emigrated to Zion with a group of saints, settling in Logan. When stricken by her last illness, ANNA KARINE she said to her son John, "I want to tell you that the most glorious thing that came into my life was the message delivered to me by Shoemaker Johnsen of Trondhjeim. Please bear that witness for me to all who will listen." In the diary of her oldest son, on the date of Sister Widtsoe's funeral, occurs the following: She was a most devoted mother, loyal to the last degree. Her devotion to the cause of truth was almost sublime. She was self-sacrificing beyond expression, in behalf of her own, and those who needed help. Her mind was transparently clear. To her I owe my inspiration. Many thanks! Dear Mother. We Maria Loenza Kingsbury Merrill� Mother of Elder Joseph F. Merrill Maria L. Kingsbury, born in 1852 in Salt Lake City, was left motherless at the age of nine months. A kindly but childless couple named Lewis took her and a sister two years older into their home and reared them as their very own. This Lewis family was among the founders of Richmond, Cache Valley, in 1860, a town Maria called her home until MARIA LOENZA GAARDEN WIDTSOE KINGSBURY MERRILL ANNIE SHACKELTON BOWEN the day of her death. However, she had in the meantime lived brief periods in other places�two summers in railroad camps in Idaho and Montana, and three years with her son, Melvin, when he was a student at Chicago, Harvard, and Washington Universities. As a girl, she was favored with robust health and a friendly disposition. Growing up as a farmer's daughter in a small frontier town where school opportunities were crude and meager, her book education was very limited, but her training in hard work was abundant. All girls in her day and town naturally looked to the vocation of housewife and mother as a woman's proper sphere. She was popular with the boys, but when Marriner W. Merrill, twenty years her senior and the bishop of the ward, without any previous indication of his intentions, surprised her with an offer of marriage, she blushed, stammered, and ran away, only later to return and proudly accept. Everybody looked upon the bishop as the outstanding man of the town. An offer to come MOTHERS�MAKERS OF MEN into his family was an honor that no right-thinking girl would reject. So she became the bishop's fourth wife, and settled down in her own little house and gave herself. To the duties of a devoted wife and mother, believing with all her heart that children would be the brightest jewels in her celestial crown. She became the mother of ten children�Joseph the oldest and Lenora the youngest. Four boys and five girls grew to maturity, married in the Temple, and presented their mother with forty-nine grandchildren, twenty-seven boys and twenty-two girls. Maria, always a loving, devoted wife and mother, died in October 1925, at the age of seventy-three. Annie Shackelton Bowen� Mother of Elder Albert E. Bowen A thread of singular strength and beauty ran through the life of Annie Shackleton Bowen, mother of Elder Albert E. Bowen. It was her passion for the things that enrich and cultivate the mind. In remote pioneer settlements, far removed from libraries, she was herself a library, and from the treasure of her well-stored memory she created intellectual oases in an otherwise barren wilderness. Her knowledge of the finest things in English literature and history gained as a young girl in England was an inspiration to her children and a light in the community. She was more than a brave woman who walked almost every mile of the way from Omaha to Salt Lake, who fought crickets on an Idaho ranch, and who made all the clothes and knit all the stockings for a large family. She was also a woman who could sing and recite, who copied music for the choir, who taught her 295 children to read and spell during winter evenings at home, and who, when books were available, bought books, and though they might be only paper bound and poorly printed, they were always classics. Born in London on September 26, 1840, Annie' never had a day of formal schooling but could remember standing as a small child at her mother's side while she was at work, and spelling out words to her. Daily, she had to read a chapter aloud to her mother from the Bible before she could go out to play. Thus, at home and at the Baptist Sunday School, the delight of her child's heart, she came to an early knowledge and love of the Book of Books. At the age of ten she went to work at a stationer's and at fourteen she found employment at a millinery establishment. There, her associates would lend her books to take home at night on condition she would tell them the contents next day as they worked. In this way not only did she read, but she remembered what she read. She came to know all the writings of Dickens, Scott, Thackeray, Eliot, Macaulay, and knew much of England's great poetry and fascinating history. Annie had a good voice, and somehow had learned to read music. She managed to hear some of the operas and oratorios performed in her great London and carried a good deal of their music in her head. After the family joined the Church in 1851, Annie sang in the branch choir and sang for the elders at their meetings. Annie emigrated to Utah in 1860 and the following year married David Bowen, a convert from Wales. In 1869 the family moved to Henderson Creek in Southern Idaho to 296 LOUISA EMELINE BINGHAM LEE undertake a new life in farming. There were neither books nor schools in the new community; as her mother had taught her, so Annie now taught her children, (there were four, and at Henderson Creek three boys were born. Eventually the family would increase to ten children.) Her retentive memory served as textbook. Seven years later, when the family moved to Samaria, an M. I. A. Was organized, and Annie's memory served her again as she filled gaps in the lessons with remembered songs and poems. Her comic readings, lively singing, and spicy dialogues drew people to the gatherings from all over the valley. It was characteristic that with the proceeds from a bazaar she should buy books, twentyfive of them, for a young people's library. And it was characteristic that as she walked through the streets she should note the good voices among the children at play and form a dozen of them into a chorus for part singing. At her death in 1929 in Logan, at the advanced age of eighty-eight, it OLIVE WOOLLEY KIMBALL; DUNKLEY BENSON could be said of Annie Shackelton Bowen that her treasures of memory had been the branches that had run over the wall and blossomed in culture and refinement in. The deserts of the West. Ke Kk Louisa Emeline Bingham Lee� Mother of Elder Harold B. Lee My mother, Louisa Emeline Bingham Lee was born January 1, 1879 in Clifton, Idaho. She was the second of four children born to Perry Calvin Bingham and Rachel Elvira Henderson. As a young girl, she assumed much of the responsibility of caring for an invalid mother as well as performing many of the outside chores. Because of these early experiences she became resourceful, self-reliant, and inured to the hardships common to the pioneer rural life of that early day. My earliest recollections of her untiring labors, before we were old enough to help, was of her toiling in the fields with Father, mowing and raking the hay, and plowing and assisting in other farm work. Because of her skill as a seamstress, MOTHERS�MAKERS OF MEN her children were always considered well-dressed. Until we were almost ready to begin high school, much of our outer clothing was made over from secondhand cicthes. She is an outstanding practical nurse. That natural skill coupled with an unwavering faith has, on more than one occasion, stayed the hand of death in our home. A doctor was seldom in our home excepting when the babies came and then, usually, he made a tardy entrance. From her early girlhood Mother was active as a teacher in the Sunday School and the Y. W. M. IA. She presided as a ward president in the M.I.A. And as a counselor in the stake presidency of the same organization. She is deeply religious, intensely loyal to her friends, and vigorous in her resistance to those who would attack her children. While never upholding members of her family in their misdeeds, she unflinchingly defends them against slander. In my "growing-up" days she seemed possessed of a keen intuition of impending trouble or temptation, ahd more than once raised her voice in warning long before I became conscious of that danger. She has always been outspoken and has a manner of correcting �frors that proves quite effective. Even in my manhood days, I value greatly her wisdom, and in her I have a never-failing support that I feel certain will continue with me even though she should precede me in death. �Harold B. Lee we Ke OK Olive Woolley Kimball�Mother of Elder Spencer W. Kimball My mother was a saint. At least to 297 me she seemed to be through those eleven years she lived after I came into the world. Perhaps might have received the impression of her sainthood when the light would shine through her light red hair, and make a halo to frame her lovely fair face, blue eyes, and incomparable smile�and perhaps it was because I knew no weakness or even shortcomings in her life, for to my youthful understanding, she was the epitome of perfection. 'There were eleven children, and I am grateful that she did not, like so many modern mothers, decide that two or three were enough. I was the sixth. "Py" called her "Ollie," and we children used the old-fashioned appellation, "Ma." For most of her twenty-eight years of married life, she was what is often termed a "church widow," and never complaining, she kept the light in the window for her husband and the home fires burning for her children those many years while Father was '1 the Indian Territory Mission and president of the St. Joseph Stake. There was real sacrifice in leaving the comforts of a good, new home and the sophistication of Great Sait Lake City in the nineties, to go pioneering into Arizona in answer to the "call," but she helped burn bridges behind them, and start anew in a desert land, so recently taken from the Apaches. She entertained presidents and apostles, governors and statesmen, and won their eternal admiration and appreciation. And during those twenty-eight years, while bearing and rearing eleven children, she played the organ, sang, and presided in ward and stake organizations in Relief So- 298 ciety work. Many people came under the spell of her captivating personality and sweet dignity. I said my mother was faultless. She never spoke guile. When the group was inclined to analyze personalities with a degree of poison in their darts, my mother always came to the rescue with an enumeration of that person's virtues, which put the accusers to flight. Though I was young when she died, I well remember many things about her: the sulphur and molasses she gave us in the spring; my childhood prayers at her knee; the family prayers with her presiding in the frequent absence of "Pa"; the Saturday night bath in the galvanized tin bathtub, with her directing; the occasional and coveted trips with her in the buggy to the store at Layton, three miles away; her scrubbing of my neck and ears, much too often to suit me; and my sitting close to her in meeting; and, finally, that tragic day when we children were all called out of school to learn that "Ma" was gone. Her forty-six years, from her birth, June 1, 1860, till her death in October 1906, were full, rich, and abundant, and her eleven children and numerous descendants will eternally call her blessed. �Spencer W. Kimball eke Sarah Dunkley Benson� Mother of Elder Ezra Taft Benson Born of staunch Scotch-English parents, Sarah Dunkley first saw the light of day in the little pioneer village of Franklin, Idaho's oldest permanent white settlement, where her father had been sent by Brigham Young as one of the leaders of a pioneer band to establish the first colony in Northern Cache Valley. The parents, who joined the Church in the "old country," each one of a family, were soon pioneering on a forbidding alkali farm in what later became the Whitney Ward. Thirteen stalwart sons and daughters blessed this thrifty, sweetspirited home, of which Sarah was the oldest daughter, born June 29, 1878. Her sparkling dark eyes and abundant black hair added to her sweet and pleasing personality. Referred to as "a little mother," she was a leader among the younger set, where her sweet spirit and fervent testimony were ever an influence for good. While still in her teens, she had completed the work at the oneroom schoolhouse, the Oneida Stake Academy, and had organized and taught a summer school. Blessed with a lovely voice, she was in demand for solos, participated in choruses, and sang in the then popular ward choir which won first prize in a valley-wide contest and was led by Elise Benson Alder, later a member of the Relief Society General Board. Early in her young womanhood, Sarah became active in the auxiliaries as teacher and executive, and at seventeen had completed a special sewing course in Logan. Known for her beautiful sewing, she often served young and old in this capacity, and later made dresses, trousers, and shirts for her Jarge family until they were in college. Her marriage in the Logan Temple, October 19, 1898 to George Taft Benson, joined two prominent families of thirteen children each. A model homemaker, she moved with her husband into a simple two-room MOTHERS�MAKERS OF MEN house which had been planned, built, furnished, and decorated largely with their own hands. Here, eleven children, seven sons and four daughters, were born and reared, although Sarah's life was despaired of at the birth of her oldest son, Ezra Taft. While rearing her family, all of whom were fully active in the Church, she found time to serve as teacher, Relief Society president, stake Primary executive, choir member, and was in great demand by the sick and discouraged. � In 1912 her husband responded to a call for a mission to the Northern States, leaving her with seven children. The eighth child was born four months later. Half of the farm was sold to finance the mission and a part of the balance used to feed a dairy herd left in charge of the family. In spite of the load carried by this noble woman, it was often said, "Never at any time did we hear a murmur from her lips." Sarah Dunkley Benson lived a life which seemed without flaw, as wife, mother, and Latter-day Saint. From her sickbed, where she was suffering from an incurable ailment following an operation, but unknown to her children, she bade one of her youngest sons goodbye, as he left for the Southern States Mission, in these words: "No matter what happens at home, I want you to complete your mission." A few months later this heroic mother passed peacefully away. Almost a year to the day, her husband followed her. The charge "complete your mission," was fully honored, as her name is honored, by a numerous posterity from eleven families�her sons and daughters. 299 Christine Marie Andersen Petersen� Mother of Elder Mark E. Petersen Christine Marie Andersen Petersen was born near Aalborg, Denmark, November 1, 1872. At the age of sixteen years she became interested in the gospel and shortly afterward joined the Church. While still in her teens she emigrated to Utah in company with a group of Danish Saints and missionaries returning to their homes in the valleys of the mountains. She made her home with friends, members of the Church, in Salt Lake. Here she met Christian Petersen, whom she afterward married. In the Salt Lake Temple. She is a woman of sterling qualities, staunch and stalwart in her Church affiliation. She has taught her children to be so, and takes great pride in their accomplishments. She is modest and retiring. She is an immaculate housekeep- �r, an expert seamstress, and maintains order in her household. Throughout her life she has been an active member of the Church, serving in the Relief Society over a period of years, and having done temple work in the Salt Lake Temple. She and her husband, with their five children, celebrated their golden wedding anniversary three years ago, with a family gathering and dinner party at the Hotel Utah. * Oe OK Abbie Hyde Cowley� Mother of Elder Matthew Cowley Abbie Hyde Cowley was born January 19, 1863, at Hyde Park, Utah. She was the daughter of William Hyde and Abigail Gloyd; her father was a native of New York, as were his ancestors for some generations ABBIE HYDE COWLEY back. Abigail Gloyd, her mother, was also of that sturdy and industrious eastern stock who came to America in the early colonial days. Her ancestors, and also the ancestors of William Hyde, fought in the War of the Revolution for Ameri-can independence. Abbie Hyde was reared by goodly parents in a strong, spiritual environment. She took an active part in the auxiliary institutions of the Church and earned rewards of merit for her punctuality and diligence. She obtained her scholastic training at the common schools of Hyde Park, at the Brigham Young College at Logan, and at the Deseret University in Salt Lake City. Among her teachers were Dr. John R. Park, Joseph B. Kingsbury, and Joshua Paul. On May 21, 1884, the first day the Logan Temple was opened for endowments and marriages, she was sealed for time and eternity to Matthias Foss Cowley. President Daniel H. Wells performed the marriage ceremony. From this union were born eight children, five sons and three daughters. She was always a constant and faithful worker in the Relief Society and held positions of responsibility in the ward and stake in which she spent the greater part of her married life. She was affiliated with the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers and the Daughters of the Mormon Bat-talion and served as both regent and chaplain of the latter organization. She was a faithful and dutiful daughter, a loving and devoted wife, a mother of the highest type, full of love, care and devotion for her children. She taught them righteous principles by both precept and ex-ample. This noble woman and faithful saint passed from this life on the 25th day of August, 1931. Alice Dinwoodey Moyle� Mother oi Elder Henry D. Moyle Alice Dinwoodey was born in Salt Lake City, a daughter of Henry Dinwoodey, a pioneer furniture maker, and Sarah Kinnersley Dinwoodey. Her friends have continued to call her Alice Dinwoodey all through life. She is a confidant of all her children and has always been endowed with the ability to be in her thinking at least as young as her children. She was also able to influence the lives of her four boys and two daughters to a very marked degree. In the home she seemed more like one of the children than a parent. With her recitations and with her piano, she instilled in the hearts of her children a love for the finer things of life, especially good music and good literature. It was her interest in her children and her efforts to be one with them that helped her to lead her family into very happy marriages.
It was her early teachings that caused her sons to go on missions. It was her letters to these boys on missions that helped materially to sustain them in their work in the mission field and, when later in life, she went with her husband James H. Moyle to preside over the Eastern States Mission, it was little wonder that the won the love and affection of the young people who labored in the mission at that time.
An alumnus of the University of Utah herself, she took great pride in seeing all her children graduate from the same school and inspired most of her sons and daughters to continue their education, after graduating from the University of Utah, in schools of higher education. To this day she continues devoting herself to strengthening the faith of her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren.
