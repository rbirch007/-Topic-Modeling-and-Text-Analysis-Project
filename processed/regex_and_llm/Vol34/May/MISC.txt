THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 34, NO. 5 MAY 1947 A MOTHER BUILDED Christie Lund Coles They say she did not know her motherhood Had built so well the stature of her son, Who took his place among the great and good And shared with her the honor he had won. She merely strove and toiled the endless day, And watched and prayed throughout the darkest night; She sent her boy with blessing to his play, And marked each task to see that it was right. She kept her faith, held it tenaciously, She led the way and always was the one To help him, and to strive religiously To see that nothing good was left undone. "The way the twig was bent," they say, "it grew." She builded wisely. In her heart, she knew! The Cover: 'Pioneer Mother," Photograph by Willard Luce The cabin is in Sowiette Park, Provo, Utah. Mrs. Loleta Dixon is the mother and the baby is Lynda McEwan. Photograph by Grace T. Kirton "JEWEL IN A UTAH STAT FLO E RAL SETTING" CAPITOL Se, Mothers�Makers of Men
