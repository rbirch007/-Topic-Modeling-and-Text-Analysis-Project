Notes From the Field" appear in the Magazine for October 1946, page 685. SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GENERAL ACTIVITIES AUSTRALIAN MISSION, MELBOURNE BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY OFFICERS Left to right: Counselor Elsie Kneale; President Edna Ord; Counselor Betty Hodgson. Florence T. Rees, former president, Australian Mission Relief Society, reports that Sister Bartlett was released from her duties as president of the Melbourne Branch Relief Society after serving six years and carrying out a very successful Church Welfare Program. The new presidency are the youngest executives in the mission. Sister Ord and Sister Kneale have acted as part-time missionaries for four years. Sister Hodgson, a university graduate, has been the social science class leader. Sister Rees reports, also, some of the interesting customs of the Australians and the arts and crafts of the country: '"'While quiltmaking is a national art of the American women, I would say knitting is Australia's art. Baby layettes (consisting of vest, slip, dress, jacket, coat, cap, bootees, and shawl) are knitted from beautifully white, soft yarn. They are most attractive. The patterns are varied and are made in exquisite lacy designs. Not only a few, but all babies in Australia are fortunate enough to possess several of these layettes. Knitting is taught in the grade schools. The women knit in the streetcars or in the trains on their way to work. They knit in the theatres, and they use all the free moments they have for knitting. Australia has the best yarn in the world. The climate is similar to that of California. There is no central heating plant in most of the homes. The lovely knitted woolens serve to keep the babies comfortably warm. I would say that Australian babies are beautifully dressed and well nourished."

One song was rendered by the Riverdale Ward Singing Mothers and two numbers by the stake Singing Mothers. The benediction was given by Sister Nettie T. Christensen, who had been a member of one of the earlier boards, but had moved away from the stake. She is the mother of Harold T.

MAKING PROJECT For several years quiltmaking has been an important and popular work meeting project in Park Stake. Among the many faithful workers who have contributed towards Emily La Fonte, eighty-six years old. She has bound over two hundred quilts for the Society and her work is exquisitely neat and beautiful. Sister La Fonte's support of all Relief Society activities Is outstanding and she is very much loved and appreciated by all the members of her ward, EMILY LA FONTE  Elder Henry D. Moyle (Continued from page 303) dividual effort expended�nothing is impossible." In a just cause which most men have thought hopeless and have quit fighting, Henry D. Moyle has just begun the fight. A man with such fighting qualities is certain to have made some people disaffected toward him, but his friends, the friends of righteousness, are legion and, as the Church members come to know him better, they will know him as an able preacher of righteousness, a fearless defender of the faith, and a loyal and powerful advocate of the truth. Such is, in part, the man Henry D. Moyle, whom the Council of the Twelve unanimously accepts into their quorum, and the Church welcomes as one of its leaders should always be the result when energy is expended. Yet, like a dizzily spinning top. Many businesses go 'round in the preparation of advertising and get nowhere. Month after month, the same thing happens again and again and nothing is accomplished by the expenditure of dollars that could be made to produce results. The function of a printing organization today is to help clients to plan printing that builds sales�to take copy and dramatize it, make it so irresistibly attractive that it must naturally draw the reader's attention.
