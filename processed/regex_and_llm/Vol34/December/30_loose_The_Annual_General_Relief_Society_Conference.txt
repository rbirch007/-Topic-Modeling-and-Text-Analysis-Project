the Annual General Relief Society Conference, in the Tabernacle, October 2, 1947.] N the Book of Psalms we are told: "... The righteous shall be held in everlasting remembrance." The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us to hold in sacred remembrance the righteous who have gone before us, to search out their good works, and to venerate their names. This Centennial year has been a good year, adapted to this useful end. Through the activities of this year, we have become more familiar with the personalities that have established the Kingdom of God in this dispensation and built this great commonwealth. We have been made to more fully appreciate the qualities that make a people strong and the values that endure. We have seen that great achievements do not come through walking the easy, comfortable road, but that vision, faith, diligence, and sacrifice, though grappling with the severest type of disappointment, discouragement, physical suffering, and disheartening conditions, can triumph gloriously, and make possible the erection of a mighty structure that will win admiration and perpetuate in loving remembrance the names of those who built. We know that it has not been by the wisdom and works of man alone that our people have attained their present favored position in the Intermountain West and in the world. We know that the wisdom of him who is above man, whose knowledge is greater than man's, and whose power is above the power of man, has directed the saints in their course, through his inspired servants. The womanhood of the Church has shared in the blessings of the Lord and has been a recipient and beneficiary of his inspired guidance. In building this commonwealth and establishing the Kingdom of God, the women of Mormondom have stood side by side with the men of the Church, accepting the responsibilities as well as the joys. In the face of unspeakable persecution and hardship, the pioneer women did not flinch. They met the required sacrifices with a courage born of sublime faith. N the work of religious empire founding, the women had no thought of making history; yet they played a stirring role. They trained nurses, established a hospital, engaged in industry; they did their part in the erection of temples, tabernacles, and meetinghouses; they gathered grain, from which activity we today enjoy a sense of security; they were active in the National Suffrage Movement; they worked earnestly in the interest of statehood for Utah and rejoiced when this was granted on January 4, 1896. Page 795 Mormon women have been honored with political office, both elective and appointive, and have been able, effective public servants. Irrespective of their civic activities, Latter-day Saint women have been devoted mothers and homemakers. "While bearing children
and caring for their households, they
have carried forward the work of the
women's auxiliaries of the Church.
They have supported the missionary
program. They have done vicarious
work for the dead in the temples of
the Church, and they have rendered
countless hours of compassionate
service to the living. They have given
untiringly to the building of the
Kingdom of God, responding unselfishly
to t he many and diversified
calls of the Church. This they have
done because of their firm conviction
of t he truth of the restored gospeEll.
i za R. Snow beautifully reveals
the spirit of these Mormon women
and the influence that motivated
their lives in lines from one of her
poems, as follows:
My heart is fixed � I know in whom I trust.
Twas not for wealth � 'Twas not to gather
perishable things . . .
That I forsook the home of childhood;
that I left the lap of ease �
Oh, no! A holier purpose fill'd my soul;
A nobler object prompted my pursuit.
Eternal prospects opened to my view,
And hope celestial in my bosom glowed . . .
The proclamation sounded in my ear �
It reached my heart � I listened to the
sound �
Counted the cost, and laid my earthly all
Upon the altar, and with purpose fixed
Embrac'd the everlasting covenant,
And am determined now to be a saint,
And numbered with the tried and faithful
ones,
Whose race is measured with their life;
whose prize
Is everlasting, and whose happiness
Is God's approval; and to whom 'tis more
Than meat and drink to do His righteous
will.
The women of the past built great
because of the strength of their testimonies;
they b uilt great because
they dreamed great, because they
had faith in their cause, because they
loved the organization which had
been given by a prophet of God
through which they might work, because
they placed the welfare of the
whole above that of the individual,
because they humbly accepted the
decisions of the Church Authorities
with faith as being in their best interests,
because they were righteous
women whom the Lord blessed.
'THDDAY, at the beginning of a new
century, we stand humbled by
all that the women of the past have
accomplished and by all they have
done for us. They have passed on
to us a great heritage and a strong
organization through which we, too,
may express ourselves, and consummate
praiseworthy achievements.
They have passed on to us, too, their
unfulfilled dreams and desires with
which we must keep faith.
Two years ago at our Relief Society
general conference, there was
brought to your attention a deepseated
and sincere desire that had
persisted in the hearts and minds of
Relief Society women year after year
as the century rolled by� the desire
for a Relief Society building, one
that would beautifully and adequately
represent the women of the
Church, one that should be a symbol
to all people of the lofty position accorded
faithful daughters of our
Heavenly Father in the gospel plan.
We told of our earnest desire to bring to fruition this long-cherished
dream. We told you of the continuing
growth of the Society, with the
continuous expansion of the various
departments conducted by the General
Board to serve the Society and
the Church, and which demanded
that provision soon be made to more
adequately house the general offices,
the Temple-Burial Clothes
Department, the Magazine, the
Welfare, and other departments.
Just as our sisters of long ago had
called for a vote on this identical
proposition forty-nine years before,
we called for a vote of the great congregation
of R elief Society sisters
assembled in the Tabernacle, representing
most of the stakes and missions
of t he Church. It was proposed
that a Relief Society building be
erected that would be monumental
and beautiful and adequate to serve
the Society not only for the present
but for years to come. One of the
most stirring experiences of my life
came when, like one great wave,
thousands of uplifted hands unanimously
voted in the affirmative.
At that meeting, President Smith,
addressing the sisters, endorsed the
building program as follows:
If you are going to have a house large
enough to hold yourselves from now on,
you may as well plan to build it. I am delighted
to k now that you are thinking of
erecting such a structure. Don't you think
it would be appropriate for you women
of the Church of Jesus Christ, the only
Church that bears his name by divine
authority, to have a home of your own into
which you could invite the spirit of the
Lord when you hold your meetings? I
realize you have been disappointed in the
past; you thought you had a house once
before, but it turned out to be the Presiding
Bishop's offices also. But now
your prospect seems to be better, and as
you think about it and plan for it, you
will be very happy. I don't care how fine
it is, how large it is, or how beautiful it
is; it will not be better than you deserve.
There isn't anything too good for you as
long as you keep the commandments of
the Lord. You know he said, "Seek ye
first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
and all these things shall be addIte
d w uinltlo yboeu . a" gratifying experience for the
daughters of Zion to feel that they have
been able to provide themselves a suitable
home, and that day is not far away.
We have now been authorized by
the First Presidency to present for
your sustaining vote a plan which
has the approval of the First Presidency
for financing the erection of
the proposed building. The letter
from the First Presidency reads as
follows:
September 16, 1947
President Belle S. Spafford
and Counselors
Relief Society
Dear Sisters:
We acknowledge your letter of August
25, in which you ask permission to have
Sister Spafford announce the financial
plan, as approved, for a new Relief Society
building, setting out the details of
a fund-raising campaign of one year, the
campaign to end at the Relief Society
General Conference in 1948.
We are happy by this letter to give to
you this authority and we wish for you a
most successful campaign. We have never
known the sisters to fail in anything they
have undertaken in the past and we feel
sure they will not fail in this.
Praying the Lord to be with you and
with your Board and with all the Relief
Society organizations of the Church and
their officers in their great work, which
was outlined for them by the Prophet Joseph
himself, and which over the years
they have carried on with such marked
success, we are
Faithfully yours,
George Albert Smith

The First Presidency
 PLAN FOR FINANCING A RELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING 797 HE General Board therefore proposes that a fund-raising program for the erection of a Relief Society building be conducted as follows: 1. That it commence as of this day, October 2, 1947, and close with the Relief Society general conference in October 1948, a period of one year. 2. That each local organization within the respective stakes be made responsible for submitting to the stakes for transmittal to the General Board a sum of money equal to $5 for each member enrolled as of December 31, 1946; this amount to be raised, insofar as possible, by $5 donations from each individual member, with any deficit to be made up from accrued earnings of the Society or from conducting special fundraising programs, such a bazaars, dinners, concerts, or other activities. 3. That each stake contribute one half of the total amount of its cash on hand in stake board funds as reported in the 1946 annual report. 4. That each stake board be responsible for seeing that the full amount assigned to the stake board and to the wards within the stake be turned over to the General Board. 5. That contributions which have already been made by wards, stakes, or mission branches be credited in accordance with this plan. That where such wards or stakes have since been divided, credit be taken for the contribution according to the division of Relief Society members. 6. That missions, other than those in Europe, participate in the fundraising program in accordance with the advice and judgment of the respective mission presidents. 7. That, in addition to contributions given by Relief Society members, as already specified, additional money needed to finance the building be obtained from memorial or other special gifts. 8. That the names of all contributors be recorded by the Society accepting the contribution, and that the record be filed with the permanent records of the Society; that duplicate copies of names of contributors be given the General Board in order that a complete record may be inscribed by the General Board to be placed in the cornerstone of the building. All in favor of this financial proposition signify it by the uplifted hand. [The proposed plan was adopted. ] Detailed plans will be mailed at an early date, but we call upon you sisters to begin at once on this program.. You will be pleased to know that in addition to the money raised by the Relief Society, the Church has promised to help us. On the easel is the first drawing of the proposed building�beautiful, substantial, classic in design, with due allowance for expansion as the future needs of the Society demand. No site has as yet been chosen for the building. We hope that one will be granted us wherefrom we may look out upon the temple. O obtain the funds for the erection of this building is the first step in a big and wonderful undertaking for the present-day women of the Church. It is one requiring the devoted support of every Relief Society member. Nothing must be allowed to deter us nor tum us aside 798 RELIEF SOCIETY. MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1947 PLAN FOR FINANCING A RELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING from the great goal which we have this day set for ourselves. It has been considered wise to work intensively for one year in raising the fund, even at the cost of our Relief Society setting aside other projected fund-raising programs. Every effort must be bent toward the accomplishment of this one great undertaking. The First Presidency has expressed its faith in the women of the Church. We must not fail. With success will come to us the satisfaction of an important task well done. We will all know the joy of having participated in a great project that will not only meet an urgent present-day need, but will stand as a monument to Latter-day Saint womanhood throughout the coming years. We will have the peace of mind of having kept faith with those noble women of the past�your mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers�by bringing their 799 dreams to fruition. We will have the assurance that we are passing on to women of the future a magnificent symbol of our faith, diligence, and devotion. We will have the pleasure of coming to this building, free to enjoy its service and beauty. It is my firm conviction that God is mindful of our great Relief Society and that he blesses Relief Society women in their righteous endeavors. He is mindful of his people everywhere, and he rewards them according to their faithfulness and diligence in observing the laws of righteousness and truth. May he bless you during the coming year that your testimonies may be strong. May he bless you individually, may he bless you in your homes and in all of your righteous undertakings. May the spirit of this conference continue with you to encourage, and sustain you is my sincere prayer. CHRISTMAS EVE Mary J. Morris The sand has slowly and without a sound Dissolved the year. I never know it's gone Until I see the presents heaped around The Christmas tree. Again, I hear a song I've known and loved since I, too, was a child And stood beneath the star-dressed sky To sing the holy hymn. Although self-styled In grown-up ways, my happy heart is shy And awed of such a light as shines tonight. Inside the house the air has warm, spiced wings, And holly berries catch the candlelight That keeps within this room�the King of Kings. This night is his; and candles cast a glow On childish silhouettes against the snow. THE INPORTANCE OF THE �FAMILY HOUR� Elder Ezra Tatt Benson Member, Member, Council of the Twelve [Excerpts from an address delivered at the first session of the 118 Semi-Annual General Conference, October 3, 1947]. THE desire for home and family is a strong and natural impulse ....The family is a divine institution established by our Heavenly Father. It is basic to civilization and particularly to Christian civilization. The establishment of a home is not only a privilege, but marriage and the bearing, rearing, and proper training of children are duties of the highest order .... This is a serious obligation. Down through the years the First Presidency of the Church and other leaders have counseled us and have admonished regarding the sacred obligation of parenthood and the teaching of children in the home. It was during the ministry of President Joseph F. Smith that a new project was organized and announced in the Church, and a letter directed to presidents of stakes, bishops of wards, and parents in Zion, from which I quote the following: We advise and urge the inauguration of a "Home Evening" throughout the Church, at which time fathers and mothers may gather their boys and girls about them in the home and teach them the word of the Lord. . . .Subsequently, President Heber J. G rant reaffirmed the instructions previously given and officially endorsed the holding of a family hour in the home as an effective means through which the gospel might be taught to our children and the bonds of love and affection strengthened between parents and children ....During the past few months, the Council of the Twelve, under the direction of the First Presidency, have given further  consideration to the powerful influences which tend to destroy the home and weaken the relationship between parents and children. As a result, a letter has been directed by President George F. Richards to presidents of stakes and bishops of wards recommending a revival and further motivation of this project inaugurated under the leadership of President Joseph F. Smith many years ago. The Council has called to its aid the Presiding Bishopric, heads of the Church auxiliaries, and, of course, the local Priesthood in the stakes and the wards. A major responsibility has been delegated to the Relief Society, and through this great organization of women, mothers in Israel� those who play such an important part in the training of our children� has been given the responsibility of the preparation of certain materials, as helps to parents. This material will be carried into the homes by the Relief Society teachers and the ward teachers ....
