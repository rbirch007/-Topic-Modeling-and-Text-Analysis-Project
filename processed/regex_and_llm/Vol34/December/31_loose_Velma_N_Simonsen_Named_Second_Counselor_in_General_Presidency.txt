Velma N. Simonsen Named Second Counselor in General Presidency of Relief Society President Belle S. Spafford ON October 2, 1947, Sister Velma Nebeker Simonsen was named second counselor in the General Presidency of Relief Society to succeed Sister Gertrude R. Garff whose resignation was made necessary because of increased home responsibilities. Sister Simonsen is well known to Relief Society women, having served as a member of the General Board since April 1945, during which time she has visited many of the stakes of the Church where she has conducted Relief Society conventions and where her capabilities and friendly personality have won her a host of friends. In addition to conducting Relief Society stake conventions, Sister Simonsen has filled many special assignments as a member of the General Board and has served as chairman of a number of standing committees. Her work as chairman of the work meeting committee has been particularly successful as is evidenced by the great interest shown in the activities of this day and in the increased number of women participating in the sewing program. VELMA N. SIMONSEN Throughout her lifetime, Sister Simonsen has been active in Church work, serving all of the auxiliaries at various times. She has filled two missions in the Northwest, teaching for two years the Indian mission school in Montana. She has had wide experience in both ward and stake Relief Society work. At the time of her appointment to the General Board she was president of the Yale Ward Relief Society. Her experience in ward and stake Relief Society work has given her an unusually fine understanding of the program of the Society and a deep appreciation for the workers who carry it forward. Her love for Relief Society and for the sisters who comprise its membership is constant and sincere. Page 801 She is faithful to duty and an energetic and indefatigable worker. She is possessed of many capabilities which, coupled with her great enthusiasm and friendliness, inspire in those with whom she works a confidence in her leadership, a desire to further the program which she espouses, and a love for her as an individual. In filling a position such as that to which Sister Simonsen has been called, the full support of husband and family is of great importance. This she enjoys to a marked degree. Ter husband, John O. Simonsen, is a member of the Bonneville Stake High Council. Brother and Sister Simonsen have four children, Winona, John M., now a missionary in the East Central States Mission, Robert, and Richard. In her new position as counselor in the General Presidency, Sister Simonsen will be assigned, in addition to her regular duties as counselor, the general supervision of the Temple-Burial Clothes Department of the General Board and the Mormon Handicraft Shop, positions she is well qualified to hold through aptitude, interest, and experience. In her new and important assignment, Sister Simonsen enjoys the full confidence of her fellow members of the General Board. It is our prayer that in this position, her firm testimony of the gospel, her capabilities, and her lovable spirit will further reach out to the sisters of Relief Society to influence and bless them, and that she will enjoy and find great satisfaction in her new opportunities for service to her Church through Relief Society. WINTER DELIGHT Grace M. Candland The snow has fallen turbulently all night, The scars of yesterday in field and town Are hidden in a coverlet of down, Agleam in morning light. Today I catch a falling flake to see The fragile beauty of its every part And marvel how some strange and magic art Perfects its symmetry. Each has its own design, distinct and true, And comes to earth intact in shape and form, Despite the whirling friction of the storm And irate winds that blew. Combined, they have a power none can guess; Their frozen vaporlets are held at bay For mountain freshets on a summer day In silent loveliness.
