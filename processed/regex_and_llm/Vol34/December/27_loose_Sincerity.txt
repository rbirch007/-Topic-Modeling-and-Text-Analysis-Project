TO HIM AGAIN Dorothy J. Roberts Let us hear the story told Afresh each Christmas time, Repeating all the stirring words� The inn, the Babe, the chime; The shepherds hearing through the night The glad hosanna song, The Magi bringing frankincense, And Mary, waiting long; Judea, domed and turreted, And humble Bethlehem� The words that light the star anew Illuminating them: "For unto you is born this night A Savior, Christ your King..." Till through the long-loved syllables We hear the angels sing. And lay the holy scene once more Within the heart's domain Where thoughts, like camels with their myrrh, Make trails to him again. The Cover: 'Madonna With the Child Jesus," from a painting by Dolci (1616- 1686). Arrangement by Evan Jensen.
