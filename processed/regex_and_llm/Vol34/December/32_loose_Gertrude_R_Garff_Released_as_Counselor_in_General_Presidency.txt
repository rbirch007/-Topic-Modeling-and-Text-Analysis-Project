Gertrude R. Garff Released as Counselor in General Presidency President Belle S. Spafford T the officers meeting of the general Relief Society conference held Thursday morning, October 2, 1947, the announcement of the release of Sister Gertrude R. Garff as second counselor in the General Presidency of Relief Society, and as a member of the General Board, was announced by President Belle S. Spafford. 'This action was made necessary because of Sister Garff's heavy home responsibilities. In tendering her resignation, Sister Garff stated, "The additional care of my six months' old baby is very time-consuming, and I find that my older children are in greater need of my personal attention to their problems now than they have ever been before. My home responsibilities are becoming ever greater from day to day." Sister Gartff was named a member of the General Board of Relief Society in January 1940 at the time Sister Amy Brown Lyman as called to preside as General President of the Society. In April 1945 she was called to serve as counselor to Sister Belle S. Spafford in the General Presidency. Since her appointment to this position, Sister Garff, in addition to her general duties as counselor, has had general supervision of the Temple-Burial Clothes Department of the General Board and also of the Mormon Handicraft Shop. She served as chairman of the October general conference committee for 1945 and GERTRUDE R. GARFF 1947 and as chairman of the stake convention committee for 1946. She has also served continuously as a member of the General Church Welfare clothing committee. Sister Garff's strong testimony of the gospel, her training, experience, and charm of personality admirably fitted her for the work which has been hers as a member of the General Board and as counselor in the Presidency, and her contribution to the work of the Society is deeply appreciated. Her good judgment has made her a wise and valued counselor. She has endeared herself to her associates, and it is with a sincere sense of regret that the members of the General Board part with her as one of their number. Page 803 The Annual General Relief Society Conference Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer October 2 and 3, 1947 HE annual general Relief Society Conference for 1947 was held Wednesday and Thursday, October 1 and 2, at Salt Lake City, Utah, with President Belle S. Spafford presiding. There were three sessions for officers, two on Wednesday and one on Thursday morning, in the Assembly Hall. The general session was held in the Tabernacle on 'Thursday afternoon. A Singing Mothers Centennial Concert, Relief Society's official contribution to the Utah State Centennial celebration, was held in the Tabernacle, Wednesday at 8:15 p. M. A chorus of more than 500 singers, from the following stakes, participated in the program under the direction of Sister Florence Jepperson Madsen of the General Board: Ben Lomond, Big Cottonwood, Bonneville, Cottonwood, Davis, East Jordan, East Mill Creek, East Provo, Emigration, Ensign, Farr West, Granite, Grant, Grantsville, Highland, Hillside, Lake View, Liberty, Mt. Jordan, Mt. Ogden, North Davis, North Jordan, North Weber, Ogden, Oquirth, Park, Pioneer, Provo, Riverside, Salt Lake, South Davis, South Ogden, South Salt Lake, Sugar House, Temple View, Tooele, Utah, Weber, West Jordan, and West Utah. Brother Frank W. Asper accompanied the Page 804 Singing Mothers at the organ and rendered two organ solos. Sister Arta Ballif was narrator of the script written by Sister Vesta P. Crawford. Sister Katherine Hess Peterson played a violin solo. A reception for stake and mission officers and invited guests was held Thursday, October 2, in the Lafayette Ballroom of the Hotel Utah from eight to ten P. M. The attendance at the conference was the largest at any Relief Society conference held to date, the officers meetings completely filling the Assembly Hall. President George Albert Smith attended the first session of the conference and gave the workers his blessing. The general session, which filled the Tabernacle, was especially significant. President David O. McKay paid tribute to the women of the Church, past and present. At this session President Spafford, upon authorization from the First Presidency, presented the plan for financing a Relief Society building, the erection of which was unanimously approved at the general Relief Society conference in October 1945. The fundraising plan, as adopted, commenced October 2. During President Spafford's talk the first color drawing of the building was placed upon an easel at the pulpit where all could see it. THE ANNUAL GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE At the officers meeting Thursday morning, President Spafford announced the resignation of Sister Gertrude R. Garff, Second Counselor in the General Presidency, due to increased home responsibilities with the coming of her fourth child, and the appointment of Sister Velma N. Simonsen, a member of the Board since April 1945, as the new second counselor. Both made brief talks, expressing their love for Relief Society work. Elder Marion G. Romney, Assistant Managing Director of the Church Welfare Committee, addressed this session on "The Joys of Welfare Service," which was published in the November issue of TheThe Presiding Bishopric and President Antoine R. Ivins of the First Council of Seventy were present at the general session Thursday, and members of the Church Welfare Committee and representatives of the auxiliary organizations attended the various sessions. SPECIALLY featured at the officers meeting were the demonstrations of a theology class lesson; a visiting teachers meeting; a fashion show, in which representatives from ten stakes modeled clothing made by Relief Society members; a social science department demonstration entitled "We Found the Way," emphasized the need for proper family training. At the afternoon session Wednesday, Sister Vesta P. Crawford, new associate editor of the Magazine, was introduced, and in 805 recognition of the diamond jubilee of the Latter-day Saint woman's publication, a commemorative skit was presented in which the six women who have served as past editors were impersonated and honored. A separate departmental meeting for secretaries was held in Barratt Hall. The music for the conference was unusually beautiful. At the Assembly Hall, Sister Beulah Huish Sadleir sang a lovely solo, and Lily M. Priestley, at the organ, played beautiful and appropriate prelude and postlude selections. At the general session in the Tabernacle, a chorus of Singing Mothers from the twenty-nine stakes in the Salt Lake and Jordan Valley regions and from the Provo, East Provo, Utah, and West Utah Stakes furnished the music. For the first two sessions of the general Church conference the following day, October 3, a Singing Mothers chorus from the Alpine, Kolob, Lehi, Nebo, Orem, Palmyra, Sharon, and Timpanogos Stakes furnished the music. Thus a total of more than one thousand Singing Mothers, under the direction of Sister Madsen, made a notable artistic and spiritual contribution to the Relief Society and general Church conferences. All the stakes of the Church and nine missions were represented at the conference. The mission presidents of Relief Society in Continental United States did not attend | the conference this year, due to unusually heavy responsibilities in their respective fields. ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS A Perry Picture From a Painting by Bouguereau, 1825-1905 IMMORTAL SONG Sadie Ollorton Clark Once, in a world of doubt and feat, The shepherds heard an anthem clear, A wondrous song of hope and cheer, On Christmas day. Until then few men would maintain That peace on earth could long remain, Or myriads sing that sweet refrain, On Christmas day. Since then a special spirit strives To keep the stars in children's eyes, This Gift of love immortalize, On Christmas day. And who can say that all is wrong, That hope is lost, and love is gone, If we still sing that holy song On Christmas day? CHRISTMAS PRAYER Christie Lund Coles This is my prayer for Christmas, Lord, Let every soul accept your word; Let every heart forget its fears, Keep trust in thee as Christmas nears. Let every night be one of stats, Let peace wipe out the stain of wars; Let all men kneel to Jesus' birth, Let his pure spirit rule the earth. Page 807 Christmas by Emergency Alice Morrey Bailey MY Crandall looked around at her family with dissatisfaction. Her husband, Jim, was passively reading the evening paper. Francine was painting her nails, and Paul was idly thumbing through the Christmas cards. There was an air of complete boredom on their faces, no enthusiasm whatever, though Christmas was the day after tomorrow. Her own mind was a hodgepodge of petty worries. Aloud she said, "I can't get Rita and those children off my mind." "Oh, Mother!" groaned Francine. "Do you have to spoil Christmas?" "Christmas!" said Paul contemptuously, "who knows anything about Christmas around this joint?" "T thought you were going to bring a tree home, Paul," said Amy. She had said the same thing every evening for two weeks. "Why do we have to have a tree?" "Because everybody on the block has one, silly," answered Francine. "Our house looks funny without one." "That's a swell reason," said Paul sarcastically. "Personally, I could sleep the day in and skip it. If anyone's determined to give me a present, let it be in the form of a check, seeing that I'm between jobs right now, and the payment on my car is due." "That goes for me, too," Francine said. "Expecting me to work on Christmas! I was never so mad!" Francine had quit her job at the telephone office last night. "A commercial racket!" exploded Page 808 Jim. "That's all Christmas is, any more." "Well, I never!" said Amy, feeling injured. "I'm sure I've done my best. I've cleaned every room in the house and sent cards to all our friends, shopped for gifts all round. I haven't left out a soul." "That should do it, Mom," said Paul. "Christmas all printed out on a card with a rhyme to match: Let Christmas live in your hearts so sweet A Merry Christmas is here, Tweet! Tweet!" He pushed the cards aside with disgust. "Children! Respect your mother!" Jim reprimanded, and there was a little, resentful silence. "T wonder if Rita has a tree?" asked Amy, and Francine heaved a long-suffering sigh. "Here we go again," she said. "Francine!" warned Jim. "Well, it's all mother's talked about since she saw them in church. I should think Rita'd have more pride than to bring her children into public dirty like that, and flaunt her poverty." "I'm not sure it's poverty," said Amy. "I've heard that the boy Rita married made a comfortable living. It seems deeper than that. I've lost track of Rita since her mother died last March." CHRISTMAS BY EMERGENCY "Then it must be a plain case of laziness. I never saw such unkempt children. Whatever it is, it's none of our affair." "Her mother was one of my dear- est friends," said Amy with dignity. "A better housekeeper never lived. She asked me to look out for Rita with almost her last breath."
"Pete Hill hauled her up from the station," Paul explained. "He said he never saw such a conglomeration of boxes and paper bags. He was ashamed to come through town with them."
"I understand she's opened her mother's house," put in Jim, looking over his paper. "There's no heat there, but the kitchen range."
"Pack a basket, Mother," said Francine, "and let's get on with Christmas."
"Well, that is a good idea," said Amy, brightening. "It wouldn't take long and it would dispose of one wearisome detail."
"Now, if Paul'll get a tree�" began Francine.
"For Pete's sake! We're all grown. I'm of age, and Francine�"
"Don't say it!" warned Francine. "If a girl gets to be twenty-three she's an old maid."
"Rita's not that old, and she has four children."
"Rita married at seventeen. If you think�" flared Francine.
"Take it away, Sis. I was just teasing."
"It would surprise all of you if I came home some evening with a diamond."
"Has Phil asked you?" Jim questioned, too eagerly.
"Maybe," evaded Francine, "and maybe not."
AMY sighed. She knew Phil hadn't asked Francine, and for the life of her she didn't know why. The dining had started off with all the ease when Phil came to teach in the fall. Moreover, Francine was in love with him, and who wouldn't be�such a big, good-looking fellow, so able to converse, so ready to laugh. Francine was beautiful, well-educated, and as smart as a page from Vogue, a good match for him. But what could her mother do about it? Nothing, except to strike the right note of impersonal hospitality. Men shied away from too much attention, as from a trap.
"Let's see," she said, getting back to the basket for Rita, "some butter and eggs, and I could bake her that chicken. The turkey'll be enough for us . . ."
Jim rustled his paper. "Go a little easy, Amy. Butter and eggs and meat are like gold."
"Why don't you leave it until tomorrow, Mother?" Francine asked.
"I wouldn't sleep a wink!" said Amy. "I should have gone last night, but I was so busy hanging those curtains, and tomorrow will be another busy day, Christmas Eve."
She got some bottled fruit and jam, put in a loaf of bread, and dipped into the Christmas candy and nuts.
"Paul, will you drive me?" she asked.
"I wish you'll make it snappy. I've got a date in about an hour. Thought I'd take my girl to a dance."
THE place looked dark and forbidding when they drove up.
"Doesn't look as if anyone's at home," said Paul.
"There's a little light in the kitchen. I wonder if Rita didn't have the lights turned on."
Paul carried the basket to the door. "I'll wait in the car and listen 810 to the radio, but remember that date." Her knock on the door was answered after some delay by 4a little mite of a girl, hardly able to reach the knob. Two more children, an even smaller girl and a little boy were foraging for crumbs on the kitchen table. Rita was sitting in front of the open oven door, the baby on her lap. They were all even more unkempt than they had been in church. "It's Amy Crandall, isn't it?" said Rita, without getting UP. Rita had been a pretty little thing, with small bones and a piquant face. Her dark-circled eyes and pale lips smote Amy's heart. "I brought you a basket," she said, setting it on the table. A candle, burning on a tin lid in the middle of the table, fought back the shadows as hopelessly as the small fire fought back the cold. "I haven't seen your children before, Rita. How old are they?" Amy asked. "Steven's four, Betty Kay is three, Alene's a year and a half, and the baby's five months," intoned Rita. Amy looked sharply at the baby. "I thought it was much younger. Is it a boy or a girl?" "Is a boy," said Rita listlessly. "I named him Tommy." The baby wasn't asleep, but it was thin and unmoving. Its open eyes were as lusterless as its mother's hair, Amy hardly noticed the other children, who crowded ground their mother shyly, but she thoughtfully spread them some bread and butter, eyeing the baby with growing misgivings, turning Rita's strange behavior over in her mind. "Your baby's sick, Rita," she said finally. "What in the world are you doing here at this time of year? Where's your husband?" "I don't know," said Rita dully. "We quarreled. He said I was lazy. He went away angry: I can't go back. I can't stand any more. Thought if I could get home, some: thing would work out..." Rita's mouth was trembling.. "You poor child! Too," said Amy. You're sick, THE car honked outside. That would be Paul, getting impatient. Amy looked around the room. No lights�no hot water. What "More bread and butter," he said. "Mo', mo'," the little girls echoed. It was more than Amy could stand. "Paul, you�ll have to help me," she said, coming out to the car. "I'm going to take them home with me." "Now, Mother!" protested Paul. "Why don't you just drop a bomb down the chimney and let it go at that? But why?" "I knew you'd be angry�think me sentimental and stupid�insane, but it can't be helped." She outlined briefly what she had found in the house. "Of course, it will just ruin Christmas, but Paul, that baby is going to die if something isn't done right away." She waited for the explosion, but to her surprise Paul got out of the car and came soberly into the house. He bundled the children with an experienced hand, coming back two three times for bundles of dirty clothes Amy had gathered. Finally he took the baby and the basket she had brought, while she helped Rita to the car. Steven was sitting beside him, worshipping him with wide, dark-fringed eyes. "He'd be a cute little shaver if he�" he began, and stopped. Amy knew what he meant, if he were cleaned up. "Paul, I thought you'd be upset." "I had a job like this once before, gathering babies after the Germans had retreated," Paul said gruffly. A MY bustled into the bathroom to run a bath as soon as she was home, leaving the little group huddled in the living room. Francine followed her in. "Mother, what is this? Don't tell me you've brought these creatures home for Christmas!" "I don't just know how long they'll be here, Francie." "But Mother! I've invited Phil for Christmas dinner." "We'll have everything under control by that time." "I can imagine!" said Francine bitterly. "These people are in trouble. They have to be helped." "Well, it's your project," shrugged Francine. "Count me out." "I hoped you'd help me, Francine. The whole bunch has to be fed and bathed. The children have cute little clothes, but they're all dirty. I'll run them through the washer when things quiet down, but right now I have to call Dr. Kane." "Dr. Kane? You mean they're sick?" "I'm afraid so� both Rita and the baby." "Really?" asked Francine. "I suppose I could bathe the baby," she went on grudgingly. "I learned how in my homemaking class at the University. Can't Paul dunk the others?" "And now about Rita . . ." began Amy. "I know," Francine anticipated ungraciously. "Yes, you can put Rita in my bed, and yes, I'll sleep on the living room couch." Amy hadn't had a minute to explain things to Jim. She had glanced at him a time or two in passing. His face was noncommittal, and she knew he was not reading the book he held before it. To be honest, she was afraid to broach him about groceries for a bunch like this. Not that she would blame him. Jim was industrious and honest, but not a brilliant lawyer. He worked hard for his money, and the children seemed to think his pocketbook was a bottomless well of supply. WHEN the doctor arrived an hour later the sleepy-eyed babies were just finishing their soup. They looked like three little angels in some of Paul's white teeshirts, their hair hanging in clean silken rings. Rita was in bed, staring at the ceiling, and Francine was bending anxiously over the baby. "He doesn't move, even to cry. When I turned him over I had to lift his arm. Do you think he'll die?" "I'd better see the mother first," Dr. Kane said when Amy had explained the circumstances. She took him in. He went over Rita thoroughly, keeping up a running 812 which Rita answered in monosyllables or not at all, questions that seemed superficial, but which were cleverly put to conceal a deeper probing. Finally he beckoned Amy out. "I think you got her just in time," he said, and went to look over the baby. "How old is this baby?" he asked. "Five months," Amy told him, and they stood silent as he turned the infant, moving his stethoscope over its tiny chest. Jim got up to peer over Amy's shoulder. "Nothing organically wrong," the doctor finally pronounced, "seems to be malnutrition and toxin from the mother's feedings. Can you care for this child here?" Amy was searching her mind with some misgivings, trying to take all factors into consideration. "Weren't you in one of my classes at the University, young lady?" the doctor asked, addressing Francine. Francine gasped. "Yes, I was," she admitted, "but...." "Fine! Fine!" said the doctor bruskly, "I�ll give you detailed instructions. This will be a good workout for your knowledge. We'll need some prescriptions." "I woan dout if... Af..." Her eyes sought her father and Paul. "Tl foot the bill," said Paul. "I�ll land some kind of job tomorrow." Dr. Kane sat at the desk and wrote a full page of instructions which he handed Francine. "Now, the mother," he said. "Her immediate need is hospitalization." "Hospitalization?" repeated Amy. "Yes. I'll want her there to clear up some physical disturbances of long standing, and for observation. A good psychiatrist may be in order. I want to know how it can be handled financially." "T don't know," said Amy. "Her husband seems to have left her. I know she hasn't any money." "There are agencies for family help if someone can unsnarl the legal difficulties. How about it, Jim?" "Why, sure, sure!" agreed Jim, taken by surprise. "That's right up my alley." "I say, it's pretty decent of you people. Right at Christmas time, too, upsetting all your plans. Looks like you caught them just in time, though." "It's nothing," said Jim, expanding. ~ "When will you want her? In the hospital, I mean." "In the morning, early, as soon as I can make arrangements." "I�ll guarantee the money," said Jim largely. "I might be able to locate that father and get him back | onto the job." "He may need a boost himself. He's pretty young, too, I understand." Paul came out of his room as the doctor was leaving.. "The bairnies are cuddled doon in my room," he said. "How's that for a second-rate papa? Now may I go on my date? I can take a cot in the basement when I get home." "Paul, you're late. What will your girl friend think?" "T called her and told her there existed a state of emergency. She was a good sport. We can still get a little dancing in." "Could you get to the drugstore before it closes, Paul, and get some things I need for the baby?" queried Francine. "Well," said Amy. "Looks as if CHRISTMAS BY EMERGENCY there's nothing left for me to do but the washing." THE house next day was a madhouse. Alene ate all she could hold, and then plastered her bread with the remaining cereal. She smiled enchantingly when Amy went to fetch her. Silken little things,. They were, quick in their fluid baby motions, their sunny heads bobbing everywhere.. "No wonder Rita got sick. I'd be a wreck in a week," said Francine, "but aren't they adorable?" she added. Phil called while Francine was making up the formula. "Tell him I'll call him back, Mother. I can't come just now," she said, but it was more than an hour before she could call him, and then he had gone. "Mother, I wanted to make this Christmas a once-and-for-all with Phil. I can't go on any longer with things at a standstill between us. If I lose Phil because of this baby...." "Well, I'm sure I could relieve you with the baby now that Rita has gone," said Amy. "Oh, no! I couldn't trust him with anyone else," Francine told her. Amy opened her mouth in astonishment, and closed it again. "Those little ones should have something for Christmas," Francine worried, "though I don't suppose they know much about it." Paul came home that evening with a tapered Christmas tree, and with bulging packages of brightly colored balls, lights, and tinseled decorations. "I got a job," he announced, "Beginning the day after Christmas!" 813 His face was shining with excitement. "I'm getting my electric train out for Steven." "Guess who I saw?" he asked the round-eyed children. "Old Santa Claus himself, loaded right up to his ears with gifts for you." "Santa Claus bring me a 'lec'ric shaver like Uncle Paul," Steven said. Betty Kay and Alene clapped their hands. "Santa! Santa!" they shouted. "Well, whatdya know about that? Uncle Paul!" He tousled Steven's hair lovingly. "And I thought Christmas was spoiled for me for good." Jim came in the back way, wearing a look of sheepish guilt and walking in an aura of conspiracy. - "Tye located Rita's husband," he said triumphantly. "Talked to him long distance." "I gave it to him straight, and he's pretty cut up. He's catching the night train and will be here by morning. Dr. Kane thinks that'll do a lot to get Rita ticking again." "Well, he should be made acquainted with some of the damage he's done," said Francine indignantly, going back to the kitchen. She was there when Phil came. "Francine's giving the baby his evening rub," Amy said, "I'll call her." "No, don't. Let me go in." He tiptoed awkwardly, balancing his big frame, and stood in the doorway, watching Francine. "Mother! Mother!" she was saying excitedly, "Tommy smiled at me! Isn't that wonderful? Come and see if you don't think he is plumper and brighter already." She looked up then, and saw Phil, and Amy had never seen her more beautiful, her face flushed and shining, her hair tumbled in soft curls about her face.
"Phil, I look a sight!"
"You surely do, but don't worry. I'm a man that likes to take off my shoes after a hard day's work. So this is the rival I've come to joust with! Well, I brought his choice weapons," he said, fishing a rattle box out of his pocket.
"Phil, who told you?"
"I got it straight from Dr. Kane, and when this little guy nosed me out on the telephone, I was jealous. I'll have you know."
Amy decided this was her cue to retreat from the door where she had followed Phil. In the living room
Paul and Jim were decorating the tree, retrieving the fragile balls from Betty Kay, rescuing the strings of lights from Steven's wild assistance, and untangling Alene from yards of flashing tinsel.
"There are bushels of jeeps and dolls in the basement," Jim said, "oranges and gingercks to put in the stockings. It will be something to see their faces in the morning."
"Christmas is a wonderful time of year," sighed Amy happily.
"You know, Amy! We need some grandchildren of our own."
"In due time, Jim," said Amy complacently, indicating a rapturous shadow on the kitchen door. It showed a perfect outline of Phil kissing Francine.
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
In Memory of My Mother
Alice Whitson Norton
Along a gaily festooned street, I walked amid a happy throng, And with them listened eagerly To puppets sing a Christmas song.
In crowded shops I purchased gifts, Recalling wishes I once knew� A watch, a rug, a silver vase, And then, beloved, I thought of you.
You always asked for little things Like thimbles�scissors�mending thread; And patiently my poor heart broke� Remembering that you were dead.
Then I bought toys and gave them out To urchins round me, sad of face. This was my Christmas gift to you, Filling, as best I knew, your place. WINTER BLOSSOMINC Beatrice K. Ekman I who cherish beauty shall remember No flower is more lovely than the sight Of winter-blossomed boughs in late December With tremulous impermanence of white.
Snow had caught and clung to rain-washed hedges; The fragile blossoms piled on bush and tree, The garden pool was dark to shallow edges Where reeds were regal as the fleur-de-lis.
I looked in awe upon this world transcendence Beneath ephemeral gray of opal sky, And found no word portraying the resplendence Of beauty's silence . . . piercing as a cry. Page 815 Skids for Santa Grace Cozzens OUIS Stuart was a natural born rhymer, but he could see no rhyme or reason for the jam they were in. Stella was right, he should have listened to old trapper Pete and got off the dry farm and out of the hills by the middle of November, then they wouldn't have been snowed in, "We gotta get out of here, Daddy," seven-year-old Roy was Saying. He climbed astraddle his father's knee. "Even old Pete'll have turkey and plum pudding. It won't seem like Christmas up here all alone." Lou stroked Roy's brown, curly head. "Sure it will, Son. Don't you see, we're not up here 'all alone? Listen to this: Let Christmas morning come, We'll beat a milk pan for a drum, And call the forest folk together� Beasts of every fur and birds of every feather; And we'll give them Christmas cheer hey'v� missed for many a year,,,, "We'll have fun. Don't you worry about that," Five-year-old Ann climbed on his other knee. "How about Sandy Claus, can he find our house?" "'Course he can, big silly," Roy shouted. "Old Sandy Claus -can find kids anywhere." He shoved his hand into his pocket. "Look, here's my letter to him. Read it, Daddy." Lou took the slip and read: Dear old Sandy Claus: me a jumping jack rabbit a a sock full of candy and nuts, Roy Stuart Page 816 Lou folded the note and handed it back, 1 Could b up here any more than we can make it down the canyon." "He's only teasing you," Roy laughed. "Daddies always talk like that before Christmas." Louis looked at the glowing faces before him and his breath frittered away. Words failed him. How could he make them understand that Santa wasn't coming? If the storm had held off one more day, he would have had his little family settled in town for the winter. The day the last load of grain Was sent off to the elevator the sky Save promise of a bright tomorrow, but somewhere between midnight and dawn snow began to fall and a wind came up, blocking the Toad, and for over three weeks he had been trying to dig out, OW it was Christmas Eve and two starry-eyed tots were looking forward to Christmas morning. He looked across the room at Stella, with her brown hair wound into a heavy bun on the back of her neck, unpacking the things she had packed weeks ago to take along in case there was a chance to get away. Her eyes met his. She smiled, but her lashes were wet. SKIDS FOR SANTA "Jumping junipers!" he thought. "Just what are we going to do?" Roy slid off his knee and began hauling a handful of things from his pocket. He sorted out two nails. "Get the hammer, Ann," he said. "Here, Daddy. If we've gotta stay we better drive these nails in the wall to hang our stockings on." - Louis took the big hammer from Ann's small hands. "We'll drive 'em,' he said slowly. "But don't forget what I told you about old St. Nick maybe getting stalled in the snow up the canyon."  "You're only teasing," Roy giggled, handing his father a nail. "Sandy's reindeer sail right through the air over house tops." Lou drove the nails in the rail above the fireplace and stepped to the window. He fingered his chin and stared hard at the glistening snow over the landscape and at the glittering stars overhead. It had been so for weeks. The sky would hold clear and blue for days while he dug like a rat through the snowdrifts, four and a half miles, to the top of the hill and within a couple. Of miles of the highway, then it would cloud up and storm again be- - fore he could get the family out. But he never gave up hope of getting out, really, until that afternoon. For two days he had used his scraper and team, and this time he was within a stone's throw of the highway, when a breeze stirred up from the north, clouds drifted up from 'the west, arid the sky ran down like 'a leaden screen, behind the saw- 'tooth ridge. And in no time the storm ruined his work. His trenches were packed with fresh white snow which no automobile or team and wagon could buck. 817 STELLA came and stood at his side, looking out upon the far stretch of snow-capped trees. "If old Pete had stayed," she murmured, "the smoke from his chimney would have made it less lonely." Lou snorted. "If I hadn't given the old scalawag a lift to town after he helped me dig out the first time, he could have helped me get packed and we would all be out." "Don't blame Pete," she said. "He warned you not to tinker around. Said rats and mink were taking on extra heavy fur."  Roy ran up to them. "I'll bet it's Pete's fault. He got mad at me for springing some of his traps. He said he'd bet Sandy would skip right past my stocking this year. Is he a witch, Daddy?" "No, Son," Lou said vacantly, "you should be more careful around his traps." Stella turned away. "Come on, Children. Now you have your stockings hung you had better get to bed." Roy and Ann scampered into the bedroom, unbuttoning as they went. Lou swung round and looked sharply at Stella. "For the love o'Pete!" he gulped. "Now, what did you say that for?" Stella stood smiling. "I have it." "Have what?" Lou squinted. "A bright idea," she whispered. "Spill it," Lou said. "We need ideas." "Gingerbread men!" 'she whispered. Lou grabbed at the straw and led her to the kitchen. "In nothing flat," he grinned, "all in shapes of camels and St. Nicks. " She nodded. "With red and green -coats."' 818 He stirred the fire and added wood. "Let's get started," he mumbled. "I'm going to try MY hand at cutting out a rabbit, a monkey, and maybe a jumping jack. And how about you dressing UP 4 fancy doll?" "Quit talking," Roy called. "I Stella put her finger to het lips. "Let's be quiet till they're asleep." They sat still as mice. Outside the night wind whistled and moaned message, "Holy night. All is right." Stella whispered, "Think of the different scenes that old moon and bright star are looking down upon." ee nodded. He tiptoed across the room and closed the bedroom door. "Don't shut it. I can't go to sleep," came Roy's drowsy voice. Lou opened the door again and sat back down beside Stella and waited. After awhile he stirred the fire and added wood. It was nearing midnight when Stella got out the sugar, flour, shortening, eggs, and spices. Lou tied on an apron and found a paring knife. Stella mixed and rolled the dough. Together, they cut out shapes, chuckling and laying them carefully on a wide cookie sheet. While the cookies were baking Lou helped Stella mix red, green, and yellow icing. In twenty minutes she pulled the pan of golden-brown spicy ginger breads from the oven. Lou looked over her shoulder and gripped her arms warmly. "Yummy!" he chuckled. "Lock at that monkey and those rabbits, and your St. Nicks and camels! Now for the frosting. --- He stiffened. A hinge had creaked behind him. He turned, guiltily. Roy stood in the doorway, rubbing his eye Stella's hand flew to her throat. Lou stepped forth with apron spread.. "Hey, Daddy," Roy grinned sleepily. "You look like a old woman shooing chickens." "T am," Lou fumbled. "Shooing you back to bed, Mister, if you want Santa Claus to come." "Gimme a cookie and I'll go," Roy "NO!" Lou snapped. "You'll get crumbs�W hat cookies?" "A camel you were talking about. And shoved him back into the bedroom and banged Stella just stood, looking. Lou shrugged. "Skunked again. The innocent little rascal. 1 never could sleep on Christmas Eve, either. You look pale, Stel. Don't g0 to fainting. I feel like jumping out the window." He began pacing the floor. "What in Sam Hill will we do now?" Stella began frosting cookies. She sighed, "Put these in�" Lou barked low. "No! Roy'll catch on " Stella took a hard breath. "We'll have to explain..- a "Not as long as! Remember what Christmas meant to me, we won't!" Lou announced. "Not if I have to..-. "What?" Stella sighed. He dropped astride "That's the rub." SKIDS FOR SANTA HTHE latch hadn't caught and the bedroom door swung slowly open. Roy was sitting up in bed. "Know what I dreamed?" he called out. "I dreamed I saw Sandy Claus coming up the canyon, with a whip whirling over his head and he was driving four old black bears. The bears had bells around their necks and there was a sack of toys in the back of the sled." Lou shut the bedroom door and shot a sidelong glance at Stella. "In after years, it  might be fun telling the kids all about it," he mumbled, in an undertone, "how I ran myself down trying to catch a fawn or a rabbit. How I tried to snare a bird. Anything to make a little excitement for Christmas morning. How I even jimmied old Pete's window and searched his house for a pelt or two to make furry toys. But the old scamp had left his hut as clean as a whistle." He ran his fingers through his hair. "And now the cookies " Lou lifted his chin and leaned forward. Were his ears ringing? By golly, had he gone plumb daffy? He must be, to hear bells in this neck of the woods. But Stella was listening, too, not only to bells, but to something else screaming across the night like a siren. Lou sprang to the door and swung it open. Stella darted to his side. He barked. "Look! There it is coming down bald ridge like a bullet. Past old Pete's hut, in a beeline for here!" Roy jumped out of bed and ran to his father's side. Lou caught his hand and Stella's arm. "Look out!" he cried, pulling them aside. The next second the flying object skidded in through the door on a pair of skiis that reached half across the room. On them was a squat form in a red suit and cap, with hair and beard as white as cotton and all matted with frost and icicles. A strand of sleigh-bells was around his neck and on his plump back was a pack with a red and yellow striped whistle sticking out of the top. Lou grinned. Stella gasped. "It's Sandy Claus," Roy yelped, darting for the bed, diving in and covering up his head. Louis closed the bedroom door and made sure the latch caught. "Hey!" Roy shouted the next morning, while he danced with Ann around their stockings. "Old Sandy Claus didn't bring me a thing I asked for, except the nuts and candy. But, boy! He knew what I wanted better'n I did." After awhile he called, "Look, Daddy, smoke is coming out of old Pete�s stovepipe.� Louis Stuart strode to the window, "By golly, there is," he said. "Guess we'll have to ask the old skate over to Christmas dinner."

Prince and Princess of Wales are having a little trouble; their three daughters while
abroad contracted the measles. . . . The Princess has nursed them with untiring devotion,
and by so doing sets an example to all mothers worthy of imitation, and although
a Princess, she never for one moment forgets that she is a mother, and her children
claim her attention and care before all else. � Marion
TO THE BELOVED MEMORY OF ELIZA R. SNOW SMITH
Would that my muse might fitting numbers wake,
Mem'ry sweet echoes for a loved one's sake;

Supreme o'er sorrow and life's varied wrongs,
Her soul learned lessons that she wrought in songs.

A TRIBUTE OF AFFECTION: Early on the morning of Monday, December 5,
1887, in the Lion House, Salt Lake City, at five minutes past one o'clock, the spirit of
our beloved "Sister Eliza" passed away from earth, as she herself had so beautifully
expressed, "To unite with the choirs in celestial love" .... Her name is engraved imperishably
in the hearts of the people. Her life and character were in perfect keeping
with the holy religion she had embraced. Her example is before all Israel, and accords
harmoniously with the teachings she has given, and the precepts she has taught. � Ed.
LETTER FROM ARIZONA: Dear Sisters:� Letters are the links that bind us
to our old homes, friends and associations; the carrier doves bearing the messages from
heart to heart. Would it not be terrible if we could not write to our absent ones, and
yet how many fail to improve this great privilege. We have moved our "camp" again
(it seems to me that all Israel is one "tented field" just now), this only makes nine
times that I have changed my abiding place since I came here. . . . We are located at
present near a very large ruin, one of those monuments of a departed race, that are
found to be everywhere in this land. . . . This place is improving slowly; it takes hard
work, time, patience and perseverance, with the blessings of God to redeem the waste
places of Zion. � S.E.R.

Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid (John 14:27).
THE yearning for peace is always with us, an urgent desire of those who seek the true meaning of life. Particularly at Christmas time our hearts are filled with a great longing to see the establishment of peace upon the earth, that other gifts may be added unto it.
And yet the path to peace is not easily ascended; the path to peace is little understood. It is a way that few individuals, few nations have found. The world, as a whole, has never achieved it.
Long ago in the hill country of Judea the Savior taught that peace must begin with the individual. It must first be a spiritual attainment. When all the intricate values of life are weighed and given their proper proportions, then personal peace is established. It does not depend wholly upon time or place or age, nor even upon the conditions of health or economic position, for peace is essentially an attitude whereby a person realizes that he may control his own spiritual destiny. As Paul, the apostle, explained, "to be spiritually minded is life and peace" (Romans 8:6).
The individual does not stand alone, however. The phases of life are like the ripples from a stone thrown into a placid lake. Each ripple reaches out and becomes a part of a larger circle. Each well-adjusted and harmonious family brings relatives and friends and social groups into an ever-widening circle of accord.
Thus, we who hope for peace in the world should remember that our own houses must be set in order before we can be an example which will merit the respect of other people and will be an influence in creating harmony in the world.
Peace, moreover, involves the direct truth: I am my brother's keeper. No group can find an ideal peace when want and insecurity exist among its members. This principle was clearly understood by our early Church leaders and is recognized today in our extensive and effective Church Welfare Program, and in the unity which binds Church members together for a common purpose.
A nation which has not established peace within its borders is fundamentally weak whatever be the outface veneer of power. When strength and well-being and opportunity are sacrificed to strife, the strong, high walls of a nation begin to crumble.
In this season of Christmas let us remember the significance of the angels' message, which was intended for all men everywhere to hear. It is world peace for which we must work and pray. No lesser objective will satisfy our highest hopes. It is world peace for which the cherished anthems are sung. It is world peace of which carolers think as they sing
the well-beloved songs of many nations.
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: And the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, the everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6).

Support the "Family Hour"
AT the recent great October general Church conference, the sisters of the Relief Society�the women and mothers of the Church�were called upon to support the "Family Hour" observance, with the promise of blessings which would be given their families by such action. Relief Society visiting teachers were authorized to serve as messengers to deliver an instruction pamphlet "The Family Hour" in every Latter-day Saint home.
The General Board calls upon the sisters of the Church to lend their active and persistent support to this worthwhile Church program. It is designed to be a year-round activity held usually in the home, but at times out-of-doors or at other places. Its prime purpose is to bring the family members closer together that eternal bands may be tightened around them, with love, unselfishness, obedience, and understanding.
As the families in the Church become more righteous, the entire Church will reflect this spirit and the Lord's work will be pushed forward at an accelerated pace.
The "Family Hour" is intended to be a happy, natural family gathering, permeated with joy. Upon the mother in the home will depend much of its success. She can, by her influence and encouragement, see that each member participates. She can make it a special occasion which will stand out in the memory of her family throughout its life. By careful planning, the gathering may be of such interest as to appeal to each member. After the "Family Hour" is successfully launched, then turns may be taken by different family members in planning future gatherings. Special refreshments will add to the occasion.
Mothers should never lose sight of the great underlying purposes of "The Family Hour" and should devote themselves unselfishly to the perpetuation of this observance in their families. The rewards which come to fathers and mothers by working patiently with their children will be everlasting rewards which will endure throughout the eternities.
May every mother in the Church help establish a "Family Hour" in her family, to be conducted under the direction of the Priesthood in her home.
