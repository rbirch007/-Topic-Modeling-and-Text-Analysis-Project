Make the Children Happy SUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING CHRISTMAS PRESENTS, Elizabeth Williamson YOU can look forward to a lot of fun if you decide to make presents for the children this Christmas. If you sew, crochet, knit, or paint a little, there are endless possibilities. If you have no talents whatsoever, there are many simple things to make that children will love. Here are a few suggestions: If You Sew: Aprons, organdy for dress-up, chambray for everyday Pinafores Doll clothes (You can get doll clothes patterns) Doll hats Stuffed animals, scraps and yarn Felt bags and purses, using pinking scissors for trimming effects, and appliqued flowers, birds, or animals made of calico of felt Bean bags Marble bags _Initialed, or names Jack bags embroidered in yarn Leather pouches, nice and sturdy for boys If You Knit: Mittens Gloves All personalized, so the Sweaters > child will feel they are Scarves \ meant especially for him Caps Balls, made of soft, knitted, triangular pieces, sewn together and filled with kapok or cotton Page 826 If You Crochet: Bed slippers Little lace collars and cuffs for velvet party dresses Jackets, caps, robes for babies If You Paint: Plastic glasses in bright colors, child's name in contrasting enamel paint. Add a few polka dots, stars, crosses, or scallops around the top and bottom. With this, and a gay new toothbrush to match, you will have a gift to delight any child. Plain glasses, decorated with little designs in enamel�something characteristic of the child, plus his name, is certain to please. Miniature drums made from round, pint ice-cream cartons. Paint the drum navy blue, insert red cord diagonally around the carton. Make two slits at the top, add two drumsticks, painted red. Baby's rattle. Decorate cartons with gay designs, fill with small pebbles (four or five are sufficient). Be sure the top is fastened securely with glue or stitching. If You Own a Jig-Saw: Cradles Rocking horses Puzzles Little shelves Doll furniture If You Cook: Cookies in various interesting shapes: stars, hearts, Santas, bells, popcorn balls, pink popcorn, lollypops, and candy canes. Packaged attractively, these are very welcome gifts. MAKE THE CHILDREN HAPPY Peace, Be Still Marguerite I. Griffin darkness of midnight its brazen white flashes illumined the velvet hills and exposed them in their slumber- Intermittent Streaks, more brilliant than man's neon, shot across the starless heavens and were punctuated by earsplitting blasts of thunder. To the north, old Squaw Butte was spasmodically silhouetted with startling brilliance, but only for a moment at a time, as though it were a mighty citadel being bombarded by nature itself. And I thought, as the wind mourned through the trees outside my little house and brought to my nostrils the odor of raindrops on hot, dry soil, how great, yet how terrible is the power of God. In the words of the psalmist: The Lord also thundered in the  heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils (Psalm 18:13-15). And I thought, what could be the power of men, even with their atom bombs, if God our Heavenly Father chose to strike them with his great power? I could not sleep. I could only watch through my open window, fascinated, yet distinctly uneasy, too. I was not used to thunder and lightning. It frightened me. It was so Page 828 big, so noisy. It filled my world with flashes of light and crashing din, and my lips involuntarily breathed a prayer: "Dear Lord, protect our home, our loved ones, our animals, our flocks.� In crying out to him, I thought quite clearly of him who has the power to still the storm, who has the power to preserve and to protect. It seemed as though the flashes of light outside silhouetted in my mind that story of long ago, when Jesus and his disciples were in a ship upon the sea, and a great storm of wind arose, "and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full." But Jesus was undisturbed through it all, for "he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow . . . ." Yes, he had been full of compassion for the lame, the halt, the blind. He had taught saving  parables of eternal life to the multitude for long hours, and now he was weary and his physical body lay relaxed, asleep. Lie who was to know all depths of sorrow and of pain, knew no fear at this moment. Yet his disciples in their anxiety, yes, in their terror, ". . . . awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?" "And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm." As simple as that. He had known his power was greater than that of wind or wave or storm. He could sleep quietly through it all, knowing that "the earth is the Lord's, and PEACE, BE STILL the fulness thereof;" and that while he was about his "Father's business" he would have his full protection. No force of nature could subdue the Son of Man. "And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith? _ "And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" ES, indeed. What manner of man is this? Oh, ye nations of the earth, he is your Lord, your Redeemer, the Prince of Peace. This is he who said, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." This is he who is the light shining in darkness and the world too long has comprehended it not. This is he who taught, "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. And strangely enough all fear left my being as I watched the shafts of light cut across the night sky, for I remembered what I had forgotten� that God, who lives as surely as you and I, controls the power of the elements and governs the destinies of all men who will serve him. These flashes of light and pealings of thunder, this rush of wind outside my 829 house, these were spectacular but they were nothing to dread. Instead, there were bigger things to fear, quiet things that could creep like shadows into the dark places of my life, or more subtly, more dangerously, into the tender lives of my children, tentacles from the sins of the world that reach out gently at first, only to crush finally with the grasp of hopeless servitude. Yes, rather we "should fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body" and shun him and build a barricade of righteousness about our hearts to keep him out. Tonight, all nature was in protest against the summer heat, but my children were safe in their own snug beds. Tonight there was no danger. That would come in unexpected moments tomorrow, next week, next year. Dear Lord, protect my children. Help me make them strong.: I crept back into my own bed, and when next I opened my eyes, the world was calm, the skies were blue, and the sunshine bright. And now where the wind had must night vexed the leaves of the trees, hosts of birds were warbling a glad welcome to the new day. Dear Heavenly Father, give me the strength of the birds, the ability to sing after any storm that may beset my life!

Atari Where Trails Run Out Anna Prince Redd CHAPTER 11 [The incidents of this story are truce, and the characters authentic. The information has been carefully gleaned from diaries, journals, and personal interviews.�Ed.] ' Synopsis: A company of twenty-four young men and two families�James L. Davis, his wife, Mary, and their four children; Henry H. Harriman, his wife, Elizabeth, and their five children�are called to explore a route from Cedar City, in Southern Utah, to San Juan County. The two families are to remain in San Juan and prepare for the coming of the main company. The company, after much suffering, finally reaches Moenkopi. The Davis family remains there and the others go on toward the San Juan. Scouts return to Moenkopi and report the arrival of the Harrimans on the San Juan. The James L. Davis family and the scouts leave to join the Harrimans, and Mary and Elizabeth are reunited. Mary's baby is born after a difficult confinement. _The families at Montezuma are destitute for food and there is much trouble with unfriendly Indians. One of the Harriman children dies; George Hobbs arrives with word that the main company will soon join the pioneers on the San Juan. Were at work on the river dam, when a friendly Indian runner came dashing across the ford and up the bank, waving his arms and shouting: "Many white men and their squaws have come! On the banks of the San Juan, they sit down. Heap tired. Horses no pull. All the time the white men sit down!" "Tt is the second company!" James and Henry cried in unison. And away they raced to James' house, where Mary and Elizabeth were. Ke and Henry Harriman "They've come, girls!" they cried. "Our friends have got through at last!" "God be praised!" Elizabeth exclaimed. Mary had not taken her eyes from James' face. He began to shift uncomfortably, and avoided her eyes. "Why don't we go to meet them, James?" she asked, knowing from his nervous shiftings that something was wrong. "We can't go to meet them Mary," Henry replied, relieving James of the responsibility of answering. "They are miles down the river. This good Lamanite brought us word." The women sat down, suddenly, too disappointed for speech. The Indian stepped forward and began to explain as fluently as he could: "Two suns, and white men come here. River place no_ big! Some move wagons. Some stay!" Relief and joy were unmistakable in everyone's face. 'The Indian smiled proudly. Turning to James and Henry, he asked: "You squaws heap glad! Like um more folks to come here, huh?" "White men bring us food," said James. "Long time, no eat," Henry added for good measure. The Indian shook his head negatively. "Long time, no eat?" he Page 831 832 questioned. "White men on river want food, too!" Not grasping the full import of the Indian's words, Henry explained patiently, "Long time, no eat. Two moons, only little bit bread. White men come. White men bring food to Montezuma." Again the Indian shook his head. "No savvy," he said. "Heap no savvy! Maybe so paper talk tell about food." From a pouch that hung from his waist, the Indian extracted a crumpled bit of paper. "A letter!" Elizabeth exclaimed. And then in a voice that was mixed with eagerness and dread, she asked James to read the letter. Mary just stood still and listened. James smoothed out the bit of wrapping paper, and read aloud: Bluff, Utah San Juan County, April 1st, 1880 Elder James L. Davis Montezuma Settlement, San Juan Mission, San Juan Dear Brother Davis: This is to inform you that this day the San Juan Mission Company reached the San Juan, and, unable to continue on up the river to your location, have designated a town site here, and we have named it "Bluff City." We are very worn out, and our food supply is low. But we are instructed to send a generous portion of what we have to you, at the outpost of this mission. We, therefore, have dispatched this food supply to you, by those of the company, who, having drawn blank slips in the land lottery here, will go on to Montezuma Settlement and live near you. May God bless and prosper you in your faithful labors. Your brother in the Gospel, Platt De Alton Lyman, First Counselor to Silas S. Smith President of the San Juan Mission "THERE was a profound silence during the reading of the letter and for some minutes afterward. Then everyone began to talk at once. "Isn't it wonderfull" Elizabeth cried. "I can hardly believe that we shall see our friends so soon. People from our very own homes!" "We can hold Church and have a real school!" Mary exclaimed. "There'll be other women like ourselves," she added. "Neighbors and friends!" And for sheer joy she began to weep. James Davis executed a dance step, and swung Henry Harman around the room with him. "There'll be people to buy things, Henry," he contributed. "Now I can have my long-dreamed-of store!" They stopped dancing, and James blew his nose vigorously. "We'll have a post office, and get the news," Henry said, as though he could not believe his own words. "It's really so." James grabbed the ladies' hands, and they caught hold of Henry, and away they circled, too happy to wonder why they were frightening their children so. Wide-eyed, the children watched their parents, too dazed by the sudden excitement to show any feelings at all. In the midst of this rejoicing, Ted Davis came racing into the yard. "Pal" he cried. "Pal The milk cows are gone!" James Davis whirled toward his son, consternation and_ disbelief written in his face. "Ted, my boy," he said thickly, "don't joke with your Pa. Not at a time like this!' "I'm not joking, Pa!" Ted cried. "Come and see for yourself!" Walking like an old man, tired WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT of his years, James Davis followed his son to the enclosure where the last of his cows had been guarded. Waiting for them to calve, promising the little ones plenty of good milk to drink, had been ail that had kept the family from complete discouragement. Now, even that hope was gone! "I�ll follow the Indians, Pal" Ted cried. "It's my fault that the cows are gone. I went to set my coyote traps and the Indians came." "You have done the same before, my boy Ted, and the cows were safe. You couldn't stay by the enclosure all the time, there was other work to do." "I�ll find our cows, Pa. I've got to find 'em�for Ma and little Ethel." "It's too risky, Son. Your life is more to us than a herd of cows!" "But little Ethel's got to have milk, Pa!" Ted insisted. "I got to go, Pa!" James turned back to the house. "We'll let your mother say, Ted. I think you best not go." "Ma, I'm goin' after the cows!" Ted cried. "Say that I should, Ma." James looked at Mary, sitting apathetically before the fire, her hands locked in her lap. "What do you say, Mary?" he asked. "He may fall into the hands of the Indians." "He has to go." Mary's eyes were anguished, her voice was unnaturally tense. "Tl be careful, Ma," Ted promised. "I think I know right where to look for the cows." "You be home by tomorrow at noon," Mary said sharply. "Cows Or no cows!" James followed his son into the 833 yard, saw him mount his pony and tide away. "May the Lord protect my boy," he prayed. IGHT came down, quietly as dew falling, and the stars came out, shining like tinsel. Mary stood in the open doorway, numb to the April air, breathing each breath as a painful duty. James came in from the woodpile with his arms piled up with pitch faggots. "We'll not need to make a light down the path, James," Mary said. "Our Ted will not come tonight." She closed the door and went to sit before the fire to knit and wait. Wait and knit! She counted the coyotes by their yelping, the hours by the beat of her heart. Morning came. Its clear, thin light dimmed the fire embers and rested on James' features as they sagged in sleep. Mary's eyes ranged over the distant hills. She watched the shadows until they climbed to the summits. She awakened James and the children and gave them a small portion of bran, browned and made into broth. "I hoped there would be clouds," she said to James. "An Indian could spot Ted for miles away, in this clear light. God might have helped us with some clouds." James gasped. Never had Mary spoken like that before. He could not reproach her nor comfort her. He could only wait. Mary marked the sun's height. She saw it go higher and higher, until for one suspended instant it centered the sky. Then it moved lower and lower toward the west. At two o'clock James came back from working on the river dam. "I'll go hunt for our boy Ted," he announced. "I must go." Mary said, "Yes, James. But you won't find him." James answered wearily: believe, Mary. You have had faith. Try to exercise it now." "You had ~ better go, James." Mary got up and went to the door to look out, "Go, James! Go now, or I'll start screaming and never stop!" James stood helplessly. "I can't leave you like this, Mary," he said. "T just can't." Emily took her father by the hand and led him to the door. "Mind Mama," she said imperatively, "Mama knows what is best. She has to have Ted." James left on foot, not stopping to look back. After 4 long walk, he climbed to the top of a peak and looked in every direction. But it was such broken up country that he could not see far ahead. At a loss which way to go, he stood still and tried to think. Almost as if it were a voice, the thought came to him: The Lord knows where your boy is, ask him. Feeling very unworthy, James began to pray. He asked the Lord to overlook his human weaknesses. He reminded the Lord that he had giyen the work of his hands and the love of his heart to the furtherance of the Church. He asked the Lord to help him now. He arose and looked out over the country again, and, on q hill three miles away, he saw Ted, as plain as life, riding his horse, with his gun against his shoulder. With a joy that could only be expressed in tears, James turned home. Ted-was alive! He had not found the cows, but that did not matter. Was safe! - His boy Ted WHEN the hills were too steep for upright locomotion, James slid or rolled down them. Mary was waiting for him at the ford. "I saw Ted!" James cried. "He is safe!" Mary looked at him skeptically, "If you saw him, why didn't you bring him home to me?" she asked sharply. "He will be home in about an hour," James assured her. "TI tell you, I saw him." "You are quite sure?" Mary asked. "I saw him as plainly as I see you, Mary," James repeated, "but he did not have the cows." Mary began to laugh�shrill, high laughter that sent the blood in purple waves to her face. "You saw him! You saw him!" she screamed. "Yet it is dark and he is not here!" | "Mary, stop it? James commanded. "Stop laughing or ['ll throw you in that water there. As I stand here, I tell you I saw my boy Ted! Something has happened to him since then," Mary began to cry, pitifully, like a little girl. James took her in his arms, comforting her awkwardly, Praying for wisdom. It came to him, then, that he had asked the Lord to show him whether his son were alive or dead. Saying that Ted would be home in an hour, was anxious presumption. He would take Mary to the house, and, dark as it was, he would go out to look for Ted. He had gone only a few yards from the house, when he heard the  WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT whinny of a horse. It was Stag, Ted's pony. Straining his eyes to see past the barrier of darkness, the father waited, counting the lagging steps of the horse, dreading to see that it was riderless. "Pa!" Ted's voice rang in the darkness. "Pa! Is that you standing there? Or an Indian?" "Tt's Pa, Edward!" James called back. "Thanks be to the Lord, you've come." Ted slid from his pony and embraced his father. "I�I�didn't find the cows, Pa," he choked. "I know, Edward, but we'll manage somehow. You run to the house to your mother. I'll take care of Stag." "Bur Pa, I was miles away from that peak at the time you say you saw me!" Ted's 'voice was grave and positive. James and his son were finishing a new log building which was to be a store and post office for the new Montezuma settlement, a_ straggling line of twenty families, strung up and down the San Juan river. "I know the peak you mean, Pa," Ted said, "and I wouldn't a rode Stag on it, even if I could have. It would have been too easy for Indians to spot me. No horse could get a footing on that peak, anyway, Pa." He waited for an answer, but James Davis just pounded away at the board he was nailing. There was a set line to his jaw that kept Ted from arguing the point. Instead he went on casually, "I rode the bottom lands, out of sight." After a little while, James said: "I've been back to that peak since, Edward, and I couldn't climb it on foot." 835 "Then how do ycu make out that you saw me, Pa?" Ted stopped his work and looked earnestly at his father. "T don't know, and I don't try to explain it, Edward. I just accept it as the testimony it is." "I guess you're right, Pa." They worked in silence for a while, and then Ted asked diffidently, "Why don't you call me your boy Ted any more, Pa?" "I can't, Edward. Since that night your rightful name has seemed good to me." "I guess I grew up that night, Pa." "It seems so, Edward. It seems MARY and Elizabeth often talked of their experiences. Though many new families had moved from Bluff to the Montezuma, the homesteads were too far apart for daily intercourse, and the original families were still left to their own resources. "Do you think you will ever like this place, Elizabeth?" Mary asked one afternoon, as she and her friend picked bullberries from the long, thorny branches of the bullberry trees that grew like a thicket along the river land. "IT don't know, Mary. I'm still frightened of the river. If the trouble with the Indians ever ceases, I might be able to like it here a little better. But we wouldn't dare be this far from our houses, if we weren't in plain sight of your husband and Ted at work there on the water wheel. But I hated the river the minute I looked at it. I guess I always will." WAYNE WONDERLAND Southeastern Utah "Well, at least we have food, now, Elizabeth, And we are doing pretty well financially," Mary said. "Yes, we have food," Elizabeth replied sadly. "And the more we have, the more I think of how our children cried for even a little dry crumb of bread."  It's good to have a branch of the Church here, to celebrate the holidays, and visit with friends and neighbors," Mary reminded Elizabeth. "I try to forget those bitter first years." "I�ll never forget them," Elizabeth answered. "Nor the trip to San Juan, either." Elizabeth lowered her voice confidentially, and, l leaving her bucket of berries hanging on a limb, she went over to Mary. "There is something I've wanted to tell you for years, Mary," she confided. "It seems so foolish to be remembering it all this time, but I just have to tell it to someone." Mary looked at her friend in surprise. "Why, Elizabeth!" she exclaimed. "We've had so many lonely hours in which to talk, that I didn't dream you had a secret." "It's not, exactly," Elizabeth laughed. "It's just an experience that keeps me guessing.� She told Mary about the strange Indian who had frightened her so that night on the desert when they had first begun the trip to San Juan. MARY looked at Elizabeth speculatively. "And all these years you've been expecting to see him again?" she asked. "That's exactly it. I feel sort of foolish, waiting for him, trying to see him in every unusual Indian that comes to the settlement," Elizabeth answered. "Did you ever find out who, or what, made that strange, long call that night, just before you discovered Lost Spring, that wonderful spiritual experience that you had, Elizabeth?" WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT "Why, no, Mary. I'd sort of forgotten about that." "TI. Bet it had something to do with your Indian friend," Mary surmised, thinking of her own Indian friend, Jim Joe, who had led James and her out of Pearson's country. "I've always had the feeling that the mysterious 'human spirit' the Indians whisper about is none other than Jim Joe, the best friend a white man has in this reservation." "I wonder," Elizabeth mused. "Describe Jim Joe to me, Mary." "In looks, he's not much different from any other manly Indian," Mary replied, "but his bearing is that of a proud, freeborn citizen of America, and of any land, for that matter. He is tall, straightforward and fearless�and, well, sort of mysterious." Philip Tompkins 837 "But you know at once that he is a friend?" Elizabeth queried. "Yes. That is the most unusual thing about Jim Joe." Mary looked at Elizabeth speculatively. "You are expecting to hear from him, or see him, soon, aren't you Elizabeth?" "Yes. There is trouble brewing with the Indians. We might need such a friend as Jim Joe before we get through with the next few months. Word has just come that a tribesman has been killed by the whites, and the Indians are seeking revenge. The Indians who told Henry about it were excited, and afraid of being seen by their own tribesmen, but they took the risk and came to warn us. They are gathering near the Mitchell ranch!" Mary looked nervously toward the Mitchell place. "I guess we have enough berries," she suggested. "Let's go home, Elizabeth." KITCHEN HOUSE IN SOUTHEASTERN UTAH THAT night, James Davis closed his store early. "This is the first place the Indians will come," he thought, as he locked the door. He stood with the key half-turned in the lock, thinking. Then he re-entered the store, took up the gun he always kept loaded beneath the counter, threw the lever, and put the cartridges in his pocket.
"Now, I wonder why I did that," he mused aloud, as he walked to his home. "I better not let anyone know I did it."
The Indians came, and were angry that the store was closed up. They tried to talk to them, but they were too excited to be reasoned with. Thinking that he would be as wise as he could, James told Ted to open the store and give them what they wanted. By doing so, he hoped to keep them from stealing or destroying everything he had.

Ted was unwilling to do as his father said, and when the Indians got impatient and quarrelsome, he kept answering them back.
"Don't talk so, Edward," James commanded sternly. "You are inciting the Indians to do almost anything."
But Ted was too angry himself to be reasoned with.
"You are sick!" Ted cried to a big Indian that took hold of him. "You are heap sick!"
The Indian drew back in fear. Mormons talk to Great Smith!" he cried, "make Indians sick!" And he drew his gun on Ted.
James jumped in front of him and made Ted open the store door. As it swung open, Ted jumped for the needle gun, but it was gone, for James had put it away when he unloaded it.
Five Indians held back. They knew that James worked for the Government. They understood about the pock office and knew that if they killed James or his boy, the soldiers would come after them. They talked excitedly, pointing to Ted, who, now that the gun was gone, stood defiantly watching them.
James began to talk to them in a friendly, reasonable tone, and invited them to come into his house and eat. They complied, but their anger still smoldered, and, shortly after leaving the Davis house, they ambushed a cowboy and a Government scout. There was little security for anyone for some time after that.
One night, Mary, alone at home, suddenly slipped outside and returned with twenty warriors at her heels. She had heard their approach, and, though she was expecting a baby very soon, she had walked down a long, dark bowery to meet them.
"Why you no scared?" the chief asked Mary when they got into the house. "Indians heap mad!"
"Indians return good for good," Mary answered fearlessly.
The answer pleased the Indians. They shook hands with Mary, told her to keep her family inside their own fence for safety, and departed, as quietly as they had come.

Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ Life and Ministry of the Savior (Chapters 11 and 12), by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, March 2, 1948 Objective: To show that Jesus gives ample evidence to all who honestly seek him, that he is the Christ; and that righteousness is the greatest force in the world. WHILE the Lord Jesus was in the wilderness, John the Baptist was continuing the work of his ministry. Strong and mighty in his denunciation of sin and sinners, he was humble and sincere in his attitude He earnestly in the wilderness, way of the Lord" (John 1:23). He spoke of the Savior as the "Lamb of God." "He it is, who me is preferred before me, unloose" (John 1:27)- the sin of the world:" he was to send the Holy host, which John had seen descend master. Great as was to forget self in truly magnifying his Master. One of the truly great lessons of humility and self-effacement was taught by the life of this prophet of God. Many important lessons concerning the Savior can be learned from a careful study of the first chapter of John.: Jesus was now to play the chief role in earth's greatest drama. His method of making friends is intriguing. When two of his early converts, Andrew and John, went to and asked, great deference, they asked, where dwellest thou?" Where does the Lord dwell, and how may we find him? That question wells up in every honest human heart. It is never an intrusion to seek him. Every true teacher must help others to find him. Our missionaries are doing that very thing; so, also, are the members of the great organization of Relief Society. John and Andrew were thrilled with their first meeting with the Lord. The former seemed ever to be his warmest friend, and the latter, immediately, went and brought Simon, later called Peter, and introduced, or presented, him to the  avior. Peter was later  to be made head of the Church. One marvels at the simplicity of true greatness. "Come and see," or "Follow me," was all that was necessary to induce men to give up all and follow him. "Never man spake as he spake." When he summoned, men obeyed. His innate greatness of character appealed to the nobleness in others. Note the conversation with Nathanael: "Whence knowest thou me?" Jesus replied, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee." He knew, too, the man was without guile. Nathanael, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God." In the incident is illustrated the power of penetration possessed by Jesus; also, that clean living�being without guile� brings testimony to the honest seeker. Elder Talmage, the author of the book we are studying, stresses the title, "The Son of Man." A careful study of pages 142 and 143 will be helpful. We shall concern ourselves presently, however, with the beginning of some of the marvelous miracles which were performed for the blessing and benefit of his followers. During one of the Lord's journeys into Galilee, we read of his being present at a marriage party at Cana, near Nazareth (John 2:1-11). Mary, the mother of Jesus, was at the feast and manifested concern because the supply of wine was exhausted. When she came to Jesus about it, he addressed her as "woman." No one doubts that the Lord held his mother in the highest esteem. His filial love for her was worthy and genuine. The salutation "woman" was not in the slightest degree disrespectful. The custom of the day permitted such usage. In one of the most distressing moments of his life, he again addressed his mother as "woman" (John 19:26). In this first miracle of turning water into pure wine, Jesus set his seal of approval upon marriage and also upon proper recreation and social life. He was not opposed to legitimate and wholesome merriment and even celebrations and amusements. We hear much said concerning miracles. Anciently, those who believed and obeyed were promised signs and miracles. What appears to be a miracle may, or may not, be a proof of God's approval. Every true miracle is probably a suspension of natural law, or the operation of higher laws of the universe by God's power. He alone gives the sign, or works the miracle. Anything short of this is not of God. Only those to whom the Holy Ghost is given may know the difference between the genuine and the fraudulent. However, God does not leave us to guess, if truly we seek him. Everywhere in nature we see the operation of laws which we do not understand. They are miraculous to us when we do not understand the power transcending our human knowledge. The nearer we approach the Lord, the more we may understand his ways and works. When a baptized believer is "born of the spirit,� he knows by the assurance which comes to his soul whether a manifestation is from God. The Holy Ghost is the only true guide in such cases. Early Incidents in Our Loid's Public Ministry It was but natural that the Savior's attention would be called early A Perry Picture From a Painting by Hoffmann, 1824-1894 CHRIST DRIVING OUT THE MONEY CHANGERS to conditions at the temple. Prior to his coming, not all of the work now being done in the temples of God was being performed at Jerusalem, but, nevertheless, that temple was considered "the house of the Lord." It was in the temple where the Boy had said, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" Therefore, when the Savior discovered that it was being used as a place for barter and trade, he was righteously angry. Even within the inner precincts, which were supposed to be most sacred, the work of making and changing money and collecting taxes was being carried on. The outer courts and grounds, during the time of the Feast of the Passover, were little more than corrals, pens, and cages for cattle, sheep, and pigeons. Using freely an improvised whip, the Lord drove the traders out, liberated the animals, overturned the tables, and scattered the ill-gotten money on the ground. Before the majesty of the King, the traffickers quailed and slunk back. None dared resist him.
It took the learned time to get their breath before they could weakly ask, "What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
Jesus made a remark that was afterwards used against him: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (John 2:18-19). He referred to his body, but they construed the remark to refer to the temple, which had taken forty-six years in building (John 2:20). Their own words later proved that they knew he referred to his body (Matt. 27:63). The clearing of the temple advertised his work far and wide.
Among the learned who seemed to believe in Jesus, and yet who were afraid to openly espouse his cause, was one, Nicodemus, who occupied an important position among the Jews. This man said to Jesus, "We know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him." In answer, Jesus told him that a man must be born again or he could not see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus marvelled, "How can a man be born when he is old?" Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:3-5). Then, the Master Jesus gave one of his fine lessons. Nicodemus, a learned man, knew that there were other meanings to the word "birth" than a literal, mortal birth. Jesus used an auricular aid: "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit" (John 3:8). Jesus took occasion to explain, in detail, several points of doctrine, in addition to being born of water and of the Spirit. (To get additional light on the full meaning of water baptism and its significance, read Romans 6:3-5).
On the occasion just mentioned, Jesus told Nicodemus:
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16).
Later, the Lord interpreted what he meant by "belief" that saves (John 14:12). LESSON DEPARTMENT This interview furnishes an opportunity for one of the most instructive lessons in the scriptures. Do not pass over it lightly. Faith in Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world can be taught. In the Book of Mormon we tread: And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent (Mosiah 3:17). Salvation comes only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. After one has turned away from evil, one must then have a new birth by being baptized in water. As Paul said: "We are buried with him by baptism unto death." We will walk thereafter in "newness of life." These and other scriptures would be meaningless unless one is immersed in water by one having authority. One further word regarding John the Baptist must be said. The burden of his message was, "Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." He baptized only with water, but always explained that the Greater One would come and baptize with 851 the Holy Ghost. Now that he had come, John withdrew somewhat from the scene, but urged that all good comes from God and not man. It is God, the Holy One, who will "shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore" (Psalms 16:11). Righteousness is the greatest force in the world. Jesus was the most righteous being who ever lived in mortality upon this earth. He is the world's greatest power. Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. The ability to discern the true character of men was shown early in the Lord's ministry. Select and relate a number of incidents which prove this. 2. What evidence have we that Jesus was not opposed to legitimate celebrations and recreations? 3. Relate the incident of the Savior cleansing the temple. Show his courage in the act and his fearlessness in proclaiming his power. 4. What principles of the gospel are taught in the incident of the conversation with Nicodemus? Visiting Teachers: Messages�Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 6�Community Activities President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, March 2, 1948 Objective: To show that present progressive community activities originated and were stimulated by the early pioneers. 852 THE type of settlement adopted by the pioneers was most advantageous for the development of the country and for the well-being of the people, as it made possible the early promotion of joint community activities and interests, which, to the people, were beneficial and helpful. The Latter-day Saint plan of settlement was the farm-village type, with the well-laid-out village as the center, surrounded by farms. The farmers lived together in the village, going out to their farms in the morning and returning in the evening. In the beginning it had been quite necessary for the people to settle together on the streams which furnished the water supply, and, also, for safety from the Indians; but they wisely saw to it that they did not become a mere aggregation of dwellings with no co-operation. Consciously and premeditatively, they organized and developed social units. Rural sociologists in America today recognize the fact that organized rural community living has many advantages over the early American plan of isolated homesteads which had been the rule when land was free or cheap, and unlimited. They also recognize that the Latter-day Saints developed this plan of living to a very high level, perhaps a higher level than most other groups have achieved. A vigorous spirit of co-operation and neighborliness was developed among the pioneer settlers. The people joined together in laying out and planning villages and in developing canals, irrigation ditches, roads, railroads, bridges, sawmills, gristmills, dams, telegraph lines, and in building churches, schools, and homes. They established co-operative stores, newspapers, and periodicals; the first newspaper in Utah was The Deseret News, established in the year 1850. The saints met together frequently as friends and neighbors in the Church, or in the school building, to discuss problems as they arose, and to devise ways and means of making their communities interesting, attractive, and productive. They strove together for economic independence. The Church Welfare Program, today, in its production projects, demonstrates what can be accomplished through co-operation. The pioneer Relief Society women, ever active, alert, and progressive, established, in 1872, a woman's periodical�the Woman's Exponent �at that time the only woman's paper between Boston and the Pacific Coast. 'They also joined together in building women's co-operative stores and Relief Society halls as centers for their activities. In the interest of health, they introduced classes in nursing and obstetrics, and established the first Latter-day Saint hospital�the Deseret Hospital�in 1882. They also encouraged the education of women physicians with the result that a number of Latterday Saint women were graduated from eastern medical schools and were among the first women doctors in the West. These accomplishments set the pattern for present and future activities. Suggestions for Discussion Mention some of the advantages of the farm-village type of settlement. The class leader, by consulting some of the oldest residents in her community, may learn how the pioneers co-operated in the building of canals, irrigation ditches, and other projects. LESSON DEPARTMMENT 853 Work Meeting�Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 5�Bias Cutting and Joining, Cording, and Facing Jean Ridges Jennings Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter VIII For Tuesday, February 10, 1948 IAS strips are commonly used as a finish for suits and dresses, either as a decoration or in a utilitarian capacity. The purpose of this lesson is to suggest ways of using bias for finishing garments and also to give the proper methods of doing so. Three of the most popular edge finishes involving bias strips are: binding, facing, and cording. For any one of the three treatments it is first important and necessary to obtain a true bias strip. If the material is not cut accurately on the true bias grain, the results will be distressing. The material may not lie flat and will launder poorly. The true bias grain is the diagonal of both lengthwise and crosswise grain. To obtain this, bring straight crosswise edge parallel with the lengthwise edge and the resulting fold is the true bias. The diagonal ends of these strips will be on the grain of the material, either lengthwise or crosswise. In joining the bias strips lay the two diagonal ends together, right sides together, and stitch. Then press seams open and flat. Remember that when the strips are laid together for stitching, the points will extend beyond the strip just the width of the seam taken. Always take care to cut and join bias strips accurately. For sheer materials, bindings are always more attractive when made as narrow as possible. They are usually better when applied double. Cut the bias strip six times the width you wish the finished edge to be, fold the binding through the center evenly, with the right side out, and press. Pin the binding to the fabric smoothly with all of the edges even, baste in place, and then stitch on the sewing machine. Bring the folded edge over the seam to the wrong side and hem down by hand, catching the stitches under the machine stitching, being careful not to have them go through to the right side. For heavier fabrics, use a single binding, cutting the bias strips four times the width of the finished binding. Pin, baste, and machine stitch with the two right sides together, having one edge even with the edge of the garment. Turn under the other raw edge once, then turn the folded edge over the seam and stitch A bias facing is made by cutting the bias strip as wide as desired and sewing the edge to be faced in the same manner as the single binding. Press the seam open and flat, then turn bias to the wrong side at the seam edge, being careful that none of the facing shows on the right side. Turn under edge of facing and stitch flat. Blind hem it to the garment. 854 Cording as an edge finish or a trimming is extremely attractive when used at the neckline, on the bottom of sleeves, or to outline any structural detail. Space does not permit a lengthy discussion of uses for cording, but the possibilities are unlimited. (See The Complete Book of Sewing, pages 47, 48, 51, 57, 105, 132.) *To cover a cord, prepare bias strip wide enough to go around the cord and allow for seam. When the bias strip that covers the cord is to be used also as a facing, it should be 1% inches wide, and one edge should be allowed twice as deep as the other. Lay the cord in the fold and stitch close to the cord using machine cording foot. Stitch to edge of garment allowing cord to extend beyond the edge evenly all the way. Blind hem the lower edge of the facing to the garment. Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 6�Visions of the Doctrine and Covenants Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, March 16, 1948 Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the apocalyptic type of literature. A vision of the future, especially the future of what life holds in another world, can bring the brightest hopes of mankind. In our day the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, has blessed us with glimpses of the celestial realm. In company with a companion on each of two occasions, the Prophet saw the throne of God and bore witness of its beauty and joy. Once in the year 1832 with Sidney Rigdon, and again in 1836 with Oliver Cowdery, did he see and make an inspired record of these most soul-searching experiences. So real were the visions that the brightness of detail is not lacking in the words that record the happening: The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened. We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber. His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying: I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father. Behold,. Your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; therefore, lift up your heads and rejoice. Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my people rejoice, who have with their might, built this house to my name. For behold, I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here; and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house. Yea, I will appear unto my servants, and speak unto them with mine own voice, if my people will keep my commandments, and do not pollute this holy house. Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out, and the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house. And the LESSON DEPARTMENT fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this is the beginning of the In the two Prophet Joseph Smith recorded in sections 76 and 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, there may be found new light upon the Savior's Phrase, "In my Father's many mansions." But here are the stirring words of the vis- 10n itself and the manner by which it came into being: the fifth chapter of John, which was given unto us as follows: Speaking of the resurrection of the dead, concerning those who shall hear the voice of the Son of an, and shall come forth�they who have One good in the resurrection of the just, 855 and they who have done evil in the resurrection of the unjust, Now this caused us to marvel, for it was given unto us of the Spirit. And while we meditated upon these things, touched the eyes of our understanding and they were opened and the Lord shone round about. Ping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever. And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, experiences into a realm while we are warned not to delve into the mysteries, yet we all yearn to have the soul comfort such with Proverbs 29:18: "Where there is no vision the people perish:" Activities and Readings for Appreciation In today's discussion period the class might well devote its thinking to the degrees of glory as outlined in the 76 section of the Doctrine and Covenants, This may be found in verses 38 to 119 inclusive. The following verses 50-70 refer to those who will inherit the celestial glory: And again we bear record�for we saw and heard, and this is the testimony of the gospel of Christ concerning them who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just� 856 they are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial, being buried in the water in his name, and this according to the commandment which he has given�that by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power. And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true. They are they who are the church of the Firstborn. They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things�they are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fulness, and of his glory; and are priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son. Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God�wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's and Christ is God's. And they shall overcome all things. Wherefore, let no man glory in man, but rather let him glory in God, who shall subdue all enemies under his feet. These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever. These are they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall come in the clouds of heaven to reign on the earth over his people. These are they who shall have part in the first resurrection. These are they who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just. These are they who are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly place, the holiest of all. These are they who have come to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of Enoch, and of the Firstborn. These are they whose names are written in heaven, where God and Christ are the judge of all. These are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood. These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being typical. For an introduction to these verses, have the class consider the following found in Revelations 14:13: Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. How does the added light, as given through the beautiful passages of the 76 section, bring new meaning to this statement made by John the Divine? What are the lines in this revelation that give poetic hope and joy to those who are faithful? SINCERITY Evelyn Wooster Viner Grieve not for days of autumn, Grieve not for the setting sun, But grieve for tasks unfinished When daylight hours are done. Grieve not for pain and heartbreak, Grieve not for friends untrue, But grieve if you are false To that which dwells in you. LESSON DEPARTMMENT 857 Social Science�Essentials in Home Training Lesson 5�Refinement Elder Joseph Jacobs For Tuesday, March 23, 1948 Objective: To show that refinement enriches one's own life as well as the lives of one's associates, that it embodies all that is gentle, considerate, and uplifting. REFINEMENT includes all that is fine in manners, taste, and feeling, and discards all that is coarse, vulgar, and low. It is a subtle something that one instinctively senses in another, but which is difficult to adequately describe. One who is refined has trained and disciplined his nature over long years, until the fineness of character is deeply ingrained. A person of refinement need not dress expensively nor in style, but must be neat and dressed with a dignity that denotes something money cannot buy. He is gracious to those he contacts. His demeanor sets people at ease and he is conscious of others' well-being rather than his own. Refinement excludes vanity. The truly great are not snobbish, but the would-be great oftentimes are. Illustrating this point, an interesting incident is told by a house guest of Jeritza, the noted soprano: I was staying once with the famous opera singer, Jeritza, in her lovely home in the Tyrol (Austria), when some street singers from Vienna asked to be allowed to come and sing to her. They came and gave us a concert in her garden. It was a picturesque scene, the low white house with green shutters, the blazing garden sleeping in the heat, the vast lake with its ring of majestic mountains. The singers were admirable, but it was the great prima donna's demeanor toward them which made the occasion really memorable to me. She applauded with obvious enjoyment and laughed whole-heartedly at their humor like a joyous school girl. She treated them quite naturally as her equals in the equality of brother and sister artists. She went in and out among them without a shadow of patronage. Afterwards I said to her, "You may be a great singer, but unquestionably you are a greater audience" (ALBERT Victor Balluiz, the Dean of Windsor: The Making of a Man, pp. 57, 58). Our pioneer ancestors were among the truly refined and cultured, and they did not allow the long, arduous trek across the plains to rob them of that refinement. By great effort and inconvenience, they brought with them a few treasured possessions� some good books, a musical instrument, or a choice picture. Flower seeds were carefully tied in a sack and carried with them so that their new homes, no matter how crude or small, could be beautified with the color and loveliness of growing things. Their ideals were high and their attention concentrated on the worthwhile values of life. Food and shelter were not the only things of worth to them. They were not content with mere existence�they desired an abundant life. 'They did everything in their power to improve themselves along cultural lines�in education, music, drama, and art. How Can Refinement Be Made a Part of the Home? Everything in the home may bespeak refinement. It matters not whether the home is costly or has elaborate furnishings. Even modest 858 homes can have a few good pictures which leave a lifelong impression on members of the family, or some good books and periodicals which instill an appreciation for good literature. Good music may be had in every home, if through no other medium than the radio. The selection of the music is what matters. Participation in any of the arts has a refining influence upon one's life. It is possible for one to appreciate the arts merely through observing and listening, but the appreciation will be enhanced if one studies or actually takes part in one of them. Courtesy is one phase of refinement. It is generally agreed that children of the present generation do not manifest the courtesy of former days. In fact, it would appear at times that they take pride in being rude. Whether the cause of this is the modern idea that children should not be inhibited, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that most parents do not teach nor stress nor demand courtesy, as in days gone by. And children do not often, of themselves, pick up those ways. Courtesy is nothing more nor less than consideration for others, or as the oft-repeated phrase says, ""Politeness is to do and say the kindest thing in the kindest way." Many illustrations of the lack of courtesy may be observed. One will serve as an example: a very refined, scholarly young man whom the writer knows, was seen seated near the rear of a bus. At one of the high schools, a large group of noisy boys and girls boarded the already crowded bus, with the result that many of the girls had to stand. The young man, before mentioned, stood up and, in his very precise language, said to a An Ideal Christmas Gift A book of favorite recipes comiled for those who know and love good food by Angie Earl.
