LESSON DEPARTMENT Work Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 7 Buttonholes and Fasteners Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman Objective: To complete the garment, using proper fastenings and buttonholes. Textbook Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter 109. Buttonholes Buttonholes should be one sixteenth to one eighth of an inch longer than the diameter of the button. Ball buttons require a larger buttonhole than flat buttons, to allow for their height or thickness. Determine the proper size by cutting a test buttonhole in a piece of waste fabric. Measure accurately for the placing of buttonholes. Use a ruler, notched cardboard gauge, or mark through the perforation in your pattern. Indicate the position and the length of the buttonhole by a line of running stitches. If the buttonhole is to be made through two or more layers of fabric, baste the layers of fabric firmly together, to hold them in place, before cutting the buttonholes. It is an artistic accomplishment to be able to make perfectly horizontal, tailored, vertical, bound, corded, two-piece, or welt buttonholes. A buttonhole can either add to or detract from the general effect of an article. Snap fasteners, hooks and eyes, zippers, and flat buttons are all used for concealed garment closings. Shank-stem buttons, covered buttons, linked buttons, decorative buttons, tiny buttons, tape and decorative cord fastenings, and plackets, are for practical as well as decorative purposes. The closing of a garment may be concealed or emphasized for decoration, depending upon the type of garment and individual taste. Fasteners In choosing the fasteners, it is just as important to understand the uses of the different kinds of fasteners as it is to know how to put them on. Fasteners should be sewed securely with a heavy cotton thread (unless used on a delicate fabric). For a large button, which will receive hard wear, use linen thread. Never use a rayon or silk thread for buttons, snap fasteners, or hooks and eyes.

Driggs For Tuesday, April 15, 1947 It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall -not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth (Address of President Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, Nov. 19, 1863). "THESE closing lines from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address ring eloquently today as they did during the testing hours of the war between our states. Serious problems then had divided our nation, with each side struggling valiantly for what it felt was right. The issues, bitterly contested in Congress, and among groups of citizens over the land, were not to be resolved through free debate; so war came with all its heartaches, sacrifice, and wounds hard to heal in our national life. Naturally, through the times before, during, and after the war, there was literature of varied types song, oration, story, drama portraying the problems and the spirit of the epoch. Since slavery was at the root of the struggle, much of this literature pictured the negro and the old plantation life. Typical of this expression, from the white folk, are the ever popular songs of Stephen Foster. With a natural gift for creating lyrics and music, this artist has left us a heritage that carries richly through the years. "Old Folks at Home," "Old Black Joe," "Massa's in the Cold Ground," "Oh, Susanna," are typical. All of his songs reveal understanding and appreciation of the folk, white or black, who are pictured. His insight into the varied master and slave relationship is suggested in "My Old Kentucky Home." Its lines make one feel, at first, the happier situation, with the singer voicing joy through these words: The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home; 'Tis summer, the darkies are gay, The corn-top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom, While the
