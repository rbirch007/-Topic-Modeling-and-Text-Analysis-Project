PIONEER WOMEN Olive W. Burt I seek a phrase of sufficient strength And grace and beauty to formulate My concept of those women who Now humbly stand with heroic great  Those women stronger than hills, more tough Than sagebrush permanent in the sand; Persistent as the streams that cut Their clean, deep channels through hostile land. I was not one of these. I was born To streets familiar with poplar trees, To the ordered routine of church and school  The city they built on the desert's knees. But wherever I go among alien folk, I hold my head at a prouder height Because my blood is of their blood, Their vision is my birthright.
