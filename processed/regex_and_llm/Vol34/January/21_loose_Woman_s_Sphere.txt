Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon HIS month marks the beginning of the Centennial celebration of the arrival of the pioneers in Salt Lake Valley. As we unfurl the scroll of history these hundred years have written, we are proud of the quality of womanhood our Church has produced. The typical Mormon woman and she is legion has nobility, kindliness, integrity, intelligence, talent, gentility. And a surpassing faith. IN interesting highlight of the past history of our State was the appointment by Governor Heber M. Wells,, in the year 1900, of a woman as superintendent of public instruction for a period of three months, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Dr. John R. Park. The woman was Mrs. Emma J. McVicker, an instructor at the predecessor of the present Westminister College. She had been nominated for that position in 1895, running against the beloved Dr. Park. However, the supreme court ruled her candidacy illegal. (Women had not yet won suffrage. ) She very graciously withdrew, urging the support of Dr. Park. IN the national news in 1900, was a widow, Mrs. Alice Northlane, of Sioux City, Towa, a cultured gentlewoman and a skilled musician, who won fame and affluence for herself by being one of the best judges of cattle in the United States. She felt that women needed what the New Englanders call "faculty," which she defined as "ability, adaptability, capability." IN the international news in 1900 was Tora, the Japanese wife of Sir Edwin Arnold, one of the most popular hostesses in London. Also, Miss Lillias Hamilton was court physician to the Ameer of Afghanistan. MRS. ANNA CATHERINE PETERSON RASMUSSEN. Of Castle Dale, recently died at the age of 102 years. She was one of those most invaluable Latter-day Saints, a midwife and nurse of the early pioneer days.. She was the oldest woman in Utah. That title now rests with Mrs. Sylvia Elizabeth Metcalf, of Gunnison, 101 years old. She lived through Indian uprisings and learned the Indian language. She has four daughters pining (one died a few weeks ago), 50 grandchildren, 125 great-grandchildren and fourteen great-great-grandchildren. TWELVE nations sent delegates to the board meeting in Brussels of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. Many of them were not permitted by their countries to take out one piece of money, so difficulties were many. Quite a number had been prisoners in concentration camps. Their one great desire is to work for peace.

ONE hundred years ago, Latter-day Saint women and their families were preparing to travel into an unknown land, the wilderness of the great West. The places which were familiar and dear to them had already become part of the past, and most of these women never expected to see their homeland again. They looked towards the prairies that reached to the mountains, and their wagons began the long trek over the emigrant trail, where few women before them had passed.
With the pioneer women, as with us today, only the conditions of the physical world around them were strange, for in their hearts there was a steadfast surety. They possessed that "kingdom of the soul" which could not be altered, and which would never disappear.
Today, our world is strange and unfamiliar around us, and we see much that was good and strong and beautiful being swept away by forces beyond our control. It is a pity that men, formed in the image of God and destined to walk uprightly before him, should feel themselves weak and powerless before mechanical creatures of their own making.
In the presence of this great fear, our thoughts go back to former times, and we must be disturbed to look upon the past, an age of achievement and high endeavor, as a Utopia that cannot return.
And yet our thoughts should not be wholly turned in that direction. We were not made to walk backwards. Our eyes should look towards the future, the new frontier.
Nevertheless, the old solutions are still applicable to our new problems. True Christianity, the true gospel of Jesus, in all its purity and strength, has never yet been lived by any large part of the world at any one time. The practice of this gospel and its extension constitute, for us, the work of the future.
We, as Latter-day Saints, have all the guides for our personal development, and for happiness and accord within the group, which were tested of old�the ancient commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes�all of them implemented and strengthened by the scriptures and teachings given in this day. Thus, although our problems may be strange and threatening, the old answers still apply, the old virtues and the old commandments have never lost their validity. They still stand, and will stand as long as the earth endures�and after.
