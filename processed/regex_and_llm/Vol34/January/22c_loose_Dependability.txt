Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 7 Dependability President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, April 1, 1947 Objective: To understand more completely the great pioneer virtue dependability; to show how the pioneers cherished their honor in their dealings with their fellow men. RELIGION. Which is a mighty force, and helps to bring out the best in man, was uppermost in the minds of the pioneers. It helped to confirm them in their ideal of dependability. It gave them incentive and determination to deal fairly and justly with one another, and with all others, including the traders, the trappers, and the Indians. The whole life and spirit of the pioneer camps, and, later, of the pioneer communities, was conducive to right and proper living. They could be relied upon as individuals and as groups. Their word was as good as their bond. On the 25th of July, 1847, the day after their arrival in the Valley, the following note was made in the diary of a pioneer: The President said he wanted the brethren in overhauling their wagons to return everything that did not belong to them, to the owner, as many things had been changed [exchanged] by the way; even to the value of 6% cents. The diaries of the pioneers reveal the trust and confidence they had in one another and the neighborly spirit of co-operation and generosity which existed. So great was their trust and confidence, that both men and women exchanged labor, service, and equipment, and even made loans of cash without written agreements. In those days, contracts for raising and feeding cattle, for clearing land, and for building homes were often only oral, but they were completed without misunderstandings, because of the honesty and fairness that existed among the people. Women, as well as men, were also generous and trustworthy. One pioneer woman has stated that she nursed a friend on three different occasions when babies were born, and that this friend extended to her the same service. Following, are two excerpts from the journal of a pioneer of 1847. The first refers to the time he was a resident of Perry County, Illinois, and was selling his property there preparing to leave for the West: The next day I went to the home of my brother-in-law to whom I sold some lands left me by my father. He paid me in property, and, on the 29th of January, I let Brother G. P. D., the elder who had converted and baptized me, two yoke of oxen, worth $65.00 each, and two horses, worth $65.00 each; and also $10.00 in cash to enable him to remove his family to the wilderness, he not having means of his own. In the second excerpt, May 28, 1848, at Winter Quarters, the pioneer records further: I got my wagon and equipment I had left with Brother G. A. S. Last fall when I returned from the mountains [Utah]... I let Brother S. Have my ox team put on a plow to break prairie while I was waiting on the ferry, which was very crowded. Dependability, as a trait of character, is as necessary today as it was in the days of the pioneers. In Church work, as in everyday living, the person who can be relied upon, whose word is as good as his bond, will be sought after, and his talents will be called into full and useful endeavor, both for the good of himself and that of others. Anyone who lacks dependability should strive assiduously to cultivate it.
