the new year with hearts filled with faith and courage. Like "Janus of old, we stand with faces turned both ways. We look at the departed year, sorrowful over the unrighteousness that has brought so much anxiety and suffering, but grateful for the fidelity to right and the fortitude that have carried us through. We rejoice that out of the welter of our own personal trials we have been able to rise and serve one another. We look toward the new year, fully aware that it will not let us rest from our labors, neither slacken our watch care over that which is good. We realize, however, that the experiences of the past year have given us increased strength to walk the road ahead; and, through the darkness and despair, we see the light of the gospel burning steady and true. With calm assurance of its unfailing guidance and sustaining power, we accept the tasks that lie ahead and face the future unafraid. Ours is a healing mission requiring the larger heart, the kindlier touch, the steadier will; it is a work of many skills, requiring the alert mind, the measured judgment, the trained hand. Ours is not easy work it was never intended to be so; but it is work, the bountiful fruits of which are joy, satisfaction, and growth. With hearts filled with love and tenderness, with hands held out to service, with minds awake to that which is right, we will work toward nobler modes of life, confident. That a kind and all-wise Father will bless our labors through another year. The love and prayers of the General Board are with our Relief Society sisters throughout the world. May the new year bring to each of us, strength for her tasks, joy in service, and success commensurate with her righteous efforts. Belle S. Spafford Marianne C. Sharp Gertrude R.
