A MOTHER TO HER BABE Roxana Farnsworth Hase 1 cannot feel that I have lived in vain, Nor do I mind the hours of bitter pain Now I behold you, feel you in my arms, And know the lovely beauty that conforms The sweet perfection that is yours today. No matter what may come, years far away, Now you are mine, straight from beauty's realm And I am glad that I am at the helm Of your frail bark to chart your course awhile, To start you on your trip around Time's dial. You are the product of my yesteryears, You hold my ideals, longings, hopes, and fears. I see in you my plan of life fulfilled, I build you castles no one else could build, Then hold you close; all else seems far away  I dream my dreams...for you are mine today. Page 51
