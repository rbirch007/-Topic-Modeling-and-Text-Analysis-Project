LESSON DEPARTMENT 493 Lesson �Introductory Lesson to "Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants" Counselor Marianne C. Sharp For Tuesday, October 7, 1947 Objective: To present a short historical account of the coming forth of the book Doctrine and Covenants, and to call attention to the great work of the Prophet Joseph Smith as a revelator, and the necessity for Latter-day Saints to study the revelations. Historical Account of the Printing of the Doctrine and Covenants THE Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is one of the four standard works of the Church, the other three being the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Pearl of Great Price. The Doctrine and Covenants has been called the scriptures of the dispensation of the fullness of times, and contains ''Revelations Given to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, With some Additions by his Successors in the Presidency of the Church." The first revelation in chronological sequence is section 2 which was given through the Prophet Joseph Smith in Manchester, New - York, September 1823. Section 136 was "given through President Brigham Young, at the. Winter Quarters of the Camp of Israel, Omaha Nation, West Bank of the Missouri River, near Council Bluffs, Iowa, January 14, 1847." 'The revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants were given in preparation for the re-establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ on earth and later for the direction of the Church so organized. The first steps taken in regard to publishing the revelations in book form were taken in 1831. The Prophet Joseph Smith had, by the commandment of the Lord, compiled the revelations for this purpose; and at a conference of the Church held November 1, 1831, the revelation known as the "Preface" was given to be published with the compilation. It was at first decided to publish 10,000 copies of the book, to be known as "The Book of Commandments"; but later this was reduced to 3,000 copies. At another conference, held November 12, 1831, the revelations as prepared were dedicated by prayer and thanksgiving. Elders Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer were appointed to carry the revelations to Missouri for publication and the work was to be done by William W. Phelps & Company. Elder Phelps having been added to the committee with Elders Cowdery and Whitmer, these three were charged with the responsibility of seeing that the printing proceed and be completed at as early a date as possible (D. H. C. 1:270). By the summer of 1833 most of these revelations that had been given up to that time were printed, but before the work was completed the printing plant was destroyed by a mob composed of the enemies of the Church. A few copies of the printed forms were saved and were bound in the "Book of Commandments." 494 A few copies of these revelations thus printed have been preserved. Notwithstanding this calamity, the Church was undaunted in the mission laid upon it to publish the latter-day revelations of God to mankind. The first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants was published in Kirtland in 1835. On the title page the statement is made that the contents were compiled by "Joseph Smith, Junior; Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams, Presiding Elders of the Church." The book was printed by Frederick G. Williams & Company, in Kirtland. On September 24, 1834, at a meeting of the High Council in Kirtland, Ohio, a committee, with Joseph Smith, the Prophet and President of the Church, at its head, was constituted to publish the revelations and other matter relating to the doctrines of the Church. This committee reported the completion of its labors to a general assembly of the Church, at Kirtland, August 17, 1835. The congregation was seated in the order of solemn assembly �each quorum or distinctive body of the Priesthood being in its place�and the acceptance of the revelations contained in the book of Doctrine and Covenants was expressed by the separate vote of each quorum, and then by the united vote of the entire assembly. The testimony of the Twelve Apostles of the Church was formulated, signed, and presented to the assembly in the form following: TESTIMONY OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES TO THE TRUTH OF THE BOOK OF DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS The Testimony of the Witnesses to the Book of the Lord's Commandments, which commandments He gave to His Church through Joseph Smith, Jun., who was appointed by the voice of the Church for this purpose: We, therefore, feel willing to bear testimony to all the world of mankind, to every creature upon the face of all the earth, that the Lord has borne record to our souls, through the Holy Ghost shed forth upon us, that these commandments were given by inspiration of God, and are profitable for all men and are verily true. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JULY 1947 We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord being our helper; and it is through the grace of God the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, that we are permitted to have this privilege of bearing this testimony unto the world, in the which we rejoice exceedingly, praying the Lord always that the children of men may be profited thereby.. Thomas B. Marsh David W. Patten Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Orson Hyde Wm. E. McLellin Parley P. Pratt Luke S. Johnson William Smith Orson Pratt John F. Boynton Lyman E, Johnson In successive editions of the Doctrine and Covenants, additional revelations or other matters of record have been added, as received, and as accepted by competent assemblies or conferences of the Church. � Certain lessons, entitled ''Lectures on Faith," which were bound in with the Doctrine and Covenants in some of its former issues, are not included in this edition. Those lessons were prepared for use in the School of the Elders, conducted in Kirtland, Ohio, during the winter of 1834- 1835; but they were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons ("Explanatory Introduction to the Doctrine and Covenants," page v). The Doctrine and Covenants has been translated into the following languages: Danish, Welsh, German, Swedish, Dutch, Hawaiian, and Maori (Essentials in Church History, page 684). At the present time (1947) many of these translations are being revised to keep pace LESSON DEPARTMENT with the modern language changes, and a complete translation is being made in Spanish and Portuguese (See "Church Section," The Deseret News, May 3, 1947, pp. 4, 12). Prophet Joseph Smith as a Revelator Section 135 of the Doctrine and Covenants relates the martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother Hyrum Smith the Patriarch, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844. It speaks of the great work which the Prophet Joseph did for mankind, stating that: Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. Among the Prophet's marvelous accomplishments is mentioned that he "has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants" (135:3). The study of the course "Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants," which will comprise the seven remaining Relief Society lessons in literature for 1947-48, will call forcibly to the attention of Relief Society sisters the incalculable service performed for Latter-day Saints by the Prophet Joseph Smith in being the worthy instrument in the hand of the Lord through whom the Lord in this day revealed his mind and will to mankind. Among other expressions, the following ones are typical of those used by the Prophet Joseph Smith before copying revelations into his history of the Church: The following I applied for and obtained, at the request of... (D. H. C. 1:28); I 5 inquired of the Lord through the Urim and Thummim, and obtained the following... (Ibid., page 33); In this manner did the Lord continue to give us instructions from time to time, concerning the duties which now devolved upon us; and among many other things of the kind, we obtained of Him the following, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation... (Ibid., page 64); I inquired of the Lord and received the following important revelation... (Ibid., page 229). Elder Parley P. Pratt has left an interesting account of the manner in which the Prophet Joseph dictated a revelation: Each sentence was uttered slowly and very distinctly, and with a pause between each, sufficiently long for it to be recorded by an ordinary writer in long hand. This was the manner in which all his written revelations were dictated and written. There was never any hesitation, reviewing, or reading back, in order to keep the run of the subject; neither did any of these communications undergo revisions, interlinings or corrections. As he dictated them so they stood, so far as I have witnessed; and I was present to witness the dictation of several communications of several pages each. The footnote adds: This statement of Elder Pratt's is true in a general way, and valuable as a description of the manner in which revelations were dictated by the Prophet; and needs modifying only to the extent of �saying that some of the early revelations first published in the "Book of Commandments," in 1833, were revised by the Prophet himself in the way of correcting errors made by the scribes and publishers; and some additional clauses were inserted to throw increased light upon the subjects treated in the revelations, and paragraphs added, to make the principles or instructions apply to officers not in the Church at the time some of the earlier revelations were given. The addition of verses 65, 66 and 67 in section of the Doctrine and Covenants, is an example (D. H. C. 1:173, footnote). 496 There were certain acquaintances of the Prophet who found fault with him as a revelator. At one time Oliver Cowdery wrote that he had discovered an error in one of the commandments. 'The Prophet relates: I immediately wrote to him in reply, in which I asked him by what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from Almighty God (D. H. C. 1:105). At another time the Prophet tells how a certain man:... As the wisest man, in his own estimation, having more learning than sense, endeavored to write a commandment like unto one of the least of the Lord's, but failed; it was an awful responsibility to write in the name of the Lord. The Elders and all present that witnessed this vain attempt of a man to imitate the language of Jesus Christ, renewed their faith in the fulness of the Gospel, and in the truth of the commandments and revelations which the Lord had given to the Church through my instrumentality (D. H. C. 1:226). The importance which the Prophet Joseph Smith himself attached to the revelations he received from God. Is shown by the following statement he wrote in 1831:.. In consequence of the book of revelations, now to be printed, being the foundation of the Church in these last days, and a benefit to the world, showing RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JULY 1947 that the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom of our Savior are again entrusted to man; and the riches of eternity within the compass of those who are willing to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God�therefore the conference voted that they prize the revelations to be worth to the Church the riches of the whole earth, speaking temporally (D. H. C. 19235). Necessity for Studying the Doctrine and Covenants Throughout the literature course to follow, Relief Society members would do well to bear in mind the following words of the Lord so that each class member may seek earnestly and prayerfully to learn for herself the truthfulness of the Doctrine and Covenants while she deepens her appreciation of the beauty of the language in which the revelations are expressed: Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same (D. & C. 1:37). Activities for Discussion Have the class members recall or recite sections or parts of sections in the Doctrine and Covenants with which they are especially familiar. > Work Meeting�Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) The preview and the first optional lesson for use at the work meeting will appear in the August Magazine. LESSON DEPARTMENT 497 Social Science- Essentials in Home Training Elder Joseph Jacobs Preview of Lessons for 1947-48 HE course of study for the social science department for the coming season (1947-48) is titled "Essentials in Home Training," and is a continuation of last year's course "The Family in the Gospel Plan." Last year's course dealt with organization of the family, its practical workings, the responsibilities of each member of the family, and some phases of training which should be incorporated into children's lives. This year we take up a study of fundamental qualities of character which are basic to righteous living and consider how to implant them in members of the family. These lessons have been chosen with the thought in mind that the family is the most important unit that exists, and that the foundation for a righteous life must be laid in the home. The home is directly responsible for the ideals and standards of conduct developed by the individual. ' The important part that the example of parents plays in instilling these qualities in children is stressed. We refer class leaders to the treatment of some of these subjects as discussed by Dr. Harold T. Christensen in the social science lessons for the seasons 1944-45 and 1945-46. While the viewpoint on these subjects is different, much help may be derived from a study of his lessons in relation to the various subjects. Particular emphasis in this year's course is placed on giving practical help in applying these qualities to child training. Since the possession of these attributes is essential to a living of the gospel, repeated discussion will lead to better living. We are making a slight change in the arrangement of questions for these lessons. Instead of putting them at the end of each lesson, we are insertings them at appropriate places throughout, where discussion will be profitable. We realize, of course, that most teachers use this procedure already, but for the new or inexperienced teacher it may be helpful. When the lesson is given in its entirety with questions and discussion left until last, too often the time may be short or class members may have forgotten what they had wished to contribute. Teachers should take care to keep the discussion within a proper allotment of time for each topic. Again we say, the success of these lessons depends largely on the contribution of class members and the stimulation given for personal application. The experiences of mothers whose children are already reared is invaluable to younger ones whose children are still small, and whose methods of training may be at times experimental. The titles and objectives of the lessons for this year follow: Lesson 1. Obedience Objective: To show that obedience is the way to happiness, and to discuss methods of teaching obedience in the home. 498 Lesson 2. Honesty Objective: To show that honesty is fundamental to an upright character, and that teaching of this principle and a consistent example set by daily living must be given children in the home. Lesson 3. Chastity Objective: To show the necessity of living a chaste life, and to give suggestions for proper training in the home which will fortify members of the family to lead such a life. Lesson 4. Observance of the Sabbath Day Objective: To show that the command regarding Sabbath day observance is just as binding on us now as it has ever been, and that through training and the formation of proper habits in the home RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JULY 1947 the Sabbath will be spent worshipfully and the attendant blessings received. Lesson 5. Refinement Objective: To show that refinement enriches one's own life as well as the lives of one's associates, that it embodies all that is gentle, considerate, and uplifting. Lesson 6. Tolerance Objective: To show that the teachings of the Lord breathe the spirit of tolerance, and that tolerance is not acceptance. Lesson 7. Reverence Objective: To show that reverence is inborn, that it has been observed from the beginning of time, and that it needs greater emphasis in our lives today. Lesson!|�Obedience Elder Joseph Jacobs For Tuesday, October 28, 1947 Objective: To show that obedience is the way to happiness, and to discuss methods of teaching obedience in the home. How Important Is the Principle of Obedience? BEDIENCE is one of the great principles of life, for through it we gain salvation and exaltation. It is an eternal principle�one which will never change nor become obsolete. In the universe surrounding us we see the operation of obedience to law in every detail�in the invariable course of the sun, the changing of the seasons, the migration of birds, the growth of seeds. Obedience also operates in all human activity. Whether it be in the field of science, business, or agriculture, certain laws must be adhered to if success is to result. Do you wish to raise a flower garden? Then you must follow the laws of nature which outline the proper cultivation of plants. Do you wish to become a nurse? Then you must obey the law which says you are to pursue its study until you are eligible for graduation. Governmental affairs, as well, are based upon obedience to law. The laws themselves are mere words in the statute books, having no meaning whatever, unless they are put into action by men. "ug. Do you wish to gain salvation? Then you must render obedience to the requirements prescribed by our Heavenly Father which will lead you there. The battle of life is essentially a battle between obedience or disobedience to eternal law; between good and evil; between right and wrong (JOHN A.: Evidences and Reconciliations, page 267). LESSON DEPARTMENT What Is the Price of Transgression? Transgression of the law is primarily or indirectly the cause of all suffering (JAMES E. Talmage: The Vitality of Mormonism, page 388). We read in Hebrews 5:8: "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered," showing that through our Savior's suffering he learned obedience. The important point for us to remember is that digressing from the course of obedience is like getting off on a detour and, eventually, having to work our way back to the main highway in order to continue onward. The sooner we learn to obey righteous laws, the easier it will be for us to obtain the prize we desire. Disobedience sooner or later brings suffering. Does Obedience Curtail One's Liberty? It is an erroneous idea which suggests that obedience takes away one's liberty. We read: Here is a brother who says, "I do not want to be dictated; I want to preserve my freedom; I do not want to be a slave" What an idea! It is from the enemy, and because a person has not the Spirit of the Lord to see how things are. There is not a man of us but what is willing to acknowledge at once that God demands strict obedience to his requirements. But in rendering that strict obedience, are we made slaves? No, it is the only way on the face of the earth for you and me to become free, and we shall become slaves to our own passions, and of the wicked one,.. If we take any other course.... Now to say that I do not enjoy the volition of my own will just as much when I pray as I would to swear, is a false principle.... (Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 347- 348; 1941 edition, page 225). "Obedience to righteous law is the price of liberty. In such obedience 499 lies happiness," (James E. TalMAGE: The Vitality of Mormonism, page 338). "By his own acts man may win blessings or bring condemnation upon himself' (Joun A. Widstoe: Evidences and Reconciliations, page 267)...� It is a regrettable fact that people, generally, will obey laws when the penalties for disobedience are immediate or apparent, but will postpone obeying or entirely disregard those laws whose penalties are not so immediate nor apparent. They are slow to learn that disobedience to these laws is as certain to bring its result as disobedience to any other law. People accept the fact, for example, that adding anti-freeze to water reduces the freezing point, and that anti-freeze must be added to prevent damage to automobile radiators during cold weather. They obey, without question, the physical law, by having a vaccination which renders the body immune to smallpox, because they have heard of the effects of that terrible disease. But they disregard or put off the law of tithing or the law of baptism or temple work, because no immediate penalty is apparent. Is There a Lack of Control in the Home Today? The home is the strategic place in which to instil sterling qualities of character. There, the lasting foundation is laid and habits of right living cultivated. There, also, fathers and mothers train themselves to be exemplary before their children: If life could be lived with no laws, we could do away with obedience in the home.... But laws must be obeyed so that life for all will be happier and better. When 500 we dispense with control in the home we have at once handicapped a child for his later contacts with a life which is full of laws. He will learn with more sorrow and difficulty when he is grown. The child who has learned obedience to reasonable laws will be best 'equipped to establish a home of his own..... Marriage and home life require forbearance, mutual respect and obedience to certain laws. Some sort of control in the training of young people must prepare them for this. Ideas of control have undergone a vast change in the last seventy years. The father in the pioneer family might be said to have been next to God. His word was law in the family and he did not hesitate to enforce obedience by corporal punishment. In the old days discipline was often misused... But we now have the ludicrous example of parents who never say "No" to their children (American Association of School Administrators: Education for Family Life, pp. 66, 67). Edgar James Swift, in his book The Psychology of Childhood, says, on page 284: The defense mechanism of adults is working overtime today. They try to hide. Their own incompetence by excuses. "Children are not the same as when we were young," they say. As a matter of fact, however, human nature does not change so quickly. The difference today is in the greater opportunity for getting into trouble and in the perplexity of parents. Parents themselves have more demands upon their time.... The call of the automobile and of the various entertainments is as insistent for parents as for the children. Consequently, for all except the more thoughtful, there is less time to plan for the training and development of children in the home. How May We as Parents Best Teach Obedience in the Home? First, by example. Obedience is the very first principle a child should learn and it is taught most effectively by the example of the parents. It has been said, "Example is the greatest character builder." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JULY 1947 No parent should expect a child to obey any principle unless he himself complies. [Some] children expect to obey until they find that they do not have to do so. They are always trying out their parents to see how far they can go, and if given a little leeway, they invariably accept it and try to push on a little farther.... Children are a good deal like the lower animals. They expect at the beginning to recognize authority but when they find that the authority does not restrain they use their freedom to the limit. A horse, for example, when once allowed to run away is never wholly safe (EDGAR JAMES Swirt: The Psychology of Childhood, page 285). As Latter-day Saints we believe in obedience to the laws of the land. We read in the 134th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside... And that to the laws all men owe respect and deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror (D. & C., 134-5, 6). Our 12th Article of Faith states: We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. The surest way to engender disrespect for law among the young is for the grownups to wink at minor infractions of the law or to break a law and justify themselves blandly with the statement that it is either an unjust or unnecessary law. But if the law is scrupulously obeyed and respected in the home, those same ideals will reflect in the lives of the children. Name an orderly society, name an orderly government, name an orderly home, LESSON DEPARTMENT and there you will find obedience to correct principles reigning supreme. Second, we may teach obedience in the home by wise methods of discipline. Up to about six years of age discipline to a large extent should be training in habits of obedience (Edgar JAMES Swirt: The Psychology of Childhood, page 287). But a child should not be given unnecessary commands. If a parent is everlastingly saying, "Don't do this and don't do that," the child is apt to pay very little attention. A request or command should not be retracted nor forgotten, but should be followed to completion. 'The child must know that excuses and dillydallying will get him nowhere. After a child passes the sixth year his reasoning powers develop more rapidly, and when he begins asking why he must do certain things, he should be given as good a reason as he is capable of understanding. Do not say, "Do this because I say so," but rather, "Do this because it is right," then explain wherein it is right. Children instinctively like and want to obey, but they rebel at being forced to do things. If they were forced even to play ball the game would be as loathsome as any other imposed task. So it is a great principle to make as much fun out of work as possible. "Let's pretend," is a good slogan. A boy who plays that the lawn mower is a tractor and he is cultivating his field of sugar beets, is not only mowing the lawn, he is making fun out of it as well. While this is a fine thing, a child must also realize that work, hard work, is a necessary part of life and 501 that satisfaction may be gained by doing work well. It has always been easier to forbid children to do undesirable things and then to punish them if they disobey than to create conditions which shall preserve discipline without punishment (Edgar JAMEs Swirt: The Phychology of Childhood, page 285). Angelo Patri once said, "Make it easy for children to obey." There are simple procedures which will help to prevent disobedience and make for harmony in the home. For instance, instead of letting John and Tommy quarrel over the use of the bicycle, bring out the clock and allow each child an equal period of time in which to ride. If candy or any other goody is to be apportioned, make a standing rule that one child may divide the treat and the other take his choice of the two divisions. This arrangement is foolproof and any child will recognize it as fair. To go out and tell children that in fifteen minutes or at the end of the present game they are to come in to dinner or go on an errand, is far better than to expect them to immediately break away from an intriguing game of play. When you find a child with something he must not play with, either because it is fragile or dangerous, substitute another toy before taking the first one away, then his interest will have a focus before he has time to feel resentment or to rebel. For members of the family to do things together makes the work much more pleasant. Contests relative to the work are sometimes helpful. Be cheerful when asking a child to do his work. Don't tell him in the spirit of driving. Let him know that you expect the finest type of 502 conduct from him. Family pride encourages a child to do his best and to conform to family standards. Show a child that you have confidence and trust in his integrity. Obedience should receive its due compensation. A pat on the back, a smile or word of praise will show appreciation for good conduct. Emphasizing the good will naturally tend to direct a child's thoughts. In the right channels. Natural punishments are the best form of discipline. A boy who fails to do his daily chores later wants to play football. The mother is sorry for there is no reason in the world why he should not play football except that he neglected to do his work. It is just one of those unfortunate laws of nature.... If we do things when they should be done, pleasures are in order, but if we fail to do them the penalty is inevitable.... It is one of the laws, for the violation of which we must suffer (Edgar James Swirt: The Psychology of childhood, page 289). RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JULY 1947 In explaining obedience to adolescents, teach them that all the blessings of life come through obedience to law. Obedience based on full confidence and trust in the words and promises of the Lord should be the directing influence. Similarly, the child's faith and confidence in his parents should increase. It may be accomplished by being absolutely truthful, dependable to promises given, and thoroughly consistent in all dealings. The Lord has given us, in the Doctrine and Covenants, the reason why we should be obedient: There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated�And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated (130:20-21). And, again, from the Doctrine and Covenants: I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise (82:10). Additional References Dr. Harold T.

Suddenly Gramp's blue eyelids fluttered open and he looked up into her troubled face. "Now, now, Judy," he said, his voice coming as if from a great distance, "don't look that-a-way. I'm all right. I'm fine." Judith looked at him mutely, tears rolling unheeded down her cheeks. "Know what?" Gramp resumed presently, his voice weak but his eyes bright and clear, "I think I'm goin' to get to go at last! I b'leeve they're comin' for me from "T'other side!' Now, wait!" His weak fingers restrained Judith when she would have risen. "Don't go callin' the neighbors. They can help ye when I'm gone. Jes' stay here and wait with me till they come for me." He paused for breath, and Judith sat quietly holding his hand, his serenity and quiet happiness unconsciously affecting her own spirit. "Sam'll be here," Gramp_ whispered presently, "mebbe you won't see him, Judy, but he'll see you and the little ones. Ill tell him you been a good daughter, Judy. I'll tell him�" It was increasingly difficult for Judith to hear him and she bent closer for his feeble whisper, "I'll tell him I left ye in good hands. Young Bill' ll take care of ye, Judy. Sam'll understand. Sam!" Judith was sure the last word was not the beginning of a never-to-be finished sentence, but a greeting instead! It was an exclamation, and Gramp's voice had strengthened and risen in an inflection of pure joy. Judith sat on for a moment, sensing, as Gramp must often have done, the mystery and nearness of his longed for "Other Side," almost with the feeling of one who has waved farewell to a joyous traveler, rather than looked upon death. Then she gently disengaged her hand and pulled up the sheet over the peaceful old face. She glanced at the clock which had counted out so many fateful moments of her life. Tt was exactly four o'clock�twenty-four hours since she had slipped out so quietly in the dawn. "What a day!" she murmured softly, smiling tenderly through her tears, "but what a wonderful day for Gramp!" Westward In 47 It's new and different!
