CHAPTER 6
[The incidents of this story are true, and the characters authentic. The information has been carefully gleaned from diaries, journals, and personal interviews.�Ed.]
Synopsis: A company of twenty-four young men and two families�James L. Davis, his wife Mary, and their four children, Henry H. Harriman, his wife Elizabeth, and their five children�are called to explore a route from Cedar City, in Southern Utah, to San Juan County. The two families are to remain in San Juan and, at a point where the Montezuma Creek comes into the San Juan River, are to establish an outpost and prepare for the coming of the main company of settlers, members of the San Juan Mission. The twenty-four scouts are to return to their homes and report their findings. The purpose of the mission is to cultivate and maintain peaceful and friendly relations with the Indians, who are almost the sole occupants of the large isolated county.
While driving her team at night, across a gulley, menacing desert, Elizabeth has a frightening experience with a mysterious Indian. She feels that she will see the Indian again and that he will know if she needs help. The company travels over rough and dangerous country and after much suffering, finally reaches Moenkopi, an Indian outpost and a supply point for traders and pioneers. The Davis family remains at Moenkopi and the others go on toward the San Juan. The white man's "water magic," in the form of a move well digging, saves the lives of the company. Moving steadily onward, building their road as they go, the company halts while scouts explore for water, and a way out of a box canyon. The scouts, almost unconscious from thirst, get back to camp and report that there is no water. A strange, long-drawn-out warning, and misgiving.
THE long night hours wore on. Restless and feverish, the suffering company saw the sun come up, and prayed for respite.
Bad as the night had been, with its cold stars and its dry winds, it was preferable to the glare of the sun and the blistering sand that freighted the air. The guards came down from the lookout points and new ones took their places, to scan the horizon for a sight of the other water scouts, now long overdue.
What was the strange, long call they had heard from the ledge the night before? Was it human? No one could say. And all that the guards knew was that it seemed to come from a crevice in the rocks, near where they stood. Yet they had seen no one. There had been a quality to the call that made it seem to come from a long way off, yet everyone in camp was convinced that it came from someone�or something�near. The uncertainty of it increased the tension that gripped the company, and made fear thirst and inactivity harder to bear.
What had happened to the water scouts? Did the strange long call have anything to do with them? Do the minds of the leaders, it was unthinkable to move far in any direction without a report from the water scouts that water was to be found, for, without water, the company would surely die. The exertion of travel would exhaust what little reserve strength the teams and stock had, and gain nothing. There was no alternative but to wait for the scouts.
"Can you see the water scouts, Henry?" Elizabeth asked. "Surely, surely we have not come this far only to fail in our mission. This is a lonely place to die."
"I can see nothing but heat waves," Henry answered. "And I can hear nothing but the wailing of the squaws and their papooses."
"If the scouts had found water they would have come back to tell us," Elizabeth decided. "They'd have been back long ago."
"Look, Elizabeth!" Henry pointed to the sounds that were just going on duty. "They are signalling something to the camp! It's the water scouts!" he cried, and ran toward the two human figures that had staggered over a knoll, not far from the camp.
The guards began firing their guns�three salutes�the signal that the scouts are in.
A shout went up. "The scouts are in! The scouts are in!"
But the scouts had sunk to their knees. They were crawling, and falling by turns toward the camp.
"They have not found water!" Elizabeth sobbed, and she began to pray. Her arms went out to her children, holding them in a sadly frightened little group, against her skirts. "Oh, heaven help us!" she prayed. "What will become of us now!"
The men raced toward the knoll where the scouts had fallen. Strong arms lifted them and carried them to the camp. And she, the only woman, could not cry out. Yet she could not bear the agonizing conviction that the scouts had died.
"Darlings, be quiet," she hushed her children. "Wait with mother. When your father comes, then we will pray."
It was she, the woman, who sparingly bathed the faces and parched lips of the water scouts. She who put clean shirts on their bodies and shaded their eyes from the sun. It was she, the woman, who waited while the leaders of the company talked and pounded tones, weighing the report of the thirsty scouts.
"No water � none anywhere. Three days travel�you will not find any water," they had gasped.
"No water, no water. . ." The words were burned into their eyes, and they kept repeating it.
"We cannot live three days longer," Elizabeth said to herself again and again, as she worked over the scouts. "We cannot travel, and we are dying here." But to the scouts she kept repeating that President Smith and her brother would find a way to save the company and the mission. And as she repeated the words, they took on meaning for herself, as well as for the water scouts.
"There is no way, Lord," she prayed. "No way except it be a miracle. Let the Indians' prayers be heard, too, Lord, we are all thy children."
FOR days the Indians had sent up prayers to their rain-gods, had sung and danced for the rain to come. But often their praying and dancing had been interrupted by imprecations against the white men, whom they held responsible for their suffering. It was the white men who had made the rain-gods angry. It was the white man, the palefaces, who should be punished.
"This is a desperate situation, George," Silas murmured. "We have got to try digging for water again, though it may cost us our lives. The Indians are in no mood to see us fail."
"We're dying of thirst as it is," George answered. "I've been thinking about a conversation I overheard yesterday. It was about a lost spring. Peogament has been hunting furiously for it for two days. He says his forefathers told him it was here." George paused and a sort of a desperate grin came over his face. "And you know, Silas, that forefathers do not lie. Peogament says the raingods took the spring away because he was angry with his people, the red men. He says the raingods are angry now, angry because the Indians are letting white men come into Indian country. He will not show him, the great Peogament, where the lost spring is."
"Let's start digging, George. Anywhere, just to dig. The other water scouts may come in with a favorable report from the direction they have explored. The digging will pacify Peogament until we hear from the scouts."
"Where shall we start?" George asked, more to encourage thinking than because he expected an answer.
"Let's try H�let's see." His eyes ranged over the ground around the camp. "Let's try digging between those two big lava rocks. The sand around there is coarse and whiter than it is anywhere else. Funny I didn't notice that before!"
"You don't suppose�" Silas began, and then he stopped abruptly. "It seems to me that I've seen that spot a hundred times without noticing that the sand and softer
even polished! I don't usually dig wells by hunches, but this one is good to be. It's the most unlikely place to dig a well, but�call the well diggers!" Silas cried. "We'll make these wailing Piutes shut up or dance at our funeral."
The diggers went to work, but without any enthusiasm. Hobbs watched the upthrown sand. "Dig close to the rocks, fellows," he suggested.
"Would through them do just as well?" one of the diggers grumbled, showing his disgust by trying to split the rock with the blade of his shovel. "There you are!" he sneered. "A nice deep well of clear, cold water!"
"You're a right to be irritable, fellow," George replied. "I guess that's the way we all feel. But, just to humor me, dig under the rocks; then you can dig through them."
Fed to the point of good nature, the Indians had left off their wailing and had come to watch the well digging�always a point of fascinating interest for them. They laughed and pointed their fingers at the well diggers and pushed the dirt back into the hole with their scuffling feet.
Suddenly George leaned forward. The hole was about five feet deep. "Dig to the right!" he cried. "Dig fast! Silas, wave your arms above this rock. Do something to frighten the Indians. Do it, man! Hurry! Do something that will impress these redskins."
Silas looked at George with quick comprehension. He raised his arms above his head, solemnly faced the Indians, and began to pray. Not just to impress the Indians, but from a 472 miracle of water gushed forth... Lost Spring was found again! THAT night Elizabeth and Henry sat a long while before their campfire, listening to the singing and chanting in the camp of the Indians not far away. "It's a strange way to give thanks," Elizabeth said. "It's a heathen sound, but it is music to my ears." "The finding of the spring was a miracle, Bethy." Henry looked into the fire, searching for words with which to express himself. "It couldn't just have been an _accidental thing." "Oh, of course it is a miracle, Hen-!" Elizabeth exclaimed, "I wish that Mary had been here to witness it. When will the Davis family join us, Henry?" "Possibly not until after we reach San Juan. But that will not be long now, and scouts have already been chosen to go back for them." "I wonder if Mary is well," Elizabeth mused. "That is another blessing, Bethy. Mrs. Davis has improved in health ever since she undertook this trip. People said she would die on the way, and reproached James for accepting the call." "Yes, even her brother told James that he was an inconsiderate fanatic" "James Davis is a good man, Bethy. I'd not ask for a better." "Nor a finer woman than Mary," Elizabeth added. "I can hardly wait to see her and the children. Their new baby will be born almost as soon as they reach San Juan." "Don't expect them too soon, Elizabeth," Henry cautioned. "It's a long way back, over the roughest country out of doors. And traveling with the stock will be slow. But I pray they reach San Juan in time for the coming of the baby." "Henry," Elizabeth � stopped thoughtfully, then continued, trying to phrase her thoughts. "Henry, when I think of a big company coming to San Juan the way we have, it frightens me. We have had enough trouble, but a big company would have more." "Yes, that may be so, Elizabeth. They will have to start in the fall or there will not be any water. And fall is pretty close to winter. I'd hate to try crossing a country like this in a snowstorm. Landmarks are hard to find and harder to follow. I never saw such a maze of canyons in my life. It takes more than human wisdom to find such a way." "Yes. Just as it took more than human wisdom to find Lost Spring. I'll never get over the way the Indians looked at President Smith and George when the water gushed forth." "It was pretty wonderful for all of us. As if Moses had again struck the rock," Henry answered. "Henry," Elizabeth hesitated, then went on in a determined voice, "I felt rebellious about coming away out here. We had just got things fixed so nice at home. But when I saw that water gush forth from Lost Spring, my heart seemed to burst with gratitude that we had been chosen to receive such blessings." "You are a good wife, Bethy." Henry smiled fondly. "And you are a good woman to have in such a company as this." Elizabeth sighed happily. "I guess it is time that all good people were asleep," she laughed. "We have WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT stayed up as late as if we were courting!" Gea stood up, and, reaching for her hands, helped Elizabeth to her feet. They stood there a moment, then said goodnight, she to go to bed in her wagon with the children, and he to take his turn as night guard. THE first, long, tinted rays of the sun fell upon the gushing clear cold water of Lost Spring. All night the Indians had chanted and danced, and now they lay asleep, sunlight streaming over their faces. Again they were at peace with their white brothers. With the first stir in camp, Elizabeth took her five children to stand by the water of the spring and dip their fingers into it. "This gleaming, silver water is Lost Spring," she said. "You will never see anything more precious than this water. God gave it to us, his servants, as surely as he leads us where we are to go, if we follow his commandments. Never doubt the miracle of Lost Spring." The children clung to each other and to their mother, almost in tears at the solemnity of her voice. "Will it ever get lost again, Mother," the oldest child asked, "or will Heavenly Father leave it here for the Indians?" "I think it will be here for a long time to come," Elizabeth answered. "And we must never forget that our lives were saved by the miracle of its waters." "I don't want to go away and leave this good spring, Mother," one of the smaller ones said. "Most of the water we have had tasted like medicine," Elizabeth smiled. "And neither 473 do I, my dears. But since we can't take it with us, we will fill every jug and barrel we have with this good water and take them along with us. And maybe it will be enough to last until we reach San Juan." Elizabeth stood silent for a time, weighing her own words. Until we reach San Juan. Her mind was traveling miles ahead. Would there be water and food and schools in the new country? Would she and Mary be equal to the task of shaping their children's lives to good and civil ways in such a wilderness, so far from other human habitation? Would Fort Montezuma be a haven or only just an outpost where all trails would run out, leaving want, desolation, and fear? THE morning after the finding of Lost Spring, Silas Smith climbed a point three or four miles from the camp to look the country over and see which general direction it would be best to take. In the distance he saw two figures dragging along toward the camp. He surmised that they were the two other water scouts, and he was so filled with relief that they were safe that he fired his gun in the salute that had been agreed upon, even though he knew the volley would not be heard by his friends in the camp. The scouts, Kumen Jones and Seth Tanner, had been all the way to the San Juan River. They had not had the hardships the other two scouts had experienced, because they had found people on the river, Clara Mitchell and her husband and two trappers who lived with them. These people had fed the scouts and had treated them well. The scouts handed over a map of a 474 route for the company they had made, and, on May 29, 1879, the company broke camp, on the last lap to the San Juan. The sand was heavy and travel was slow. Often they made no more than eight miles in a day. The last day they made fifteen miles, and camped at a place which the Mitchells had named Alkali Gulch. That night the stock was driven three miles to the river, and held there by the drovers. On the first of June, the San Juan Mission Exploring Company reached its destination on the San Juan River, near where Montezuma Creek empties into it. After the heat and the sand of the desert it was like being in a new world to see green trees, clear water, and abundant feed for stock. Men scrambled from their wagons and waded into the river, shouting and flailing their arms about in their exuberance. They went fishing, and one man caught a_ twenty-pound salmon. It was a gala day, and not a man in the company would do any worrying for that night at least. But with Elizabeth, it was different. She, alone in all the miles of country that surrounded her, sat motionless in her wagon. "It is the end of the earth," she said. "This is where trails run out." She bowed her head and wept from sheer loneliness and disappointment. "Oh, Mary," she sobbed, "don't, don't come!" "Bethy," Henry's arms went awkwardly about her. "Don't cry, my girl. It isn't so bad. The land is good. See how green the trees are!" "And where will we get water for our crops?" "Why, from the San Juan, of course," Henry replied stoutly, astonished that she would ask the question when they were sitting on the banks of a river that was wide and full. "Have you forgotten the Rio Virgin?" Elizabeth asked. Henry's jaw dropped. "The Rio Virgin is a devil incarnate, Bethy," he said. "We'll not have the trouble the Dixie settlers had. Getting water to our land will be an easy matter. We'll throw a riprap out into the river, and that's all there will be to it." "Oh, Henry, your faith makes you blind. Where are the settlements? Where is the fort?" "Well, the settlements are some space away," Henry admitted. "But we'll make out. You'll see that we will." Elizabeth climbed down from her wagon and went to the edge of the river. She stood there, listlessly, looking at the gray, slow depths of the water. "T haven't forgotten the giant tree that you carried on your placid, deadly surface," she whispered. "I'll never forget that you taunted me, by missing the ferry only by inches. I have no illusions. You are unfriendly and cruel. I hate you!" "Aren't you goin' to cook us this twenty-pound salmon, Mrs. Harriman?" the men called. "We've got it all carved ready for the pan." Elizabeth turned from the river. � Life would go on. Just as surely as eating and sleeping and cooking went on. And she would go with it. "I'm coming!" she called, and went slowly toward the camp.

CENTRAL PACIFIC MISSION RELIEF SOCIETY SENDS FOOD AND CLOTHING TO SAINTS IN JAPAN Georgia H. Weenig, President, Central Pacific Mission Relief Society, reports a recent project of the sisters in her mission, as follows: "During the month of November (1946), under the direction of the Priesthood Welfare Committee and the Relief Society, our mission collected food and clothing and mailed over 200 eleven-pound packages to our saints and friends in stricken Japan. We have just completed our second drive during the month of January, and are now ready to begin the packing and wrapping of our quota of 500 or more boxes. The Relief Society sisters are giving diligent effort to this cause, and I am sure they will receive much spiritual benefit in knowing that they are really aiding in the relief of souls in Japan who need our help so desperately." In further commenting upon activities in her mission, Sister Weenig reports: "We are carrying on the work in our mission Relief Society as usual with our Sunday meetings. In October we organized two Societies on the island of Kauai, and we are now attempting to organize another on the island of Maui. Practically all of our Relief Society members are young school girls or working girls, but these members feel that they are getting a great deal of good out of the lessons, and they have a wonderfully cooperative spirit. The Relief Societies of the Oahu District recently conducted a bazaar and cleared a fairly good amount of money which was divided among the four branches."  Photograph submitted by Martha W.

Notes on Authors of the Lessons HIS year two authors new to Relief Society members appear as writers for Relief Society. Elder Don B. Colton, Director of the Missionary Home, Salt Lake City, has written the theology lessons which are based on Elder James E. Talmage's comprehensive and inspirational book, Jesus the Christ; and Elder Joseph Jacobs has written the social science course, "Essentials in Home Training." Elder Colton, an active and devoted Church worker, was born in Mona, Utah, and lived for many years in Vernal. He attended Brigham Young University and was graduated from the law school of the University of Michigan. After holding many positions in the auxiliary organizations of the Church, (he is now a Sunday School General Board member), he served as president of the Eastern States Mission for four years. He was president of the Uintah Stake for ten years. For twelve years he represented Utah in the United States House of Representatives. He married Grace Stringham of Vernal, Utah, in 1910, and they have four children, Mera, Alice, Glade Byron, and Gwen Mary. A son Don Sterling died in infancy. For the past ten years Elder Colton has been director of the Missionary Home in Salt Lake City, where his kindly and enthusiastic personality and his scholarly and appreciative knowledge of the gospel have been a source of inspiration to thousands of missionaries. Brother Colton's faith and diligence are reflected in his interpretation of the new series of theology lessons. Elder Joseph Jacobs was born in Aleppo, Syria. His parents were converts to the Church, and at the age of sixteen Joseph came to the United States. He was graduated from the Latter-day Saints High School, and received his master's degree in accounting and business administration from the University of Utah. For many years he was a teacher in the Salt Lake City schools, and for two years he had charge of the home missionaries in Ensign Stake. In 1937 he was appointed president of the Palestine-Syrian Mission. His wife, Leone Openshaw Jacobs, now a member of the General Board of Relief Society, and their two children, Geraldine and Lamont, joined Brother Jacobs a year later in the Holy Land. In 1939, at the outbreak of the war, they were recalled to the United States. At the present time Brother Jacobs is a teacher of commercial subjects in the Roosevelt Junior High School, Salt Lake City, and is supervisor of the ward teachers in the South Eighteenth Ward Salt Lake City, Utah. President Amy Brown Lyman continues her series of discussions on "Our Pioneer Heritage" for the visiting teachers' messages, considering for this season "The Fruits of Pioneer Virtues." The literature lessons, "Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants," have been written by Elder H. Wayne Driggs, author of the theology course for the past three years. For information on Sister Lyman and Brother H. Wayne Driggs, see "Notes on the Authors of the Lessons" in the Magazine for July 1946, page 469. Page 483 LESSON Theology�The Life and Ministry of the Savior Elder Don B. Colton Preview of Lessons for 1947-48 THEOLOGY lessons for the next four years will be based upon that excellent book by the late Elder James E. Talmage, entitled Jesus the Christ. The book should be studied in connection with each lesson. This preview will introduce the first eight lessons. Each year a preview will be written covering the lessons to be studied. The main objective of the course is to give the principal events in the Savior's life in such a way as to awaken faith in the souls of all those who study. We believe in the statement of the Savior: And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent (John 17:3). To fully know him, it is necessary to study his life. 'To understand that life, we must know something of the antemortal existence, something of the events and purposes of his earth life, and something of our relationship to him in the life to come. We believe this can be accomplished by carefully following the plan of life mapped out for us by our Redeemer. The titles of the lessons for the year (the names of the first sixteen chapters of Jesus the Christ) are as follows: Page 484 Lesson 1. Preexistence and Foreordination of the Christ Objective: To show the actuality of the birth of the Lord Jesus; and that he was chosen and ordained to be our Redeemer before the world was created. Lesson 2. The Need of a Redeemer; and The Antemortal Godship of Christ Objective: To show that under the gospel plan a Redeemer was absolutely necessary; and that Jesus, our Lord, had attained godship in an antemortal existence. Lesson 3. Earthly Advent of the Christ Predicted; and The Meridian of Time Objective: To demonstrate that the great events of the Savior's life and of his plan of salvation had been revealed aforetime; and to give an explanation of the condition of the Jews during the meridian of time. Lesson 4. Gabriel's Annunciation of John and Jesus; and The Babe of Bethlehem Objective: To show that the coming of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ was announced by an angel sent from God; and that their births fulfilled great promises by angels and prophets. Lesson 5. The Boy of Nazareth; and In the Wilderness of Judea Objective: To prove that Jesus early understood his divine calling, and spent a period of careful preparation for his great ministry. LESSON DEPARTMENT Lesson 6. From Judea to Galilee; and Early Incidents in Our Lord's Public Ministry Objective: To show that Jesus gives ample evidence that he is the Christ to all who honestly seek him; and that righteousness is the greatest force in the world. Lesson 7. Honored by Strangers, Rejected by His Own; and Continuation of Our Lord's Ministry in GalliIg Objective: To prove that Jesus is no respector of persons, but that his blessings are given to all who have faith in him, and who serve him. Lesson 8. Lord of the Sabbath; and The Chosen Twelve. Objective: To show that the Sabbath is distinctly sacred to the people who accept the Lord as their guide. Also, to show that Jesus does have a specific calling in the Priesthood to which he delegates the power to carry on his work in the earth. We urge careful consideration of the great truths concerning the Lord, which have been revealed in this, our day. Probably, Joseph Smith's greatest contribution to the world was a correct understanding of Jesus 485 Christ. It is, therefore, necessary to understand and to be able to tell others of these great truths. We earnestly urge that methods be used to secure class participation. It is the best way for class leaders to ascertain if the learners are really getting a clear understanding of the lessons. An effective class leader will not content herself with studying only the lesson printed in the Magazine. The text should be studied and enrichment material gathered from every approved source. This course affords an opportunity to aid others in securing a testimony of Jesus the Christ. The lessons should be presented with that goal always in mind.

Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, by Elder James E. Talmage, Chapter 2) For Tuesday, October 7, 1947 Objective: To show the actuality of the birth of the Lord Jesus; and that he was chosen and ordained to be our Redeemer before the world was created. MEMBERS of the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will, no doubt, be thrilled at the prospects of studying, in detail, the life of our divine Redeemer. The Church does have a distinctive message concerning him. Let us understand that message clearly. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent (John 17:3). That Jesus of Nazareth did live upon earth is a well-attested fact.  However, no adequate biography was written of him. Probably, it is better that no one attempted such an impossible task. No one ever lived of whom more has been written. No one else has influenced the world for good as much as he. Though a God, he was actually born of woman. No one can successfully disprove the story of his birth.
Through nineteen "sixte centuries," the spirit of the Master has been the greatest power for good in the world. Those who believed in him have been the real pioneers. Missionaries, carrying the Bible, have been first to seek out benighted peoples in every land. A Christian woman, Florence Nightingale, really started the great movement providing hospitals for wounded soldiers upon the battlefields. A man who believed in Christ, Horace Mann, led the movement which resulted in, at least, a common-school education for all the children in the United States. It is well within the mark to say that nearly all great efforts during the last two thousand years to bring happiness and progress to the human family have been made by men and women actuated by the influence and power of our Savior. (Read statement by F. A. Francis in President Grant's book, Treasures I Would Share.)
One outstanding and distinctive feature of the Latter-day Saint Church is its positive affirmation of a correct understanding of Jesus Christ. As we proceed with this course, it will be pointed out that our message is unique and distinctive in many respects. This is said in humility but with boldness. In the spirit of Paul's statement to the Colossians (Col. 1:12-19), we give
"thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet [suitable or worthy] to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light" (Holy Ghost).
Preexistence and Foreordination
It is usual to commence biographies or even a study of the life of an individual with a consideration of the earthly birth. We are not studying now the life of an ordinary person. We are to study the Savior in the light of Isaiah's estimate of him:
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6).
The Holy Scriptures are replete with passages affirming that Jesus the Christ or Jehovah existed with the Father in a preexistent state.
All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made (John 1:3).
For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him and for him:
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
For it pleased the Father that in him [Christ] should all fulness dwell (Col. 1:16-19).
(See also Heb. 1:1-3; and Progress of Man, by Joseph Fielding Smith, page 511.)
To the Latter-day Saints, the word of God is scripture whether it was given anciently or to a modern prophet. From Isaiah we learn that in the beginning another son of God tried to exalt himself. LESSON DEPARTMENT This other son, Lucifer, offered a plan under which all mankind would be re deemed, provided that he, not God, would be given the honor. The rejection of Lucifer's plan caused what is spoken of as the "war in heaven" (Rev. 12:79). This plan would have taken away our free agency. The plan presented by the Lord, Jesus, gave us our free agency and gave the glory to out Father�''thy will be done and the glory be thine forever." A great majority of our Father's children in that antemortal existence accepted the plan of Jesus, even though it might entail temptation to sin, suffering of pain, and even of wandering away from the "path of life." (See Latter-day Saint Hymns, No. 37�"Know This That Every Soul Is Free," etc. See, also, Pearl of Great Price, Moses 4:1-4). The principle of free agency is fundamental in the gospel of Christ. "Freedom and reason make us men." Many men have fought and died rather than give up their free agency and many have been willing to make any sacrifice for freedom. The difference between the Saviors plan and the one offered by Lucifer ls very great. We, as spirit children, were happy when Jehovah's plan was accepted. We voted for it. We undoubtedly joined in the glad chorus when, "Ail the sons of God shouted for joy" (Job 38:7). The important point ls, Jesus was with the Father "in the beginning." Under the direction of the Father, he made the world. He is our Redeemer and Savior. "He was ordained of the Father to be the Savior of mankind." Of course, no date is given as to the exact time when this occurred. 'That is not necessary. 487 We know only that it was "in the beginning." We do know that Jesus had been exalted to be a God while he was yet a "personage of spirit." It is very enlightening to read Ether, 3d chapter in the Book of Mormon. More than two thousand years before his advent upon earth, Jesus the Lord appeared to a great prophet on a lonely mountain side. Even that great prophet, the brother of Jared, seems not to have fully grasped the exact form in which Jesus lived before coming to earth. Because of his great faith, the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord, and it was the finger of a man. "And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood." The Lord showed himself to this man of "exceeding great faith." Jesus was a reality before he was born of woman. He lived and was a glorified "personage of spirit" �a God. In the day in which we live the same glorious truth was reaffirmed (D. & C. 76:13-14)- John, Paul, and other New Testament writers affirm repeatedly that Jesus lived in a preexistent state. The Savior, however, ls Our best witness. "For I came down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me" (John 6:38). Again, these words: "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?" (John 6:62). It might be well to read the entire sixth chapter of John. The writer of this lesson earnestly urges all members to read carefully from the text or from an original 488 source the third footnote following chapter two of Jesus the Christ. There can come to the human mind no more thrilling thought than that Jesus our Redeemer lives. Because he lives, we will live forever. He is our advocate with the Father. He was God in a world as real as this one before he came to this earth. His place in the great plan of salvation has been clearly revealed. How wonderful! Our Father in heaven, the Father of our spirits, exalted his beloved and worthy Son, Jesus the Christ, to become the creator of the world on which we, his spirit children, might have the glorious privilege of receiving a body and having the experience of earth life. Thereafter, we were "translated into the kingdom" of that dear Son (Col. 1:13). He is the King Immanuel� our exemplar, prototype, guide. He marked the path and led the way, And every point defines To light and life and endless day, Where God's full presence shines. Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Aside from the Bible, what evidence is there that Jesus our Savior is divine? 2. How would you prove from the Bible that Jesus lived in a preexistent state and that his work as a creator was done before he came to the earth? Cite passages of scripture. 3. In what way is the salvation of mankind dependent upon the work of our Redeemer? Note: The following quotation will be of interest to Relief Society members: When residing in Kirtland, Elder Reynolds Cahoon had a son born to him, One day when President Joseph Smith was passing his door, he called the Prophet in and asked him to bless and name the baby. Joseph did so and gave the boy the name of Mahonri Moriancumer. When he had finished the blessing he laid the child on the bed and turning to Elder Cahoon he said, "The name I have given your son is the name of the brother of Jared; the Lord has just shown (or revealed) the name." Elder William Cahoon, who was standing near, heard the Prophet make this statement to his father; and this was the first time the name of the brother of Jared was known in the Church in this dispensation.

The subject matter for the visiting teachers' department for the year 1947-48 will again be presented LESSON DEPARTMENT � under the general title "Our Pioneer Heritage." Last year the lessons featured pioneer virtues. This year the objective will be to call attention to and emphasize some of the accomplishments of the pioneers which came as a result of their virtues and their practices, the better to encourage them.
The discussions last year recalled many incidents, family experiences, and stories which greatly enriched the messages as they were considered in both the classroom and in the home. Especially interesting and dramatic were incidents related by some of the elderly women who remembered stories told to them firsthand by the pioneers of the plains, and also incidents connected with their own personal experiences in helping to pioneer remote settlements here in the West. Interest was stimulated by some class leaders, who made it a point to announce the subject for the next lesson a month ahead of time and to encourage the members to read the lesson carefully, talk it over in the home, and come prepared to take part in the class discussion. As a result, many faith promoting stories and interesting experiences have been related. Most interesting also were excerpts from old diaries, which were brought to class and read by descendants of early pioneers. These diaries, which bring to life thrilling human interest stories, are valuable and should be carefully preserved. Practically every visiting teacher and every individual visited has been able to contribute to the discussions.
Friendly visiting by Relief Society teachers is one of the oldest institutions in the Society. The organization was only one year old when six-
teen of its members were appointed to visit the four districts in Nauvoo. Today there are 51,678 visiting teachers in the organization, and 18,155 districts. Last year's report (1946) showed that the teachers made 1,237,960 visits to the homes. If all of the 51,678 visiting teachers would, in a given year, familiarize themselves with the messages and make it a practice to discuss them in the 177,770 homes on their visits, what a power they could be in creating desirable sentiment and influencing people for good.
It is hoped that this timely subject "Our Pioneer Heritage" has been and will be so thoroughly discussed that it will make an important contribution to the spirit of Utah's great Centennial, the prime purpose of which is to call to mind and to emphasize the deeds and accomplishments of the pioneers of Utah, and perpetuate their memories by music, song, and pageant, and by dedicating to the pioneers that mighty monument "This Is the Place."
"By their fruits ye shall know them." Yes, by the fruits of our noble pioneers we shall ever know and remember them.

The Story of Essentials Lesson |�Organization President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, October 7, 1947 Objective: To show the marvelous result of the God-inspired plan used by our pioneers in crossing the plains. NE of the distinguishing characteristics of Latter-day Saints is their understanding and appreciation of the efficacy of organized efforts and the importance of co-operation between individuals and _between groups. This understanding and knowledge is a heritage from the Church itself, the organization of which was divinely inspired. The perfect organization and operation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is ample evidence of its divine origin. The government of the Church is vested in the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve, assisted by other General Authorities, by general officers of various departments, and boards of auxiliary organizations. It is divided into stakes and missions and subdivided into wards and branches. The organization and work is thus built and set up on order, authority, love-inspired obedience, and co-operation, and operates with precision and efficiency. In making plans and preparations for crossing the plains, it was only natural that one of the first considerations should be the careful and proper organization of the companies, and it was largely due to the efforts in this direction that the LESSON DEPARTMENT companies were so successful. (See D. & C. 136). In his biography, pioneer Elijah Mayhew, who crossed the plains from Winter Quarters in 1853 and was one of the clerks of his company, shows how the company was carefully organized, and gives some interesting details regarding its organization and operation. He reports that the company consisted of 232 souls, seventy wagons, 125 horses, 360 head of cattle, and 126 sheep. Captains D. R. Miller and John Cooley were in command. The company was divided into groups of fifty, which were subdivided into groups of ten. Each group of fifty had a captain, a sergeant of guard, a chaplain, and a clerk. Following are the rules and regulations as recorded by him: 1�Camp will be called by the sound of a trumpet for prayer morning and evening. 2�Card playing will not be allowed. 3�Profane language will not be allowed. 4�Dogs must be tied up at night. 5�No noise nor confusion of any kind will be allowed after 8 p. M. 6�The horn will blow for arising at 4:30 a. M. 7�Assembly for prayers at 5:30 am. 8�Each man will assist in driving the cattle. O�The 491 horn will blow as notice to bring in the cattle. 10�The corral, formed by placing wagons side by side, will not be broken nor any wagon move from the yard in the morning until all the cattle are yoked. 11�The rate of travel for oxen, 3 miles per hour. The names of all individuals, he explains, were enrolled; and, for the company, he kept a daily diary. If additional individuals joined the company along the route, their names and the date of their arrival were kept. All accidents and troubles were recorded; for example, the accident of Lucy Ann Miller, in which her leg was broken but successfully set. Upon the arrival of the company in Salt Lake City, resolutions of respect and appreciation were drafted and presented to Captains Miller and Cooley for their kindness, efficient leader ship, wise counsel, and tender care. Suggestions for Discussion The class might be encouraged to add examples of how the Church, through its perfect organization, has been able, on short notice, to collect needed information, facts, and statistics, and to carry out necessary programs. Literature-Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants Elder H. Wayne Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1947-48 THE three-year series of Church history lessons brought to a close last May dealt with the theological study of the Doctrine and Covenants. It has been felt that some time could, with profit, be spent in enjoying this modern scripture from a literary point of view. Certain it is that many in the Relief Society have expressed the hope that time might be taken in a series of lessons on the literary values of the 492 Doctrine and Covenants. It is with this thought in mind that a year's course of study has been written in such a field. There are within the words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith a variety of literary forms. The literary values of the Doctrine and Covenants add joy to the gospel message given. To make a complete study of the literature of this modern scripture demands much time. In the present series of lessons in this field only the high lights of such a work may be outlined. It is hoped that such an outline will prove inviting for further study, and that much pleasure may be gained by reviewing the Passages of the Doctrine and Covenants in another light. The first lesson is introductory. Lesson 1. Introductory Lesson to "The Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants" Objective: To present a short historical account of the coming forth of the book the Doctrine and Covenants, and to call attention to the great work of the Prophet Joseph Smith as a revelator, and the necessity for Latter-day Saints to study the revelations. The lesson titles and objectives for the literature course to follow are: Lesson 2. Literary Values of the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the truth and beauty it contains. Lesson 3. Types of Literature Found In the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the various forms of literature contained in the revealed word of the Lord. Lesson 4. Epistles of the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the letters of the Prophet to the saints and the word of the Lord to the Prophet while a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri. Lesson 5. Prayers of the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the Prayers it contains, which are not unlike the lyric or song. Lesson 6. Visions of the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the apocalyptic type of lit. Literature. Lesson 7. Doctrinal Exposition ot the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the wisdom contained in this modern scripture. Lesson 8, Appreciation Values in Doctrine and Covenants Reading Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the values to be received from the Lord's word.
