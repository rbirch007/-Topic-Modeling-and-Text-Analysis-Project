Pioneer Gardenmaking Hazel D. Moyle One of the thrills of the centennial celebration comes when we travel to that historic spot where the pioneers first gazed out over the Salt Lake Valley; where their beloved leader uttered those famous words, "This Is the Place," now marked by a magnificent monument to commemorate this important event. As we look out over this lovely panorama that now greets the eye from this vantage point�a valley filled with beautiful homes shaded by a veritable forest of rich green� our thoughts naturally turn to the scene as it was on that historic day just one hundred years ago. How did it appear to that footsore and weary band when they first gazed out over the new promised land? We are told that the pioneers were awed and thrilled by the inspiring scene, with its towering mountains, its vast sweep, and its glittering lake. Yet historians also record that the women of the party were dismayed at the very immensity of the place, at its boundless silences and wide stretches of barren soil, the gray unbroken sage. ~The silence of centuries hung over all, for the few trappers and explorers who had ventured into the Valley had left no trace of their coming or going. In speaking of those first days in the new land in later years, Clara D. Young, one of the original pioneers, declared: "I don't remember a single tree that could be called by that name." Small wonder that the courageous hearts of those brave Page 458 women quailed at the thought of making a home in this vast and lonely place. But soon the long unbroken silences were disturbed by new sounds: of feverish activity�the plow as it turned the furrows and the shovels that diverted the mountain streams to the thirsty soil. Ere long the music of the hammer, the axe, and the saw resounded through the Valley as the indefatigable pioneers labored to provide shelter and food. History now gives those first few years a place as one of the greatest of human struggles against adversity, for from it emerged, in but a few short seasons, a real transformation. A bustling and prosperous new com: munity arose from the desert, with wide and orderly streets shaded by beautiful trees. Neat and charming homes were set off and made beautiful by orchards and gardens. Visitors and travelers were astonished to find such peaceful and ordered beauty in this raw new country�so entirely different from the usual frontier community. How was this transformation achieved so quickly in this far and isolated western country? The answer lies in the high purposes of the pioneers. They were not seeking adventure or wealth, but were a people motivated by a single dream, by a deep abiding hunger for peaceful homes and the right to worship God unmolested. And so they worked together to make those dreams a reality. PIONEER GARDENMAKING 459 WITH converts from all walks of life constantly arriving from many parts of Europe, as well as from all sections of our own country, the city soon reflected the finest traditions of culture in the new homes as they were built. The architecture of these early pioneer homes has been declared classic by many famous modern designers. The plantings about those old homes were also in the traditional style, due, in some measure, to a number of the early pioneer gardeners who had been trained in some of the great garden estates of Eng-land and Germany. Their skill was naturally employed in beautifying the new community. The majority of the gardens were of the simple cottage type, made up of plants grown from slips and starts of old, well-loved plants brought from former homes. Incredible as it might seem to the pampered gardener of today, many of these first plants and slips crossed the plains in the covered wagons along with all the worldly possessions of many pioneer flower lovers. Our amazing pioneer grandmothers could face all the dangers and privations of building a new civilization in a wilderness, yet they cherished and knew the value of a flower. Many of them lovingly cared for Photograph, Courtesy Hazel D. Moyle MRS. HANNAH M. FOWLKS, EARLY PIONEER OF THE COTTONWooD DISTRICT IN SALT LAKE COUNTY, SHOWN IN HER GARDEN R 460 small slips and starts of favorite plants on that long journey, and carefully nursed them into growing in the strange new location. Rare old rose varieties, shrubs, bulbs, and even trees are still persisting in many Utah gardens and are proudly cherished because their ancestors traveled across the plains in those early days. Conspicuous among these flower-loving pioneers was Sister Hannah M. Fowlks, a native of England, who was one of the early settlers of the Cottonwood district in Salt Lake County. Sister Fowlks nearly achieved the impossible when she came to Utah by bringing on that long, tiresome journey several plants of the English primrose. Anyone who has grown this sweet flower of spring will realize what a feat of steadfast devotion and patience this must have been, for the primrose demands constant moisture, coolness, and protection from drying winds and sun. It has a disconcerting habit of suddenly dying off if these wants are not provided. Yet Sister Fowlks was able to bring her plants safely here, and to keep them happy and growing in her new home, which, at first, was a rude log cabin entirely surrounded by sagebrush. WATER to keep her plants growing was carried in buckets from a stream some distance away, yet she established a flourishing garden with her beloved primroses and other plants. Soon she had a better home and a large garden where such treasured plants as the old Maiden's Blush rose, the tea rose, yellow buttercups, daffodils, violas, and other old favorites grew. The primroses responded to her love and devotion by increasing until they grew in all parts of the place, even along the ditchbanks in her orchard. The poet speaks of a man to whom: A yellow primrose by a river's brim A yellow primrose was to him, And it was nothing more.... �William Wordsworth But to Sister Fowlks, and, it seems, to most English-born people, this flower breathes the very spirit of the English countryside, its verdant green lanes and flowery meadows, for it grows wild in many parts of that country. It was the writer's privilege to visit Sister Fowlks' dear old garden more than seventy years after its beginning, and it was still sweet and gay with primroses, all descendants of those first pioneering plants. Over all these years Sister Fowlks had shared her flowers with neighbors and friends, providing blooms for "weddings or a festival, a mourning, or a funeral." Many a bride's cake was crowned with sweet white rosebuds from her garden, but perhaps her greatest pleasure was that of providing a beautiful bouquet of flowers to grace the speaker's stand each Sunday at the Cottonwood Ward chapel. She performed this service faithfully every Sunday from the time the ward was organized until shortly before she passed away in 1935 at the grand old age of ninety-three. Yes, indeed, flowers played an important part in early pioneer life of Utah. A Place in the Country III-WATER Ruby Scranton Jones [This is the third in 4 series of five short-short stories. Ed] AS Ellen Martin washed the supper dishes, she looked out the window and saw her husband talking to Mr. Hawkins, their neighbor on the north. When he came in, John said, "It's our turn to irrigate at eleven tonight. Mr. Hawkins says he'll turn the water in when his time is up. He's been taking care of this place, you know."
"But John! Eleven! How can you see to do it at night?" Ellen objected.
"Oh, I'll take that old lantern I found in the garage." John sat down and rested his arms on the table. Ellen noticed how tired his eyes looked. She thought he was even thinner than when they came.
"You can't do it," she said positively. "You were too tired to eat your supper after working on that fence all day. Let it go."
"I can't do that," John answered, just as positively. "We get the water only two hours in about two weeks and you know how dry the orchard is. It's just one of those things that every farmer expects."
"Then I'll do it." Ellen hung the dish towel on the rope stretched over the stove. "You can tell me how."
"No!" John got up and started for the door. "I won't have my wife doing man's work. You do far too much as it is."
"Nonsense." Ellen caught John's arm and pulled him back to the chair. "Every farm woman expects to help out wherever she's needed. I'll get the lantern and fill it."
After the children were in bed, John wearily explained the little he knew about irrigation. "And do see that those peach trees back of the garage get plenty. I've an idea they'll bring in more than all the other trees put together. And we're sure going to need that fruit money."
When Ellen was lighting the lantern, he added, "You'd better take your sweater. There's a cool breeze at night."
So, wearing her oldest shoes and sweater and carrying the lantern and the hoe, Ellen started out. Immediately swarms of mosquitoes circled around her head and settled on every exposed bit of flesh. She could even feel them bite through her heavy cotton stockings. She pulled the sweater up around her neck and buttoned it, even though she was already too warm. She was glad John had not thought about mosquitoes or he would have made even more objections.
As she reached the far corner of their place where the water came in from the canal, she saw dark streaks down the first two ditches. In stepping over one of these she slipped and sank into mud over her ankles. 462 She set down the lantern, pulled her feet free, and started to direct the water with the hoe. When she stopped a moment to brush off the mosquitoes, she noticed how dark it was. The light at Hawkins' had gone out soon after she had started. She turned toward her own house. It was dark, too, so John must have gone to bed. She had never been out in the dark like this before, and she began to feel a little nervous. In town when she had been out at night, there had been street lights and auto lights. She looked around. There was not a light anywhere�not a sound. It couldn't be much different if she were all alone in the world, she thought. But she musn't waste time. She picked up the lantern and started over to the next ditch. Suddenly, she heard a crunching sound and saw a huge dark shape by the fence. Without a second look, she started to run toward the house. But she stumbled on the uneven ground and fell flat, throwing the lantern before her. It went out, and as she quickly scrambled to her feet, she remembered she had brought no matches. She looked back. The moon was just coming up over the distant mountains. The dark shape was in the same place and now she heard a low "moo." It was only a cow, she concluded, and, anyway, it couldn't get through the fence. How silly of her. She left the lantern and went back. She knew she would soon be able to see better without it. WHEN she was about half done, she sat down on the ground to rest awhile and rub the welts that were rising all over her legs and face. She looked towards the nearest tree and saw eyes gleaming from the shadows. All the stories she had heard of coyotes, wolves, and pumas flashed through her mind. But this time she picked up the hoe and advanced, thinking nothing much worse could happen to her anyway. She heard a friendly "meow," and laughed out loud as she reached down. A dog howled in the distance and the cat disappeared. At last she was ready to water the peach trees. When she turned the water that way, she noticed that it wasn't flowing so freely. Soon it stopped altogether. She walked back along the main ditch and saw a man with a flashlight at the canal gate. He was shutting off her water. "I'm not through," Ellen called indignantly. "I haven't watered the last row." The man turned the flashlight on her face as he said gruffly, "I can't help that, sister. Your time's up." Ellen had to turn away from the light. She couldn't see the man at all, but she knew it must be Mr. Ford from the farm to the south. What was it she had heard about Mr. Ford anyway? "I've got to have more water." Ellen was really angry now. "Well, you can't. Don't you know people have been shot for taking water out of turn?" "I don't believe it. Silly." "Try it and see." The man laughed harshly, and then Ellen remembered the story about a fight Over water a year ago. As he followed the canal to his place, Ellen noticed how big he was. That's just A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY 'Just a bully," she muttered and started back to the house. "J didn't suppose country people would be like that." Her anger made her hot, and the heat made the mosquito bites sting. She got a pan of water and washed her muddy feet. 'Then she rubbed salt on the bites. She thought she had never been so miserable in her life.. When she went to the bedroom John asked sleepily, "How did you make out?" "Fine, just fine," she answered as 463 she crawled into bed. She certainly wasn't going to tell John how impolite that man had been. After all, he was a neighbor and they'd have to get along with him. She tried to lie still and not scratch the bites. "Tomorrow she'd pump water from the well and carry it to the peach trees. Next time she'd take John's watch and keep track of the time. If she didn't let cows and cats and the dark bother her, she would do better. And 50, finally, she fell asleep.

Their faces are grim as they hurry along, But they stop at dusk with a rousing song, And weary oxen lower their heads, While silent women make up the beds. The sparks burn out from the campfires bright; Beside their families the men sleep light, Aware of a storm, or an Indian raid, But deep in their hearts they are not afraid. Their bodies are strong with a dream they know, 'A home, a place for their loved ones to go. A spot to worship as Go rt loved ones to go, d may commend, That's the promise which lives at the journey's end.

Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, July 2, and July 15, 1887 "For THE RighTs OF THE WOMEN oF ZION AND tHE RIGHTS OF THE WoMEN OF ALL Nations" TIMELY REFLECTIONS: Aslant the misty morning air, through glittering circlets of rainbow hue, comes the glorious orb of day peeping o'er yon snow-capped mountain peak, casting its brilliant sheen o'er the teeming valley below, where myriads of happy songsters are pouting forth their glad welcome in a grand concert of tuneful melody. --: My spirit gathers renewed strength and buoyancy, and from my inmost soul springs forth an anthem of thanksgiving and praise for my birthplace, Zion, in whose development and progress MY greatest desires are centered.�Sun Flower. FROM ONEIDA STAKE, IDAHO: We should be kind to each other, and especially to those who are left to provide for their families without the aid of father oF husband.. -- We should be very wise in counseling our children, for they are our hope all things which are injurious to your health. Do not neglect your duties in the Relief Society for your work; if you wait for the time when you have nothing to do, you will never go, for a mother's work is never done. �Counselor Mary Hawkes, from her address at stake conference. LET US WORSHIP GOD Let us worship God on the mountains, In the valley, on the hill, Where the wild, free harps of nature With the grandest music thrill, Let us worship him with singing, And with the voice of prayer, And, as he is ever present, Let us worship everywhere. �Belle Bush A FEW THOUGHTS: How like the olden times is the present. Then it was 4 band of Pilgrims fleeing from arbitrary tule. -- - How like to the little band of saints who left their homes in the East, driven from state to state. and when, after surmounting untold difficulties, praying a thousand dangers, and suffering the pangs of hunger and sickness, they found a home in these mountains, and with their love of liberties the rose, and the barren waste a fruitful field.. - We, like the Pilgrim Fathers, put our trust in the Supreme Ruler, knowing he will defend our rights and deal out justice and equity to all. We know that God lives and that he has revealed himself to man in this day, and we know we have seen his power made manifest, and make bold to declare it to all nations �SA. Fullmer.

Page 465  EDITORIAL Pioneer Example of Obedience Here is the exact OCR transcription of the text:
THROUGHOUT the Lord's dealings with ancient Israel in the centuries that followed the exodus from Egypt, there was ever kept alive in the memories of the children of Israel the loving kindness of the Lord to them, manifested in sparing the lives of their first-born, delivering them from bondage to the Egyptians, and bringing them to a promised land. Those events were memorialized by the institution of the Feast of the Passover, observed by Christ during his earthly ministry and still commemorated by orthodox Jews.
In these latter days, as in former times, the Lord guards, protects, and cherishes his chosen people in so far as their obedience to his commandments allows.
The year 1947 is being observed by Latter-day Saints throughout the world in remembrance of the goodness of the Lord to his people when he led them to their promised land one hundred years ago.
By the year 1847 the saints had been persecuted and driven from state to state but, like the children of Israel, they were finally permitted to leave their persecutors behind and journey to their promised land�a place foreseen by Isaiah:
And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above
the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it (Isaiah 2:2).
When the pioneers arrived at their destination, it did not appear as a land flowing with milk and honey. Had the prophet leader not previously been shown the appointed place in vision, there would have been nothing to indicate to mortal eye that the parched land, baking under the hot sun, with a salt sea shimmering against the horizon, was the land of promise for the weary wagon train. The pioneers had traveled through greener lands and they knew that greener lands lay beyond, but, obedient to the word of the Lord, their leader Brigham Young declared that the forbidding place was the right place. That Valley of alkali, of sagebrush, without vegetation, burning under the rays of a July sun, where a living must be sweated by toil and sweat, where long hours of back-breaking work would be needed to eke out an existence, was declared to be the right place. A place which offered no worldly wealth but was destined to provide a richness in eternal values.
Viewed from the eminence of a hundred years, it is easy to trace out reasons why the Lord instructed his prophet to settle his chosen people in the valleys of the mountains. 466
PIONEER EXAMPLE OF OBEDIENCE But viewed in the lights of events transpiring in that day, there were some who questioned the dicta of the Lord's prophet, not only as regarded the place of settlement, but likewise in subsequent decisions and_ pronouncements by Church leaders. Latter-day Saints living today continue to be warned, exhorted, and instructed by the Lord's prophets as to their daily conduct and dealings. Some members of the Church take umbrage at advice which to man's wisdom may seem foolish and unnecessary. Such people may know that their influence and example will melt away and vanish in the coming years as snow on a summer mountain side. On this July 24, 1947 and in 467 succeeding years, the love, honor, and respect of the Lord's chosen people will be poured out on those faithful pioneers who laid the foundations of this mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains. Likewise, one hundred years from now, to that number so honored will be added, in remembrance, faithful, obedient Latter-day Saints living today who do not place man's wisdom above the will of the Lord as revealed through his prophets. When that numbering takes place, may it comprise the great present body of the Church! M. CSS. General Board Expresses Appreciation to Relief Society Members for Work in Clothing Donation THE General Board of Relief Society extends grateful appreciation to the members of Relief Society throughout the stakes of Continental United States for the great contribution the sisters made in the recent donation of clothing and needed articles for the European saints. Relief Society visiting teachers are highly commended for delivering the message of the General Board to Latter-day Saint families, calling attention to the donation, and Relief Society ward and stake members who received, listed, sorted, and helped label and pack the articles into boxes, are especially thanked. The General Board recognizes and appreciates the willingness of the sisters of Relief Socicty to freely donate their services to any-and every call made upon them by the Church.
