Notes on Authors of the Lessons HIS year two authors new to Relief Society members appear as writers for Relief Society. Elder Don B. Colton, Director of the Missionary Home, Salt Lake City, has written the theology lessons which are based on Elder James E. Talmage's comprehensive and inspirational book, Jesus the Christ; and Elder Joseph Jacobs has written the social science course, "Essentials in Home Training." Elder Colton, an active and devoted Church worker, was born in Mona, Utah, and lived for many years in Vernal. He attended Brigham Young University and was graduated from the law school of the University of Michigan. After holding many positions in the auxiliary organizations of the Church, (he is now a Sunday School General Board member), he served as president of the Eastern States Mission for four years. He was president of the Uintah Stake for ten years. For twelve years he represented Utah in the United States House of Representatives. He married Grace Stringham of Vernal, Utah, in 1910, and they have four children, Mera, Alice, Glade Byron, and Gwen Mary. A son Don Sterling died in infancy. For the past ten years Elder Colton has been director of the Missionary Home in Salt Lake City, where his kindly and enthusiastic personality and his scholarly and appreciative knowledge of the gospel have been a source of inspiration to thousands of missionaries. Brother Colton's faith and diligence are reflected in his interpretation of the new series of theology lessons. Elder Joseph Jacobs was born in Aleppo, Syria. His parents were converts to the Church, and at the age of sixteen Joseph came to the United States. He was graduated from the Latter-day Saints High School, and received his master's degree in accounting and business administration from the University of Utah. For many years he was a teacher in the Salt Lake City schools, and for two years he had charge of the home missionaries in Ensign Stake. In 1937 he was appointed president of the Palestine-Syrian Mission. His wife, Leone Openshaw Jacobs, now a member of the General Board of Relief Society, and their two children, Geraldine and Lamont, joined Brother Jacobs a year later in the Holy Land. In 1939, at the outbreak of the war, they were recalled to the United States. At the present time Brother Jacobs is a teacher of commercial subjects in the Roosevelt Junior High School, Salt Lake City, and is supervisor of the ward teachers in the South Eighteenth Ward Salt Lake City, Utah. President Amy Brown Lyman continues her series of discussions on "Our Pioneer Heritage" for the visiting teachers' messages, considering for this season "The Fruits of Pioneer Virtues." The literature lessons, "Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants," have been written by Elder H. Wayne Driggs, author of the theology course for the past three years. For information on Sister Lyman and Brother H. Wayne Driggs, see "Notes on the Authors of the Lessons" in the Magazine for July 1946, page 469. Page 483 LESSON Theology�The Life and Ministry of the Savior Elder Don B. Colton Preview of Lessons for 1947-48 THEOLOGY lessons for the next four years will be based upon that excellent book by the late Elder James E. Talmage, entitled Jesus the Christ. The book should be studied in connection with each lesson. This preview will introduce the first eight lessons. Each year a preview will be written covering the lessons to be studied. The main objective of the course is to give the principal events in the Savior's life in such a way as to awaken faith in the souls of all those who study. We believe in the statement of the Savior: And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent (John 17:3). To fully know him, it is necessary to study his life. 'To understand that life, we must know something of the antemortal existence, something of the events and purposes of his earth life, and something of our relationship to him in the life to come. We believe this can be accomplished by carefully following the plan of life mapped out for us by our Redeemer. The titles of the lessons for the year (the names of the first sixteen chapters of Jesus the Christ) are as follows: Page 484 Lesson 1. Preexistence and Foreordination of the Christ Objective: To show the actuality of the birth of the Lord Jesus; and that he was chosen and ordained to be our Redeemer before the world was created. Lesson 2. The Need of a Redeemer; and The Antemortal Godship of Christ Objective: To show that under the gospel plan a Redeemer was absolutely necessary; and that Jesus, our Lord, had attained godship in an antemortal existence. Lesson 3. Earthly Advent of the Christ Predicted; and The Meridian of Time Objective: To demonstrate that the great events of the Savior's life and of his plan of salvation had been revealed aforetime; and to give an explanation of the condition of the Jews during the meridian of time. Lesson 4. Gabriel's Annunciation of John and Jesus; and The Babe of Bethlehem Objective: To show that the coming of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ was announced by an angel sent from God; and that their births fulfilled great promises by angels and prophets. Lesson 5. The Boy of Nazareth; and In the Wilderness of Judea Objective: To prove that Jesus early understood his divine calling, and spent a period of careful preparation for his great ministry. LESSON DEPARTMENT Lesson 6. From Judea to Galilee; and Early Incidents in Our Lord's Public Ministry Objective: To show that Jesus gives ample evidence that he is the Christ to all who honestly seek him; and that righteousness is the greatest force in the world. Lesson 7. Honored by Strangers, Rejected by His Own; and Continuation of Our Lord's Ministry in GalliIg Objective: To prove that Jesus is no respector of persons, but that his blessings are given to all who have faith in him, and who serve him. Lesson 8. Lord of the Sabbath; and The Chosen Twelve. Objective: To show that the Sabbath is distinctly sacred to the people who accept the Lord as their guide. Also, to show that Jesus does have a specific calling in the Priesthood to which he delegates the power to carry on his work in the earth. We urge careful consideration of the great truths concerning the Lord, which have been revealed in this, our day. Probably, Joseph Smith's greatest contribution to the world was a correct understanding of Jesus 485 Christ. It is, therefore, necessary to understand and to be able to tell others of these great truths. We earnestly urge that methods be used to secure class participation. It is the best way for class leaders to ascertain if the learners are really getting a clear understanding of the lessons. An effective class leader will not content herself with studying only the lesson printed in the Magazine. The text should be studied and enrichment material gathered from every approved source. This course affords an opportunity to aid others in securing a testimony of Jesus the Christ. The lessons should be presented with that goal always in mind.

Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, by Elder James E. Talmage, Chapter 2) For Tuesday, October 7, 1947 Objective: To show the actuality of the birth of the Lord Jesus; and that he was chosen and ordained to be our Redeemer before the world was created. MEMBERS of the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will, no doubt, be thrilled at the prospects of studying, in detail, the life of our divine Redeemer. The Church does have a distinctive message concerning him. Let us understand that message clearly. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent (John 17:3). That Jesus of Nazareth did live upon earth is a well-attested fact.  However, no adequate biography was written of him. Probably, it is better that no one attempted such an impossible task. No one ever lived of whom more has been written. No one else has influenced the world for good as much as he. Though a God, he was actually born of woman. No one can successfully disprove the story of his birth.
Through nineteen "sixte centuries," the spirit of the Master has been the greatest power for good in the world. Those who believed in him have been the real pioneers. Missionaries, carrying the Bible, have been first to seek out benighted peoples in every land. A Christian woman, Florence Nightingale, really started the great movement providing hospitals for wounded soldiers upon the battlefields. A man who believed in Christ, Horace Mann, led the movement which resulted in, at least, a common-school education for all the children in the United States. It is well within the mark to say that nearly all great efforts during the last two thousand years to bring happiness and progress to the human family have been made by men and women actuated by the influence and power of our Savior. (Read statement by F. A. Francis in President Grant's book, Treasures I Would Share.)
One outstanding and distinctive feature of the Latter-day Saint Church is its positive affirmation of a correct understanding of Jesus Christ. As we proceed with this course, it will be pointed out that our message is unique and distinctive in many respects. This is said in humility but with boldness. In the spirit of Paul's statement to the Colossians (Col. 1:12-19), we give
"thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet [suitable or worthy] to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light" (Holy Ghost).
Preexistence and Foreordination
It is usual to commence biographies or even a study of the life of an individual with a consideration of the earthly birth. We are not studying now the life of an ordinary person. We are to study the Savior in the light of Isaiah's estimate of him:
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6).
The Holy Scriptures are replete with passages affirming that Jesus the Christ or Jehovah existed with the Father in a preexistent state.
All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made (John 1:3).
For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him and for him:
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
For it pleased the Father that in him [Christ] should all fulness dwell (Col. 1:16-19).
(See also Heb. 1:1-3; and Progress of Man, by Joseph Fielding Smith, page 511.)
To the Latter-day Saints, the word of God is scripture whether it was given anciently or to a modern prophet. From Isaiah we learn that in the beginning another son of God tried to exalt himself. LESSON DEPARTMENT This other son, Lucifer, offered a plan under which all mankind would be re deemed, provided that he, not God, would be given the honor. The rejection of Lucifer's plan caused what is spoken of as the "war in heaven" (Rev. 12:79). This plan would have taken away our free agency. The plan presented by the Lord, Jesus, gave us our free agency and gave the glory to out Father�''thy will be done and the glory be thine forever." A great majority of our Father's children in that antemortal existence accepted the plan of Jesus, even though it might entail temptation to sin, suffering of pain, and even of wandering away from the "path of life." (See Latter-day Saint Hymns, No. 37�"Know This That Every Soul Is Free," etc. See, also, Pearl of Great Price, Moses 4:1-4). The principle of free agency is fundamental in the gospel of Christ. "Freedom and reason make us men." Many men have fought and died rather than give up their free agency and many have been willing to make any sacrifice for freedom. The difference between the Saviors plan and the one offered by Lucifer ls very great. We, as spirit children, were happy when Jehovah's plan was accepted. We voted for it. We undoubtedly joined in the glad chorus when, "Ail the sons of God shouted for joy" (Job 38:7). The important point ls, Jesus was with the Father "in the beginning." Under the direction of the Father, he made the world. He is our Redeemer and Savior. "He was ordained of the Father to be the Savior of mankind." Of course, no date is given as to the exact time when this occurred. 'That is not necessary. 487 We know only that it was "in the beginning." We do know that Jesus had been exalted to be a God while he was yet a "personage of spirit." It is very enlightening to read Ether, 3d chapter in the Book of Mormon. More than two thousand years before his advent upon earth, Jesus the Lord appeared to a great prophet on a lonely mountain side. Even that great prophet, the brother of Jared, seems not to have fully grasped the exact form in which Jesus lived before coming to earth. Because of his great faith, the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord, and it was the finger of a man. "And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood." The Lord showed himself to this man of "exceeding great faith." Jesus was a reality before he was born of woman. He lived and was a glorified "personage of spirit" �a God. In the day in which we live the same glorious truth was reaffirmed (D. & C. 76:13-14)- John, Paul, and other New Testament writers affirm repeatedly that Jesus lived in a preexistent state. The Savior, however, ls Our best witness. "For I came down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me" (John 6:38). Again, these words: "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?" (John 6:62). It might be well to read the entire sixth chapter of John. The writer of this lesson earnestly urges all members to read carefully from the text or from an original 488 source the third footnote following chapter two of Jesus the Christ. There can come to the human mind no more thrilling thought than that Jesus our Redeemer lives. Because he lives, we will live forever. He is our advocate with the Father. He was God in a world as real as this one before he came to this earth. His place in the great plan of salvation has been clearly revealed. How wonderful! Our Father in heaven, the Father of our spirits, exalted his beloved and worthy Son, Jesus the Christ, to become the creator of the world on which we, his spirit children, might have the glorious privilege of receiving a body and having the experience of earth life. Thereafter, we were "translated into the kingdom" of that dear Son (Col. 1:13). He is the King Immanuel� our exemplar, prototype, guide. He marked the path and led the way, And every point defines To light and life and endless day, Where God's full presence shines. Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Aside from the Bible, what evidence is there that Jesus our Savior is divine? 2. How would you prove from the Bible that Jesus lived in a preexistent state and that his work as a creator was done before he came to the earth? Cite passages of scripture. 3. In what way is the salvation of mankind dependent upon the work of our Redeemer? Note: The following quotation will be of interest to Relief Society members: When residing in Kirtland, Elder Reynolds Cahoon had a son born to him, One day when President Joseph Smith was passing his door, he called the Prophet in and asked him to bless and name the baby. Joseph did so and gave the boy the name of Mahonri Moriancumer. When he had finished the blessing he laid the child on the bed and turning to Elder Cahoon he said, "The name I have given your son is the name of the brother of Jared; the Lord has just shown (or revealed) the name." Elder William Cahoon, who was standing near, heard the Prophet make this statement to his father; and this was the first time the name of the brother of Jared was known in the Church in this dispensation. (The Juvenile Instructor, Vol. 27, May 1892, page 282). Reference Talmage, James E.: Jesus the Christ, chapter 2. �Visiting Teachers' Messages�Our Pioneer Heritage The Fruits of Pioneer Virtues President Amy Brown Lyman Preview of Lessons for 1947-48 WHEREFORE by their fruits ye shall know them" (Matt. 7:20). The subject matter for the visiting teachers' department for the year 1947-48 will again be presented LESSON DEPARTMENT � under the general title "Our Pioneer Heritage." Last year the lessons featured pioneer virtues. This year the objective will be to call attention to and emphasize some of the accomplishments of the pioneers which came as a result of their virtues and their practices, the better to encourage them.
The discussions last year recalled many incidents, family experiences, and stories which greatly enriched the messages as they were considered in both the classroom and in the home. Especially interesting and dramatic were incidents related by some of the elderly women who remembered stories told to them firsthand by the pioneers of the plains, and also incidents connected with their own personal experiences in helping to pioneer remote settlements here in the West. Interest was stimulated by some class leaders, who made it a point to announce the subject for the next lesson a month ahead of time and to encourage the members to read the lesson carefully, talk it over in the home, and come prepared to take part in the class discussion. As a result, many faith promoting stories and interesting experiences have been related. Most interesting also were excerpts from old diaries, which were brought to class and read by descendants of early pioneers. These diaries, which bring to life thrilling human interest stories, are valuable and should be carefully preserved. Practically every visiting teacher and every individual visited has been able to contribute to the discussions.
Friendly visiting by Relief Society teachers is one of the oldest institutions in the Society. The organization was only one year old when six-
teen of its members were appointed to visit the four districts in Nauvoo. Today there are 51,678 visiting teachers in the organization, and 18,155 districts. Last year's report (1946) showed that the teachers made 1,237,960 visits to the homes. If all of the 51,678 visiting teachers would, in a given year, familiarize themselves with the messages and make it a practice to discuss them in the 177,770 homes on their visits, what a power they could be in creating desirable sentiment and influencing people for good.
It is hoped that this timely subject "Our Pioneer Heritage" has been and will be so thoroughly discussed that it will make an important contribution to the spirit of Utah's great Centennial, the prime purpose of which is to call to mind and to emphasize the deeds and accomplishments of the pioneers of Utah, and perpetuate their memories by music, song, and pageant, and by dedicating to the pioneers that mighty monument "This Is the Place."
"By their fruits ye shall know them." Yes, by the fruits of our noble pioneers we shall ever know and remember them.

The Story of Essentials Lesson |�Organization President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, October 7, 1947 Objective: To show the marvelous result of the God-inspired plan used by our pioneers in crossing the plains. NE of the distinguishing characteristics of Latter-day Saints is their understanding and appreciation of the efficacy of organized efforts and the importance of co-operation between individuals and _between groups. This understanding and knowledge is a heritage from the Church itself, the organization of which was divinely inspired. The perfect organization and operation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is ample evidence of its divine origin. The government of the Church is vested in the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve, assisted by other General Authorities, by general officers of various departments, and boards of auxiliary organizations. It is divided into stakes and missions and subdivided into wards and branches. The organization and work is thus built and set up on order, authority, love-inspired obedience, and co-operation, and operates with precision and efficiency. In making plans and preparations for crossing the plains, it was only natural that one of the first considerations should be the careful and proper organization of the companies, and it was largely due to the efforts in this direction that the LESSON DEPARTMENT companies were so successful. (See D. & C. 136). In his biography, pioneer Elijah Mayhew, who crossed the plains from Winter Quarters in 1853 and was one of the clerks of his company, shows how the company was carefully organized, and gives some interesting details regarding its organization and operation. He reports that the company consisted of 232 souls, seventy wagons, 125 horses, 360 head of cattle, and 126 sheep. Captains D. R. Miller and John Cooley were in command. The company was divided into groups of fifty, which were subdivided into groups of ten. Each group of fifty had a captain, a sergeant of guard, a chaplain, and a clerk. Following are the rules and regulations as recorded by him: 1�Camp will be called by the sound of a trumpet for prayer morning and evening. 2�Card playing will not be allowed. 3�Profane language will not be allowed. 4�Dogs must be tied up at night. 5�No noise nor confusion of any kind will be allowed after 8 p. M. 6�The horn will blow for arising at 4:30 a. M. 7�Assembly for prayers at 5:30 am. 8�Each man will assist in driving the cattle. O�The 491 horn will blow as notice to bring in the cattle. 10�The corral, formed by placing wagons side by side, will not be broken nor any wagon move from the yard in the morning until all the cattle are yoked. 11�The rate of travel for oxen, 3 miles per hour. The names of all individuals, he explains, were enrolled; and, for the company, he kept a daily diary. If additional individuals joined the company along the route, their names and the date of their arrival were kept. All accidents and troubles were recorded; for example, the accident of Lucy Ann Miller, in which her leg was broken but successfully set. Upon the arrival of the company in Salt Lake City, resolutions of respect and appreciation were drafted and presented to Captains Miller and Cooley for their kindness, efficient leader ship, wise counsel, and tender care. Suggestions for Discussion The class might be encouraged to add examples of how the Church, through its perfect organization, has been able, on short notice, to collect needed information, facts, and statistics, and to carry out necessary programs. Literature-Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants Elder H. Wayne Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1947-48 THE three-year series of Church history lessons brought to a close last May dealt with the theological study of the Doctrine and Covenants. It has been felt that some time could, with profit, be spent in enjoying this modern scripture from a literary point of view. Certain it is that many in the Relief Society have expressed the hope that time might be taken in a series of lessons on the literary values of the 492 Doctrine and Covenants. It is with this thought in mind that a year's course of study has been written in such a field. There are within the words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith a variety of literary forms. The literary values of the Doctrine and Covenants add joy to the gospel message given. To make a complete study of the literature of this modern scripture demands much time. In the present series of lessons in this field only the high lights of such a work may be outlined. It is hoped that such an outline will prove inviting for further study, and that much pleasure may be gained by reviewing the Passages of the Doctrine and Covenants in another light. The first lesson is introductory. Lesson 1. Introductory Lesson to "The Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants" Objective: To present a short historical account of the coming forth of the book the Doctrine and Covenants, and to call attention to the great work of the Prophet Joseph Smith as a revelator, and the necessity for Latter-day Saints to study the revelations. The lesson titles and objectives for the literature course to follow are: Lesson 2. Literary Values of the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the truth and beauty it contains. Lesson 3. Types of Literature Found In the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the various forms of literature contained in the revealed word of the Lord. Lesson 4. Epistles of the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the letters of the Prophet to the saints and the word of the Lord to the Prophet while a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri. Lesson 5. Prayers of the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the Prayers it contains, which are not unlike the lyric or song. Lesson 6. Visions of the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the apocalyptic type of lit. Literature. Lesson 7. Doctrinal Exposition ot the Doctrine and Covenants Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the wisdom contained in this modern scripture. Lesson 8, Appreciation Values in Doctrine and Covenants Reading Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the values to be received from the Lord's word. The writer is indebted to Dr. Sidney B. Sperry of
