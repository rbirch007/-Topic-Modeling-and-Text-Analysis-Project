covered wagons, the horsemen, the children, the cattle, and the dogs who followed in the train of the pioneers. On its east face there are six portrait statues of famous trail breakers, Kit Carson, General John C. Fremont, Captain Bonneville, Father de Smet, Peter Skeene Ogden, and the Indian Chief Washakie. Washakie was the chief of the Shoshone tribe and became a great friend of President Young. During his reign, not a single white man was molested by an Indian in his territory. At opposite ends of the monument stand two life-size groups, one depicting the Spanish missionaries who passed through what is now Utah, in 1776, with Father Escalante. The other shows the group of explorers and trappers who trekked over the land in 1825 under the leadership of William Henty Ashley of Virginia. A sixty foot pylon rises above the center of the monument. At its base are Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow who were sent ahead and who saw the Valley from the mouth of Emigration Canyon, July 21, and who cried out in their ecstasy, "Hosannah! Hosannah! Hosannah!" Mahonri Young's power to show action in his figures is exemplified MAHONRI M. YOUNG by his large plaque of the Donner party climbing the eastern slope of the Wasatch to the summit of Big Mountain whither they had been directed by Lansford Hastings. There was no trail, nor even a path to follow, nothing but thick underbrush and quaking aspen groves. From what is now Henefer in Weber Canyon, the party was nearly three weeks reaching the Valley through Emigration Canyon. One notes the overwhelming expression of physical fatigue which the sculptor gives to his men who are helping, as they can, the exhausted oxen. He has given free reign to his imagination. The work is big with fatefulness. The mountain heights must be won. On, on the men tug at the 443 topes as the oxen bend to their yokes. At the top of the pylon are the bronze figures of President Bigham Young, Heber C. Kimball and Wilford Woodruff. The expression on the face of Brigham Young, as he places his right hand on the arm of Heber C. Kimball, is one of awe and thanksgiving, as he sees the beautiful Valley before him. The three characters are under the spell of the morning light, and they stand there in amazement, chastened, purified, elevated, drawn closer to each other by the realization that they have reached their destination. God had truly led them to the promised land. Mahonri Young lives in Ridgefield, Conn. He works steadily on THE DONNER PARTY Plaque from "This Is the Place" Monument by Mahonri M. Young The Donner Party, bound for California, left Fort Bridger, Wyoming, July 28, 1846, and passed through Salt Lake Valley. There were eighty-seven people in the company. Thirty-nine perished in the snow of the high Sierras, near Lake Tahoe. 444 to achieve what he set out to do in his youth. His ideal is to express in art the many fine historic events characteristic of the West. Always looking forward, he moves in a world of exaltation. He loves nature. He is ever studying human nature. He finds in man a power divine, and with ardent faith and warmth of enthusiasm, he makes the divine idea a living reality. It is his love of work alone, his labor without respite, which gives him joy. As an example of energy, a source of force and beauty, he will always, as long as he lives, be a radiant ideal to follow. An American through and through, depicting the lives of the pioneers to Utah and the far West, he has established himself as an artist who knows the ideals of America, and the influence of those ideals he has worked out in his art. He has truthfully said: "A country which forgets its past history, will never have a future worth remembering." S this article concerning the life and work of Mahonri Young goes to press, news reaches us announcing the death of his beloved wife, Dorothy Weir. She, too, was an artist and well known in her native state, Connecticut. Her father, J. Alden Weir, was a famous portrait painter, and his father founded the School of Fine Arts at Yale University. Dorothy Weir was born in the beautiful old home at Ridgefield, and there she had lived all her life, with the exception of times spent in Europe studying art. She was an exceptionally fine water colorist, with a clear, decisive style. After her marriage she and her husband made one of the old barns on the estate into a studio, and, there he created the "This Is the Place" Monument, to be unveiled this month of July. She often came to Salt Lake City, where she made many friends. Her brilliant career was arrested in its meridian by a sudden stroke of fate, for death took her at the moment when Mahonri had attained his triumph after years of hard work. The loveliness of her disposition, the gentleness of her spirit, the radiance of her cheerfulness which she always diffused, will ever be recalled by her many friends and relatives who knew and loved her. Mahonni's grief will be assuaged by the knowledge of the teachings he received in his boyhood days in the little home on C Street in the Twentieth Ward of Salt Lake City, and by the memory of the many days of serene joy when, in golden afternoons, he and his wife walked in the woods near their home.
