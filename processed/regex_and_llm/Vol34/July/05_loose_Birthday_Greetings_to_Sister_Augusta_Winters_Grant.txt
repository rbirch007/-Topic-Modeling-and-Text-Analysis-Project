Birthday Greetings to Sister Augusta Winters Grant ONE would hardly think, to look at this latest picture of Sister Grant, that the ninety-first anniversary of her birth occurs on July 7 of this year. But such is indeed the 0 case. There are many reasons why the years have passed lightly over Sister Grant, one of which is exemplified by the accompanying picture. Through the years she has been given love and respect and support by the wives of the General Authorities of the Church. It was not long after her husband, President Heber J. Grant, became head of the Church that the wife of one of the General Authorities suggested an organization of all the wives, for, said she, "If we become better acquainted and more united we shall strengthen each other in upholding the ideals for which our husbands stand. Thus we shall strengthen them." This congenial group meets once a month in the historic Lion House where a mod-est luncheon is served and an informal program is enjoyed. On April 3, 1947, Sister Ballard, wife of the late Melvin J. Ballard, member of the Quorum of the Twelve, acted as hostess. She chose to make Sister Grant guest of honor on that day. "In all the years that Sister Grant has been our presiding officer never once has she put herself above us or ever hurt anyone's feelings," said Sister Ballard. "I was her pupil as a young girl and of all the women who ever crossed my path I dreamed of being like her." Sister Jennette Evans McKay, wife of President David O. McKay, related incidents concerning Sister Grant's pioneer girlhood, her school-teaching days, and her characteristics in later life. Now, on her ninety-first birthday, Augusta Winters Grant is serene and unafraid, for she views life, not as something detached and apart, but as belonging to a well-defined pattern which will persist. Page 451 Pioneer Stories and Incidents PIONEER WOMEN President Amy Brown Lyman [This is the tenth in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by Thein honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration �Ed.] ONE hundred years ago this month the pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley. With the group of brave and courageous men who entered the Valley, there were nine brave and courageous women. Three of these women had accompanied the original band of pioneers from Winter Quarters, leaving there April 16, 1847, and the other six women were members of the company of Mississippi saints who had wintered in Pueblo, Colorado, and joined the pioneer company on June 1, at Fort Laramie, and journeyed into the Valley with Brigham Young's company. The three women who journeyed from Winter Quarters were Harriet Page Wheeler Young, age forty-four years, wife of Lorenzo D. Young, who brought with her two children, both boys; Clara Decker Young, age nineteen, her daughter, wife of Brigham Young; and Ellen Sanders Kimball, age twenty-three, wife of Heber C. Kimball. Ellen was a Norwegian, born at Thelemarken, Norway, and she and Hans Christian Hansen were the only Scandinavians in the company. The six women of the Mississippi Company were Elizabeth Crow, aged fifty-two years, and her five daughters: Martilla Jane Therlkell, who had a small son; Harriet Crow, Elizabeth J. Crow, and Isa Vinda, Page 452 and Ira Minda Crow, twins. The Mississippi Company was composed of a group of Latter-day Saints from Monroe County, Mississippi, who, at the request of President Brigham Young, had been organized to accompany the pioneers to Utah. It was expected at that time that the pioneer journey would be made in 1846, and this Southern group was directed to meet them on the plains. The call by the Government on June 26, 1846, for the Mormon Battalion to assist in the Mexican War changed the plans; but the Mississippi saints were already on their way, having left their homes on April 8. When they were a few miles south of Fort Laramie, they met a company from California who told them there were no Mormon companies on the route ahead of them, so, on July 10, they decided to go south to Pueblo for the winter and wait there to hear something definite about the main body of the Church, and there they remained for one year. On July 29, just five days after President Brigham Young entered the Valley, the number of pioneer women was increased with the arrival of a group of saints from Pueblo, including a number of Mormon Battalion families and the remainder of the Mississippi Company. Outstanding among these women PIONEER STORIES AND INCIDENTS was Mary Black Brown, wife of Captain James Brown of Mormon Battalion fame. She had married Captain Brown at Council Bluffs on July 16, the day the Government drafted five hundred men for the war with Mexico, and accompanied him on the long, hard journey across the plains. She washed and mended the clothing of the men in her husband's contingent, and when a number of the Battalion were sent to Pueblo under Captain Brown on sick leave, she helped to nurse and care for them there. Her baby girl was born three months after her arrival in Salt Lake Valley. The family of Captain James Brown was the first Mormon pioneer family to settle in Ogden, and here Mary Brown helped in the pioneering of that city. She was known as the first cheese maker in Utah. * Ke OK URING the summer and autumn of 1847, thirteen companies, made up of 2,095 individuals, entered the Valley (Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church, III:301). Among the interesting women who came that autumn, were Eliza R. Snow, later General President of Relief Society, and M. Isabella Horne, later General Treasurer of Relief Society, whose diaries give interesting glimpses of their experiences. Sister Snow left Winter Quarters June 15, and arrived in Salt Lake Valley October 6. President Young had made arrangements for Eliza R. Snow to live with his wife Clara Decker Young in her log room eighteen feet square, roofed with willows and earth. In her Sketch of My Life, Sister Snow records: 453 We suffered no inconvenience until the middle of March, when a long storm of snow, sleet, and rain occurred, and then for several days the sun did not make its appearance. Mrs. Clara Young happened to be on a visit to her mother... Sally, an Indian girl who had been purchased from a tribe by which she was held captive, was with me. The roof of our dwelling was covered deeper with earth than the adjoining ones, consequently did not leak as soon, and some of my neighbors huddled in for shelter.... After they left, Sally wrapped herself in her buffalo robe on the floor, and I spread my umbrella over my head and shoulders as I ensconced myself in bed, the lower part being unshielded, was wet enough before morning. During the night, despite all discomfiture, I laughed involuntarily while alone in the darkness I lay reflecting on the ludicrous scene. The earth overhead being fully saturated, after it commenced to drip, the storm was much worse inside than out, and as the water coursed through the willows and pattered on the floor, washed the stones from the earth above, and they went clink, clink, while the numerous mice which the storm had driven in for shelter, ran squealing back and forth�the Indian girl asleep on the floor, altogether made the situation rather romantic (, page 314). Mrs. M. Isabella Horne wrote: In June, 1847, the saints were organized into companies to follow the pioneers, and I was with the first company that left Winter Quarters. The trials, hardships and privations that the people of God endured on that long and weary journey were great and can only be understood by those who experienced them.... When our pilgrimage was over we found ourselves in a barren waste, inhabited by Indians, Utah. But we were glad to find a resting place where we could worship God without fearing our enemies were coming upon us. The weather was favorable for building, and the brethren immediately began to saw logs and erect small log houses, into which many of us moved, without having either doors, windows, or floors. Here again there were many difficulties 454 to overcome. The ground was full of snakes which used to crawl around and into our houses. 'The timber was so full of bugs that it was years before they were entirely subdued. 'The mice also were very numerous, running over us by day and night, and destroying considerable clothing, etc., which caused inconvenience and trouble. We were also obliged to live on short rations, digging roots to add to our store, in order to make our supplies last until something could be raised for food. During that winter many of the Mormon Battalion arrived, and we were under the necessity of sharing our food with them. We could put a little grease into a dish with a rag in it to make a light, and parch a little wheat to make a warm drink, but when it came to making soap, we were put to our wit's end to get material to make enough to do our washing. I well remember the first harvest home we celebrated. Apostle Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor called upon the sisters to prepare a feast. 'They prepared what food they could from their meagre store and set a long table in the Fort. Although the food was plain and everything was done in a humble way, our hearts flowed with thanksgiving to our Heavenly Father for the blessings conferred upon us. Our table decorations were sheaves of wheat and other things that had been raised.... I can hardly tell today how we did succeed. But the Lord opened our way and blessed us with cheerful, contented spirits and thankful hearts. Dr. Charles W. Elliott, President of Harvard University, in an address in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on March 17, 1892, paid the following tribute to pioneer women: Did it ever occur to you what is the most heroic part of planting a colony of people which moves into a wilderness to establish a civilized community? You think, perhaps, it is the soldier, the armed man, or the laboring man. Not so; it is the women who are the most heroic part of any new colony. Their labors are the less because their strength is less. Their anxieties are greater, their dangers greater, the risks they run are heavier. We read that story in the history of the Pilgrim and Puritan colonies of Massachusetts. The women died faster than the men; they suffered more. Perhaps their reward was greater, too. They bore children to the colony. Let us bear in our hearts veneration for the women of any Christian folk going out in the wilderness to plant a new community (Deseret Evening News, March 17, 1892).
