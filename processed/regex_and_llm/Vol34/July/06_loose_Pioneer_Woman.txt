PIONEER WOMAN Alice Morrey Bailey They say she wept when first she saw the land That swept unbroken to the salten sea, The unfenced sage, the single cedar tree� The shimmering heat strained taut the last frail strand Of her endurance. Wagon-choking sand Seemed bitter lot�too hard the stern decree Of wilderness�too close in memory The empty homes of this long-driven band. Yet, pulse with his, she caught each growing surge Of hope, and stretched her courage famine-thin To bear new life, to span the cricket scourge. She bent her strength to nourish, teach, and spin, And made her faith in God a moving stream To gird the spires and temples of man's dream.
