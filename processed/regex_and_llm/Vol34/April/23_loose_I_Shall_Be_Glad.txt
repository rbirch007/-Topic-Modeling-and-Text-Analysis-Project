I SHALL BE GLAD Jeanette P. Parry I shall be glad when spring unfolds her tapestries And daffodils sway down the garden walks; I shall be glad when meadow larks wake up the dawn And strutting robins give their courtship talks. I shall be glad when men, as brothers on the earth, Help guard the lambs within the shepherd's flock. When all the dormant earth pulsates with eager life, And cripples lay their crutches down and walk. It is not new, life from seeming death emerging. This constant challenge of the budding spring; He who gave his life upon the cross of Calvary, Now reigns supreme as Master, Lord, and King.
