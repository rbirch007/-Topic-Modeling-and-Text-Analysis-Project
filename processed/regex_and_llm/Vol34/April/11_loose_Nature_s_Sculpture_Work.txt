NATURE'S SCULPTURE WORK Photograph by Philip W. Tompkins 237 THE GORGE OF THE COLORADO NEAR THE CROSSING OF THE FATHERS and they reach their climax in the Wasatch Range, rising sharply across the center of Utah. Moisture-laden clouds cross Nevada and Western Utah, but when they try to rise above the higher Wasatch Mountains they become cool and can no longer hold their moisture, and there is rain. Most of the water which falls on the Wasatch Mountains drains to the westward, down into Utah Valley and Salt Lake Valley and Cache Valley, making of these valleys Utah's greatest agricultural regions. Utah Valley, in fact, is rated first in many aspects of agriculture, not only in the State of Utah but in the entire Rocky Mountain region, as well. This rating is given by the United States Department of Agriculture. Thus the mountains make the water available, which, in turn, helps to produce sufficient food to support a large population. Industries are attracted partly by the available water supply, and partly by the labor supply. So, mother nature wisely pushed up the high Wasatch Mountains. If it were not so, the moisture-laden clouds would have crossed the entire State to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, and all of Utah would have been a vast desert, as incapable of supporting a large population as is Nevada. MOTHER nature has pushed up other mountains in the State. Along another fault line, the Uintah Mountains were pushed up, one of the few east-west ranges of mountains in the United States. And in the southeastern part of Utah are the Abajo (Blue), the La Sal, and the Henry Mountains,  known as mushroom mountains. They were pushed up above the surrounding land by the pressure of hot molten rock underneath. The molten rock failed to escape, and so the mountains never became active volcanoes; they just swelled up like a wart on the earth's already scarred But they are important, extremely important, to the sheepmen, the cattlemen, and the farmers scattered about their feet. They furnish good summer range and some irrigation water, although their value as watersheds is greatly limited by their size. They furnish beauty and a relief from the harsh surrounding deserts. And they furnish some timber. All the eastern and the southern parts of the State are drained by the Colorado River, and a great part of it is known as the Colorado Plateau. This plateau is a huge elevated plain, comprising almost half of Utah and a large part of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. It stands from 4,000 to 11,000 feet above sea level and covers an area of 130,000 square miles. Actually, the Colorado Plateau is not just one plateau but a great many, all standing at different elevations. This area was once at a much lower elevation than it is today, and it has been gradually pushed up, or elevated, to its present height. And as this took place, the river dug deeper and deeper until, today, it has dug a distance of 6,000 feet from the rim of Grand Canyon to the bottom. And it is still digging. It is perhaps easier to understand just what a river can do when we consider the Mount Carmel highway in Zion Canyon National Park. The highway was tunneled along the face of the cliff for almost a mile. At frequent intervals windows were cut as lookouts. Actually, these windows were cut first, and all the debris from them and from the tunnel was dropped down into Pine Creek at the base of the ledge. Pine Creek is usually no more than a trickle, but it took it only two months to remove all the debris, carrying it on down towards the Virgin River and, finally, to the Colorado. This, of course, was the result of "flash floods," which come off bare rocks and dry desert land with express-like speed. These same washes and creeks, which are known for their "flash floods," are usually dry for most of the year, carrying water only after heavy rains and during the early spring runoff. Then, consider what a river like the Colorado can do with constant and persistent effort. And, while considering this, think of Zion Canyon where the little North Fork of the Virgin River has cut a gash in the solid stone nearly 2,500 feet deep. But cutting deep and nigged canyons isn't the only thing mother nature can do using running water for a tool. Fifty-one miles west of Blanding is the Natural Bridges National Monument. Here are three natural bridges carved from solid stone, having spans which vary from 186 feet to 261 feet, and openings from ninety-three feet to 222 feet in height. Near the Arizona border and close to the Colorado, is the Rainbow Natural Bridge, which has a span of 275 feet and arches 308 feet above the canyon floor. In the Wayne Wonderland, and all along the tributaries of the Colorado, mother nature has carved these and other gigantic bridges. Photograph by Willard Luce LOCOMOTIVE ROCK AT BLUFF, UTAH All of them have been made in the same manner. Water, wearing for ages against a wall of stone, eventually wears the wall through. Loose debris from the top continues to fall, and the opening is slowly enlarged until the bridge is finally complete. So it has been with these bridges. OUT, it was in the multicolored limestone of Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks that mother nature carved a masterpiece. Working in the modern and fantastic surrealism of Salvador Dali, she carved out huge amphitheaters, leaving in them grotesque and weird figures, spires and temples, bridges and arches, all splattered with brilliant hues of red, pink, cream, and many other colors. Here, again, water did the carving, water and eternal patience. True, the frosts and winds helped some-what, but mainly it was the water, wearing savagely at the walls after each rainstorm, and with the melting of e ach snow. The soft material was washed away first, except where it was protected by a cap of harder stone. And where it was so protect-ed, the surrounding material was washed away, leaving towers and pinnacles standing straight and tall like shepherds watching their flocks. Although slower, wind has some-times been an even better tool than water in carving and sculpturing the land. This is especially so in many arid desert regions where rains are few and far between. Such a region is the Arches National Monument near Moab, Utah. Here, in an area of 33,680 acres, the wind has worn eighty-one arches in the solid red sandstone. At one time this area was a solid sheet of sand- NATURE'S SCULPTURE WORK 241 stone hundreds of feet thick. For some reason, the sandstone became cut by two series of master joints or cracks. These cracks passed through the entire thickness of the stone. They occurred about twenty feet apart, and crossed each other at right angles. At this stage, water was more important than wind. It seeped into the cracks, dissolving the cementing material and gradually increasing the cracks until they became great fissures between two huge slabs of sandstone. These slabs are known as "fins." Today, these fins are of-ten no thicker than twenty feet, and still they stand from 100 to 200 feet in the air, and the cracks between them are often too narrow for a man to squeeze through. It is in these fins that the arches are formed. With an infinite patience, mother nature has worked with wind and with grains of sand, hurling the sand against the fin time and time again until, finally, the fin is worn through. And, after that, the wind and the sand continue their work, and the arch grows. Within this area, the arches vary from a mere peephole to the Landscape Arch, which is the longest natural span in the world� 290 feet. Yes, mother nature has done well with her sculpturing, and over it all she has sown the Joshua and the mesquite, the sage and the grease-wood, the Indian paintbrush and the bluebell, the cedar and the spruce, the limber pine and the al-pine buttercup. And, of course, the sego lily.

THE four-day trip from Chicago to Southern New Mexico had been, for the Martin family, as much a journey into the unknown as any pioneer journey fifty years be- fore. The old Ford had rattled and wheezed and, at times, stopped altogether. The canvas-covered trailer, piled high with furniture, had bounced along behind, and swung perilously around corners. In the car, boxes and suitcases barely left room for John and Ellen, in the front seat, and the two children, Betty, eight, and Johnny, five, in the back. As they neared the place on which they had put almost their entire savings as a down payment, sight un-seen, Ellen's excitement grew. This was the place in the country that she had dreamed about and planned for all her married life. Here Betty would grow strong and well, and John would lose the nagging cough which had kept him at home so much the past winter. Finally, as they passed some tall roadside bushes, John exclaimed, 'There it is! See the name Larson on the mail box." He stopped the car, and they all leaned out to look. "Let me see," Johnny cried, pushing his sister aside. "Where are the clucks? I want to see the pond and the ducks." "Will there be a horse to ride?" Betty asked. No one answered them. Page 242 Ellen gasped, "But this can't be the place!" Part of the front fence was down; the low frame house, back among some trees, was unpainted and two windows were broken. The grass in front was yellow, and the weeds along the driveway were waist high. "Why, the ad said in good condition. Oh, John! What if we've made a mistake? " All the way across the country, Ellen had entertained the children with stories of the Wisconsin farm to which her mother had taken her when she was ten. The rest of her twenty-seven years she had lived in a Chicago tenement district of narrow streets and murky atmosphere. It was not surprising, then, that the farm had remained in her memory as being in perpetual springtime. The fields were always green, the trees in blossom, lambs played in the pasture, and tiny pigs squealed from their pen. Even John, who had always considered Chicago a good enough place to live, had become infected by her enthusiasm. He had teased, "You must have had a glimpse in to heaven, once ."The place they were looking at bore not the slightest resemblance to anything Ellen's stories had led them to expect. John opened the gate and drove slowly up the driveway. When he stopped by the back porch, he said, A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY 243 laughingly, as he opened the car door for the children, "I bet your mother thought the fairies would have the house all spick and span for us. I bet she expected to pull radishes for supper." Betty's blue eyes, so like her father's, laughed back at him and a smile flitted across Johnny's chubby, tired little face. Then to Ellen he said, "You know, honey, a house not lived in goes down pretty fast. I can soon fix it up. I'm a better carpenter than I am farmer, you know." When she continued to stare at the house, he said, "But first I bet-ter see if the well's as good as that agent assured me it was." As he got a bucket from the trailer, and started for the pump, he began to cough. A cold fear gripped Ellen' s heart. What if that works should be too hard for John? What if he should miss the city and never let her know that he longed to go back. Buying a farm had been her own idea, really. Maybe the rest of them wouldn't be happy here, at all. The creaking of the pump seemed the saddest sound she had ever heard. SHE walked slowly to the back door, unlocked it, and looked in. A musty, unclean smell rushed at her. When her eyes became ac-customed to the dimness, she saw a rusty range in one corner. The breeze from the open door lifted a heap of soot from the fallen stove-pipe and drifted it across the floor. A startled mouse scampered over some scattered papers and disappeared through a hole in the base-board. When the children came up be-hind her, Ellen shut the door hurriedly and said, with forced cheer-fulness, "We'll cook our supper in the yard. We'll sleep under the trees. We'll really camp out. Won't that be fun ?"As they followed her back to the car, she advised Betty, "You take Johnny to see the orchard. See if you can find some flowers." Soon she had a small fire burning in the driveway. Then she got the food box from the car, spread a cloth on the ground nearby, and set out some bright pottery dishes. John came with the water. "See," he said, "it's clear and cold." Ellen took a drink. "Yes, it's fine." She dipped some into a kettle and put it over the fire to boil for the eggs. She opened a can of tomatoes and unwrapped cheese and bread. She found some paper napkins and a clean bib for Johnny. She should have bought milk in the last town, but she had been too anxious to get to the farm to remember. Oh, well, water would do this once, she supposed. John took the canvas from the trailer, and spread it under a tree. He got mattresses and bedding and made the beds. Then he gathered dry branches and stacked them near the fire. As they worked, a quiet settled down on the countryside. It was broken only by the occasional low mooing of a cow, or the sleepy chirping of a robin. Both John and Ellen stopped in surprise. This was some-thing they h ad never experienced be-fore. They had never been where there were no honking cars, blaring radios, and footsteps over their heads.  
Ellen looked around. "The neighbors are just far enough away to make every call seem a real visit," she said. "I wonder if they have stiles. I've always wanted to walk across a field and over a stile to the neighbors. People in the country are so friendly�not always hurried and nervous, like city people."
John came to stand beside her. "You must have read a book," he teased.
The children came running back, shouting something about cherries and green apples. Betty had a bunch of dandelions and Johnny a hat year's bird's nest. When Betty handed her mother the flowers, she stood in awe, pointing to the west. "What is it, a fire?"
They all turned. A brilliant red sun was just touching the distant mountain peaks. Shafts, like flames tipped with gold, rose from it and extended both ways along the horizon. Fleecy clouds, whose undersides were tinged with pink, floated above.
"I've seen such sunsets on picture postcards," Ellen whispered, "but I never believed them, real."
John put his arm around her and the children drew close. Then they stood, scarcely moving, till the sun was gone and swift twilight settled down, obliterating all that was old and unlovely.
"It's all right," Ellen said slowly, as she moved back to the fire and began to serve the supper. "It's beautiful. Everything's beautiful." (To be continued)
