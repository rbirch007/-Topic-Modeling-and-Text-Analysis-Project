The information has been carefully gleaned from diaries, journals, and personal interviews. Ed.] Synopsis: A company of twenty-four young men and two families � James L. Davis, his wife Mary, and their four children; Henry H. Harriman, his wife Elizabeth, and their five children � are called to explore a route from Cedar City, in Southern Utah, to San Juan County, Utah. The two families are to remain in San Juan and, at a point where the Montezuma Creek comes into the San Juan River, are to establish an outpost and prepare for the coming of the main company of settlers, members of the San Juan Mission. The twenty-four scouts are to re-turn to their homes and report their findings. The purpose of the mission is to cultivate and maintain peaceful and friendly relations with the Indians, who are almost the sole occupants of the large isolated country. While driving her team at night, across a sultry, menacing desert, Elizabeth has a frightening experience with a strange, mysteriously inexplicable Indian. Elizabeth is told to say nothing of her experience. She complies, but has the feeling that she will see the Indian again and that he will know if she needs help. The company goes on toward the Colorado River. At Lee's Hogback there is an accident to one of the wagons, which careens from the ridge, and its two drivers and their goods go rolling down the steep ledge. 44 OLD the line! Keep moving!" Silas Smith shout- IT ed. "George, keep 'em on the move or we'll all go over!" "No one is hurt!" George cried. "The men are already cutting the teams free of their harnesses. Don't look down! Keep moving, straight to the top!" Page 254 "Ever)' man to the front who is not driving a team," Silas ordered. "Hold the wagons on the trail by hand! We can't lose another out-fit!" Alternately urging and commanding, the two leaders succeeded in holding the line till the last wag-on reached the top of the spiked divide. There, five men were de-tailed to help get the broken wagon and the crippled teams back up the sliding ledge. The other men had held the wagons to the road by sheer force of numbers and de-termination. And then it was over. The ridge flattened out, its sides plumed up and slid away into the desert. The mammoth hog had reclined, needing no shade and no water for its rest. Once over the hogback, Elizabeth and Mary climbed wearily from their wagons and lifted their young-er children down beside them. "Lee's Hogback!" Mary exclaimed, and stood staring back at it. "Let it lie!" Elizabeth said curtly. "We have work to do! The children are clamoring for food, and the whole camp needs rest and water." "Water!" Mary exclaimed, "I'd give a bucket of gold for a drop of "George says we can only stop an hour, Mary. The sun is getting low and we have miles to go before we 'night camp' at Bitter Springs." Elizabeth was systematically arranging utensils and food for a quick meal for the men, and as she talked she worked rapidly. Mary spoke uneasily, "Oh, Elizabeth, what if there shouldn't be any water when we get to Bitter Springs." Elizabeth paused in her work to look at Mary. "Why, we'd just die, I guess," she said. "But the Lord has seen us over that place," she flung a defiant glance back at the hogback, "and my opinion is that he'll keep on lookin' after us. This is a mission. You remember in the Book of Mormon when Nephi and his brothers Laman, Lemuel, and Sam were sent back to Jerusalem to get the records from King Laban, Nephi Photograph by Walter P. Cottam 255 said: 'I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for 1 know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them." "That is good scripture," Mary agreed, and added emphatically, "the main company had better read that passage. They're going to need that kind of faith if they accomplish the thing they have been commanded _ "Do you wish we could have stayed to come with the main company?" Elizabeth asked, not looking at her friend and almost ashamed of the implied weakness. "Of course, I do," Mary answered. MONOLITH IN THE DESERT 256 Courtesy, Jen Dike Studio, Phoenix, Arizona NAVAJO SHEPHERDESS "I don't think the Lord will blame us, either. Someone has to go so it may as well be us. The men seem to tackle a job better if there are women along to fight for." Elizabeth said affectionately, "I wouldn't worry so if you weren't going to have a baby, Mary. You never have been strong." "That worried me at first, too, Elizabeth. But I'm getting stronger every day." And so they talked, snatching moments between their cooking, looking after each other's children, laughing at remembered things back home.... Twas midnight before they reached Bitter Springs. The brackish water did little to relieve their thirst, but they drank it and went to bed, exhausted, on the hot sand. Dawn comes early to the desert. The sun comes up, not leisurely as if it had rested well, but blazing wrathfully, discomfited by its bed of prickly-pears and sand. Tall cactus trees, brittle-looking as the rays of the sun, stretch their limbs and stand in resignation. With their thirst but bitterly satisfied, the heat soon became intolerable to the weary train which had started traveling before daybreak. The children cried and tossed fitfully from side to side in their rocking wagons. Long before noon the cattle were bawling their discontent, lowing dismally to their scattered calves. 'The horses were white with caked lather, and sweat and sand rimmed the bloodshot eyes of the men. But in spite of it all, they made thirty miles that day� only to find a dry camp that night. The next morning there was the same sun, the same blistering wind, the same hot sand in their eyes. And they had to go another thirty miles, without water, for the next spring had been dry. The cattle, tongues lolling and eyes bulging, refused to take another step and gave up beside the road, only struggling up and on again at the merciless prodding of the drovers, and then some of them falling dead a little farther along the way. Up and down the sluggish line rode George Hobbs and Silas Smith. "George, we've gone sixty miles without water," Silas cried. "A fourth of our stock is dead, and the men and women are but little better. What are we going to do?" "There's nothing to do but hold on and keep moving!" George yelled at the line: "Only ten miles more, and we'll roll in water! Keep moving! Keep movin Stoical g!" in the face of it, Elizabeth and Mary drove behind their men. Ten miles . . . nine . . . eight . . . and, at last, only one more mile. Water! Water! They prayed. The spring could not, must not be dry! The first men to reach Willow Spring sent up a shout and, almost Here is the exact OCR transcription of the text:
before their own thirst was satisfied, they began to fill their barrels, buckets, pans, and cups to take back to the parched ram in the rear. Some of the boys, laughing wryly, even filled their hats with the precious water and went staggering back to help their friends.
An hour later, half dead, the company pulled up at the spring. Night, drenched with unexpected dew, cooled their veins and healed their eyes with sleep. . . .
At the Indian village of Moenkopi President Smith was warned that his company would never be permitted to cross the Navajo Indian Reservation into San Juan. Hobbs, too, had been advised to turn back. They had met at a blacksmith's shop to pool their crews.
"They say it can't be done, Silas," George drawled, whittling away at a stick.
"Never mind what they say! What do you say?" Silas questioned hotly.
"I say it can," Hobbs replied, setting himself cross-legged in the shade of a squawbush near the shop. "But, Silas, we've got ten teams to shoe yet. The confounded Indians are slow as sorghum in winter. We've paid 'em in corn and shirts, now they want shoes and pants. They'll keep us here all summer!"
"Well, give 'em shoes and pants then, George."
"Whose, besides mine?"
Silas' eyes twinkled. "I used to warn 'em, buckskins," he said. "And where we're goin' there's not enough rain to worry about them shrinking." Then, serious again, he ground a rock to bits beneath his heel. "Give 'em any bloomin' thing they want, only let's get out of here!"
"I talked with John W. Young,"
George reported. "He's been here a good many months trying to build a woolen mill. So far he's met nothing but opposition all the way. He has Indians here are used to the whites, but, once we cross into San Juan, we'll be in their territory and they'll fight us every step of the way."
"We knew that when we started out, George. And I can't say that I blame the Indians. They haven't forgotten the drubbing they got from Kit Carson and the Government. And, furthermore, it is still fresh in their minds that the whites have just killed four of their young men."
"The white men who were responsible for that were not Latter-day Saints, Silas."
"That will make little difference to the Indians," Silas answered. "With them, it's still an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
"Well," George drawled, "Brigham Young was famous for goin' where folks said he couldn't. I reckon he told me! like to hear a son of his say that a call of the Church can't be fulfilled."
Mr. Young spoke sincerely. George. He firmly believes that we'll not get twenty miles inland from the river."
"Have you talked with Brother Wilford Woodruff, Silas?"
"Yes. He came to my camp last night and brought some missionaries with him. They are to preach to the Indians and help us out."
"Good! We'll take them right up to old Chief Peegarrent and introduce them to him," George said.
Silas smiled. "We can use the missionaries, all right. But what we need right now, George, is grain and wagon parts."

George reminded him that there were no wagon parts, and precious little grain in Moenkopi. "But there is wool," *he added. "Could we use any of that?" "Wool makes good pads for horses' sore shoulders, George. Take that and anything else you can get around here." Silas sat down beside George in the scant shade of a squawbush. "I'm worried, George," he admitted. "There are plenty of white trappers and traders who would stir up trouble around here, even if the Indians were inclined to be peaceable." George poked a deep hole in the sand with his forefinger. He picked a centipede off his sleeve and dropped it into the hole. "Yep. They're as poison as that critter I just buried," he declared, tamping the sand into the hole with angry jabs. They were silent for a minute and then George continued, "I've been thinking about Mrs. Davis, Silas." "We'd better leave the Davises here, George," Silas replied. "And leave Mrs. Harriman to take care of Mrs. Davis?" "No. We have to have one woman along to help keep the hotheads in check. They are itchin' to start shootin' as it is." "T guess you're right, Silas, but it will be hard on the woman. I'll see that the Davises are taken care of here. And we'd better leave the stock here, too. We'll have enough to do to look after our own hides." "That's the size of it," Silas agreed. "The sooner we hit the trail the better, too. The hardships of travel. Road building, and well digging 259 will help to keep dissatisfaction down." The two men rose and shook hands, then each went his own particular way, George to get the outfits in shape for the rough roads ahead, and Silas to procure funds and food for his men. To a woman there is no greater loneliness than being alone with a crowd of men, even when a husband and brothers are along. Women afford each other kinship that the company of men does not supply. Elizabeth helped Mary get settled in the large tent that the men had put up, and everything she did - showed her solicitude. She made beds, cooked, and sewed, and left a blessing with each one of the homely tasks. Tears often welled in Mary's eyes as she lay on her bed and watched Elizabeth's deft hands. "I'll miss you, Mary," Elizabeth confessed. 'The last task was finished. There was nothing more to do but talk as casually as they could and pretend to have the courage expected of them. Mary could not say goodbye to Elizabeth. "It's not goodbye, it's adios," she said bravely. "I'll be joining you soon. James says it will only be a few weeks." Elizabeth agreed, smiling for Mary's benefit. But she had a disquieting sense that things would never be the same with them again. Once they reached their destination, each one would settle on her own land and their houses might be miles apart. She would see Mary again, that was practically sure, but it would be different. They would never be as close to each other in the new settlement as they had been 260 while traveling to get there. But whatever came, she promised herself, she would always love Mary and pray that their two lives might go on together. FOR two uneventful days the company drove over drab desert sand, making ten miles each day. Nothing unusual happened;' then, suddenly, fear was all around them. It was nothing they could see or hear or touch, yet it was there. It followed the train in shadow by day and stalked it by night. This was a country of such vast silences that the small noises of the wheels as they churned the sand, were distracting. The creak of leather and chain was cymballed against the towering cliffs, as the wagons were catapulted from table land to canyon bottom, adding to the fear and the mystery of the unknown. "We are surrounded, Silas," George Hobbs said grimly, riding beside Silas, his eyes straight ahead. "They have been gathering for days. Ever since the first three miles out." "Indians?" Silas asked, showing no surprise. "I guess that's what I've been smelling. Our own campfire smells could hardly carry that strong." They rode in silence again, keeping close watch on all sides. Presently Silas spoke. "Where do you suppose those four scouts we sent out are keeping themselves? I should have had a report of this gathering. If there is an ambush�" "There won't be," George interrupted. "Chief Peogament hasn't joined his tribes yet. He knows what the water layout is, and he figures the rain gods will take care of us and save him the trouble. His hordes are following us to pick our bones." An hour later the train climbed out of the canyon and came to a sudden halt. Not more than fifty feet from the mouth of the canyon a forest of greasewood blocked their way. Miles wide, dense as fog, gnarled, and as twisted and tangled as the tentacles of an octopus, it confronted the astonished company. "T calculate that Peogament's got more on his side than his rain gods," Silas decided, stopping dead in his tracks. "I reckon we're here for some time. We had better start digging a well." George's eyes were glued to the thicket. He sat his horse erect and watchful. "It doesn't look promising," he agreed curtly. "There is double meaning in your words, George. What do you see?" "A thicket," George answered. "What do you see?" "A thicket," Silas replied, nettled out of his usual good-natured drawl. "A very deep thicket!" The company pulled up beside its leaders, staring incredulously at the forest. "Whatever that forest holds is its own secret now," Silas said, looking at George for enlightenment. But he got no response. "Make camp!" he shouted. "And pull in close together. Guards out!" Elizabeth covered her face with her hands. "I'm glad you are not here, Mary," she whispered to the great stretches of broken country that lay between her present dark camp and the warmth and security of Mary's tent. "I'm glad you are not here, waiting for what the night, or the dawn, or tomorrow's dawn may bring!" (To be continued) THE PRESS V IEWS MORMONISM AS A ZIONIST MOVEMENT Elder James R. Clark Brigham Young University Copyright 1947 (Third installment of a series of articles survey of some three thou; sand newspaper articles writ ten about the Latter-day Saints between 1824 and 1850, shows that editors and writers were interested in Mormonism for the sons that widely differed. Some editors were concerned only with the political aspects of Mormonism; others were concerned with the social and economic implications of the movement, still others seemed to delight only in vituperation an religious controversy. There is one recurring theme, however, that appears in newspaper be expressed as "Mormons take over." Newspaper editors seemed to have a firm conviction that the Latter-day Saints were attempting to "take over" America as their Zion, and the repeated publication of this conviction preceded the main body of Latter-day Saints 0" their westward journey from New York to Ohio, Ohio to Missouri, Missouri to Illinois, and even to California. Preceding them, it temper ed the thinking of the newspaper the Latter-day Saints intended to settle. Dealing with early Latter-day Saint history ) The teachings of the early Church saints were the "chosen people of God," whose right it was to inherit such a land, have been recorded as facts by both Mormon and non Mormon historians. The part played b can press in interpreting this concept to the American people, and the repercussions of this interpretation on the Mormon movement have been largely overlooked by historians. The doctrine of the "land of Zion �an inheritance'" was given as direct revelation from God to Joseph Smith, January 2, 1831, at a conference of the Church held in Fayette, New York. It read in part: And I have made the earth rich, and behold it is my footstool, wherefore, again I will stand upon it. And I hold forth and deign to give unto you greater riches, even a land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey, upon which there shall be no curse when the Lord cometh: And I will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance, if you seek it with all your hearts: And this shall be my covenant with you, ye shall have it for the land of your inheritance, and for the inheritance for Page 261 262 your children forever, while the earth shall stand, and ye shall possess it again in eternity, no more to pass away (Doc. And Cov. 38:17-20).; The Prophet Joseph Smith and his family had been "in the news" since 1824, and were well known by 1831. I think it safe to assume that immediately following the giving of this revelation, containing a pronouncement of the destiny of Mormonism, Latter-day Saints began to interpret this concept to their neighbors and friends. Newspaper editors, picking up news of the growing Mormon movement, began their own interpretations of this new doctrine of Zion. Six months after the revelation had been given in New York, the St. Louis Times, St. Louis, Missouri, in its issue of July 9, 1831, carried an article from the Western Courier, Ravenna, Ohio, for May 26, 183:, which said: We understand that a new arrival of Mormonites has taken place�some two hundred men, women and children having lately landed in Geauga county, their holy land, from New York. It is said that they are an active, intelligent and enterprising sect of people. They have commenced a new settlement in the township of Thompson, near the line of Ashtabula county, thus extending their holy land farther east than the limits originally fixed.... The number of believers in the faith, in three or four of the northern townships, is said to exceed one hundred� among whom are many intelligent and respectable individuals, Two months later, on September 17th, the Missouri Intelligencer and Boone's Lick Advertiser, which was published in Columbia, Boone County, Missouri, republished a news item from the Painesville Gazette, Painesville, Ohio, as follows: THE MORMONITES ~� We learn from the Painesville Gazette, that this infatuated people are again in motion. In their own cant phrase, "they are going to inherit the promise of God to Abraham and his seed." Their destination is some indefinite spot on the Missouri River, they say, about 1,500 miles distant. One group of Latter-day Saints did move to their "promised land" in Missouri. With them, at the ex: press wish of the Prophet Joseph Smith, went a printing press and William Wines Phelps, a recent convert to the Church, a printer and publisher of wide experience. There might have been a dual meaning in the publication of the following extract from a history of Connecticut which Mormonism's first editor printed in the first issue of the first periodical�The Evening and Morning Star, published in the new "Zion" at Independence, Missouri:  The following is found in an ancient history of Connecticut. Soon after the settlement of New Haven, several persons went over to what is now the town of Milford, where, finding the soil very good, they were desirous to effect a settlement; but finding the premises were in peaceable possession of the Indians, and some conscientious scruples arose as to the propriety of deposing and expelling them. To test the case a church meeting was called, and the matter determined by the solemn assembly of the sacred body. After several speeches had been made in relation to the subject, they proceeded to pass votes�the first was the following:�Voted, that the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof. This passed in the affirmative; and, Voted, the earth is given to the Saints.�this was also determined like the former�3d. Voted, that we are the Saints, which passed without a dissenting voice, the title was considered indisputable, and the Indians were soon compelled to evacuate the place and relinquish the possession to the rightful owners. this little extract from an old history book, when published in a new Church paper in a new country, into which the Latter-day Saints were just moving, might have been misinterpreted boy the editors, and by readers who were not cognizant of the fact that the saints had received specific instructions to acquire all their land by regular  processes in obedience to the laws of the land. The news of the Mormon "Zion" in Missouri spread rapidly. Three months after the establishment of The Evening and Morning Star, the September 1, 1832 issue of Niles Weekly Register, a paper with nationwide circulation, published at Baltimore, Maryland, carried this news item: MORMONS� Two preachers of this sect have lately visited Boston, and soon made 15 converts to their strange doctrines� some of whom are respectable persons� also joined at Lynn. Certain of these converts have cast  considerable sums of money into the stock, and all were about to depart for the "promised land" in Jackson County, Missouri � the precious spot having been lately discovered. Although it was not the only cause of the failure of the Latter-day Saints to establish a permanent Zion, first in Ohio and then in Missouri, this opposition of the non-Mormon press was perhaps a contributing factor to their failure, because it determined to a large extent the type of co-operation, the saints, as new settlers, received from the older, established settlers. That the blame, if such there be, does not lie wholly at the door of the non-Mormons is implied in a statement written by the Prophet Joseph Smith for another Mormon paper, The Latter-day Saints Messenger and Advocate, September 1835: But to return to my subject . . . and thus the sound of the gathering, and of the doctrine, went abroad into the world; and many, we have reason to fear, having zeal not according to knowledge, not understanding the pure principles of the doctrine of the church, have no doubt, in the heat of enthusiasm, taught and said many things which are derogatory to the genuine character and principles of the church, and for these things we are heartily sorry, and would apologize if an apology would do any good. If it can be said that the saints failed to establish their Zion in Ohio and Missouri, their failure seemingly did not dim their spirit. One might, with justification, apply to them the earlier words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, spoken of himself: For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation ( Joseph Smith 2:25). They believed in the reality of the 'land of Zion," and they were not to be daunted by their own weaknesses and failures in Ohio and Missouri, nor by outside opposition and persecution. They built their own city in Illinois, and at Nauvoo, they were virtually autonomous. In this city of Zion, they took great pride, so it is understandable how, at the opening of the Prophet Joseph Smith's Nauvoo House, they felt impressed to pass a series of resolutions extolling the greatness of their leader and of their city of Zion. But these resolutions, published in the Times and Seasons, were 264 picked up by the nation's press as a further indication of What they felt was Mormon arrogance and a "chosen people" complex. The news of the Prophet's death, in 1844, was widely publicized, as outlined in the second installment of this series. The first opinion of the press, generally, was that with the Prophet's death, Mormonism and the attempts to establish Zion Were at an end. The Alton Telegraph, Alton, Illinois, said in October, 1844: DISSOLUTION OF THE MORMON CHURCH - - � The elements of The elements of discord and disunion are successfully at work in the community at Nauvoo, and no doubt rests upon our mind, but that the total dissolution of the Church will be the inevitable result .... With the fall of the "prophet," fell also the throne of despotism he had erected in this Republic, and the charm that enabled him to delude the populace has with his death, departed, we trust, forever. Mormonism departed from Illinois, but not from existence, as the editors had hoped it would. With the decision of the Latter-day Saints to remove West, came a revival of the Zionist fear so far as the press of the United States was concerned. This renewed interest on the part of the press may have been stimulated, in part, by an article which John Taylor published in the Times and Seasons, November 15, 1845. An imperial edict has been  issued in China, giving Christian missionaries liberty to preach, and the Chinese freedom to embrace Christianity ....This will open the door for the Elders of the Latter-day Saints and as our future location will embrace California, Oregon, or Vancouver's Island, we may bring the Chinese with their wealth, directly into the Kingdom of God, to "build up the waste places of Zion," without molestation. The Lord is certainly preparing the way for all nations to go up to his holy mountain, and worship Him in the beauty of holiness. Mormonism is here a little and there a little, until the whole lump be leavened. Some of the saints did go to California with the Mormon Battalion, and with Samuel Brannan. This revived the Zionist concept in the press once more and the Galena Gazette, Galena, Illinois, published a letter dated October 1, 1847, from a correspondent in California, in which fear was once more expressed that the Mormons were attempting to "take over" the country. The country is flooded with Mormons. Their regiment under Col. Cook, has been disbanded . . . besides this, Mormon emigrants are arriving daily, by sea and land, from Europe and America � all bringing arms and ammunition to fight, as they say, �the battles of the Lord,� and relieved their afflicted brethren from the persecutions and bondage of the Moabite, and to build up an inheritance to the Lord in the wilderness. These articles are only a selected few out of thousands which I have copied from newspapers covering the entire nation. I have sought to make the selection representative. In them there is evidence of the persistent efforts of the saints to carry out the will of the Lord and establish Zion. There is also evidence that the press of the nation seemed to be convinced that the "Mormon Zionist" movement promised no good for the residents of those areas in which the Latter-day Saints wished to settle. This attitude of the press undoubtedly increased the difficulties of Mormon settlement. MORMONISM IN THE EYES OF THE PRESS The important point to remember in any evaluation of Mormon history is that these accounts were published as the views, or intentions, of the Mormons. After careful study, I have no reason to doubt that the average citizen of New York, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri or California believed that 265 these newspaper accounts expressed the teachings of the Church leaders; the intentions of the Mormons to "take over' America and establish Zion; and to use force, if necessary, to accomplish their goal. The task of our pioneer forefathers was undoubtedly rendered more difficult by the opposition thus engendered.
