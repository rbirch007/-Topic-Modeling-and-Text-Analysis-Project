The Greatest Miracle Elder Spencer W. Kimbal] Member of the Quorum of the Twelve 66  "CHRIST Is Risen!" called a friend to his neighbor, and his friend, likewise a faithful Christian, responded: "He is risen indeed!" Thus, with this assurance, salutation and a kiss, the brethren long ago greeted each other on Easter morning.
Again we approach the Eastertime in commemoration of the resurrection of the Lord, and though many professed Christians leaders and laity would trim from the wondrous story its divinity and supernatural aspects, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints affirms and bears testimony to a doubting world that Jesus Christ, born in Bethlehem, was the Son of God�the Only Begotten of the Father, and having fully met and conquered all enemies, including death, he was the "firstfruits of them that slept," and opened the door to redemption to all the mortal beings on earth existence. And because he was divine as well as mortal, and because he overcame all things and became perfected, he had the power to come forth from the grave; and the long-awaited resurrection became a reality.
Many are the modern doubters. They would say with doubting Thomas, "Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe" (John 20:25). And to them the Lord says: "Be not faithless, but believing" (John 21:27). And to those many who, full of faith,
accept the miraculous happening, he says: ". . . . Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed" (John 21:29).
And the message of Easter comes ringing year after year, a sweet refrain: "Believe�Believe."
This greatest miracle of all time we celebrate each Eastertime. It is the miracle of the victory over the grave, the nullification of the sting of death, the triumph over the last enemy�death.
A miracle is an event which we do not understand or explain. Since the beginning of the race, all men had died through disease, accident, or senility, and no escape from this dread finality had ever been found, though intellectuals had studied, physicians had experimented, and all known cures had been attempted. It is true that death had been postponed by skilled technicians and, in the case of the widow's son, Elijah actually overcame death temporarily. But for a time only, for this person, restored for a time to his sorrowing mother, must yet pass through the dissolution process of mortal death. In the case of Lazarus the Savior also delayed the death of dissolution; by calling this friend from the tomb. But, here again, Lazarus was not changed to immortality, but remained still a mortal, subject to disease and accident, and must, in days to come, pass through the dreaded change again.
And so it remained for Jesus of Nazareth to have and use the power

220 to overcome death in oneself. And through him now comes power to al] who have lived forth in immortality. "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall al] be made alive" (I Cor. 1 5:22), The mystery Was so little comprehended, small wonder that the disciples of Jesus - yet they be. -... Though he many miracles before them..., (John 12:37). How could they understand when, in their experience, nothing like this of which Jesus spoke had ever happened >? Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest .." (John 14:5). And, speaking wonderingly among themselves, they frequently said". - We cannot tell what he saith" (John 16:18), They even Supposed that he talked of buildings made by hands when he said: ++� Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Jesus frequently spoke to them of his death and of h And the old scriptures which they If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will | wait, till my change come (Job. 14:14). And though, after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall | see God... (Job 19:26), And the psalmist declared: For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption (Psalms 16:10), I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness (Psalms 17:1 5). Isaiah promised: He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces (Isaiah 2 5:8). Yet still his followers were confused and understood not, ONLY a God could bring about this miracle of resurrection. As a teacher of righteousness, Jesus could inspire souls to goodness; as a Prophet, he could foreshadow the future; as an intelligent leader of men, he could organize a Church: and as a possessor and magnifier of the Priesthood, he could heal the sick, give sight to the blind, and even raise other dead; but only as a God could he rise himself from the tomb, overcome death permanently, and bring incorruption in Place of corruption, and replace mortality with immortality, Very early in his mortal life, Jesus seemed to realize that he was of divine Parentage, and that in him lay the power to effect the miracle Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them (Luke 2:49-50). Later, he spoke of his death and of this new power which he possessed: THE GREATEST MIRACLE I am the good shepherd, the good Shepherd giveth his life for the sheep... And I lay down My life for the Sheep.  No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down Of myself, I have Power to lay it down, and I have Power to take It again This commandment have I received of my Father. (John 10:11, 15, 18). All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth (Matt. 28:18). And when impetuous Peter raised his sword and inflicted damage to the mobster in Gethsemane, the calm Lord said: Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled? (Matt. 26:53-54). And we know that he was omnipotent, for he is God. In the writings of Moses the Lord spoke, saying: I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by mine Only Begotten I created these things . . . (Moses 2:1). And in the Book of Abraham that great prophet tells us that, associated with the Father, was the one 'like unto the Son of Man" (Abraham 3:27), who was to become Jesus of Nazareth in the flesh: And they went down at the beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth (Abra-ham 4:1). Again the Savior identified him-self before his mortal birth, saying to the Jaredites: Behold I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ (Ether 3:14). And to the Nephites he said: Behold I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning . . . ( 3 Ne-phi 9:15). Having created the earth and planned its program, he understood the processes of life and death and the resurrection, and had power to deal with them. He knew the end from the beginning, for he told the Nephites in America, on the night that Joseph and Mary were in the stable in Bethlehem anticipating his coming :.... on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfill all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets( 3 N ephi 1:13). Being mortal and divine, and having suffered all things, he now be-came perfect. He had overcome temptations, he had restored the gospel, established his Church, and now suffered death to come upon him, " .... to fulfill all righteousness" (Matthew 3:15)7 that he might in-augurate the w holly new program of the resurrection, so mysterious and unexplainable to the people. The resurrection is literal. In accordance with the predictions made by his prophets before him and by Jesus Christ himself, he came forth from the grave and the greatest mir-acle of all time was a reality. He had gone below all things that he might rise above all things. He had suffered a humiliating, ignoble death by crucifixion; a death so intolerable and cruel. Extremely horrible as was his death, in contrast was his resurrection glorious. For indeed, a death by crucifixion seems to include all that pain and death can have of horrible and ghastly dizziness, cramp, thirst, starvation, sleeplessness, traumatic fever, tetanus, publicity of shame, long continuance of torment, horror of anticipation, mortification of untended wounds � all intensified just u p to the point at which the\- can be endured at all, but all stop-ping just short of the point which would give the sufferer the relief of unconscious-ness. The unnatural position made every movement painful; the lacerated veins and crushed tendons throbbed with incessant anguish; the wounds, inflamed by exposure, gradually gangrened; the arteries � especially of the head and stomach � be-came swollen and oppressed with sur-charged blood; and while each variety of misery went on gradually increasing, there was added to them the intolerable pang of burning and raging thirst; and all these physical complications caused an internal excitement and anxiety, which made the prospect of death itself � of death, the awful unknown enemy, at whose approach man usually shudders most � bear the aspect of a delicious and exquisite release. (Cannon Farrar, Life oi Christ, p. 499). THIS death was ignominious, terrible, awful, but in striking contrast was the tranquility, beauty, and glory of his resurrection. Ever since mortality came upon Adam, men had feared death, the one enemy which could never be conquered. Herbs and medicines, prayers and surgery, medicine-men and priests, sorcery and magic, all had been used for milleniums in an attempt to overcome, or at least to postpone death but, in spite of all the machi-nations and efforts of men in all the earth, up to this time they had failed; and the rich and poor, ignorant and educated, black, brown, red, or white, priest and people, all had gone clown in death and gone back to mother earth. Hut now came the miracle� the revolution, the unbelievable marvel which none could explain and which none could deny. For the body which these hosts had seen persecuted, tortured, and drained of its life's blood, and left dead upon the cross; the body from which all life had ebbed; the body which lay entombed those long hours in a small, closed and sealed, oxygenless room into the third day; the person who had suffered the fate of death like hundreds of millions before him was calmly walking in the garden, animated, fresh, alive! No human hands had been at work to remove the sealed door nor to resuscitate nor restore. No magician nor sorcerer had invaded the precincts to work his cures; not even the Priesthood, exercised by another, had been brought in use to heal, but the God who had purposefully and intentionally laid down his life had, by the power of his godhead, taken up his life again. The change had been wrought in the little sealed room without help or knowledge of the sorrowing individuals who would gladly have done anything to assist. Alone, by the power he possessed within himself, came the greatest miracle. The spirit which had been by him commended to his Father in Heaven from the cross, and which, according to his later reports, had been to the spirit world, had re-turned and, ignoring the impenetrable walls of the sepulcher, had entered the place, re-entered the body, had caused the stone door to be rolled away, and walked in life again, with his body changed to im-mortality, incorruptible� his even faculty keen and alert. Unexplainable? Yes! And not understandable � but incontestable. More than 500 unimpeachable witnesses had contact with him. They walked with him, talked with him, ate with him, felt the flesh of his body and saw the wounds in his side and feet and hands; discussed with him the program which had been common to them, and him; and, by many infallible proofs knew and testified that he was risen, and that that last and most dreaded enemy, death, had been overcome. THE GREATEST MIRACLE And they testified, also, that since he had opened the grave, many others had been likewise raised into immortality through the same program, and had likewise been identified and accepted in Jerusalem. And so, for forty days, the earth he had created was sanctified by his presence; his Church was perfected; his people were inspired with a fire that would never be extinguished; and then he ascended to his Father in Heaven. Our abhorrence at his torture and our sorrow at his ignoble death are turned to joy and gratitude as we realize in the miracle of the resurrection the mastery over death. The Master himself predicted our deep emotions: Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you (John 16:20-22). To the Latter-day Saints the resurrection is indeed a reality, for resurrected beings have appeared in this dispensation. John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Savior, beheaded by Herod, came to restore the Aaronic Priesthood and, embodied with a 223 tabernacle of flesh and bones, he laid his hands upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, conferring upon them the Priesthood. Peter, James, and John, the apostles, in resurrected bodies, came to restore to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, the Melchizedek Priesthood. Moroni, last heard of in the vicinity of Hill Cumorah about fourteen centuries earlier, came again in the nineteenth century to bring the Book of Mormon plates, and to teach the gospel to the boy Prophet; and God the Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared in the grove to the young Prophet. And so we bear testimony that the being who created the earth and its contents, who made numerous appearances upon the earth prior to his birth in Bethlehem, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is resurrected and immortal, and that this great boon of resurrection and immortality becomes now, through our Redeemer, the heritage of mankind, and we cry to all the inhabitants of the earth� in the words of Mary Connelly Kimball: Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead. Awake to an appreciation of all that is highest and best. Live not the narrow sordid life, but the big life of helpfulness. Cast away the cloak of selfishness, put on the mantle of love. Awake! Arise! Go forth with a light step, a glad heart, a happy smile, for Christ is risen! He has conquered death, hell, and the grave! Honor and praise him for, through his atoning sacrifice, the grave has lost its victory, death its sting, and all shall come forth from the tomb to the judgment. Burst forth into singing, you ransomed ones. Praise him who-has ascended on High. Note: Mary Connelly Kimball will be remembered as the gracious and gifted editor of The-37. Photograph by Wilford C.
