Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, April 1, and April 15, 1887 "For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women of ALL Nations" FROM SMITHFIELD, CACHE COUNTY: Our beloved president of the Relief Society, Mrs. Moorhead, is always on the watch tower, ready to help the poor and needy, to comfort the sick and strengthen the weak, and render assistance wherever it is needed.... Truly this is a day of rejoicing�a temple is built to the Most High�an ensign to the people.... May the blessings of the Lord attend all our efforts to do good. �Martha M. Williams BE A TRUE WOMAN Be a woman! On to duty! Raise the world from all that's low, Place high in the social heaven Virtue's fair and radiant bow. HOME AFFAIRS: We return thanks for the "Utah Musical Bouquet," edited by Daynes and Son. We watch with pleasurable interest all the improvements which tend to develop talent among the people. We are gratified to see so many home productions in songs and music.�Editorial HINTS TO WRITERS AND SPEAKERS: Be simple, unaffected; be honest in your speaking and writing. Never use a long word when a short one will do.... The only way to shine even in this false world is to be modest and unassuming.... Elegance of language may not be in the power of all of us, but simplicity and straightforwardness are. Write much as you would speak; speak as you think �William Cullen Bryant WELCOME TO SPRING O beauteous spring! Fragrant of leaf and bloom; Nature, with myriad welcomes, hails thy birth; Thou breathest, and lo! A rich and sweet perfume Rises like incense from the gladdened earth. �Emile FROM FAYETTE, SANPETE COUNTY: We feel that the storing up of grain is of the Lord, and we have on hand quite a quantity and will add to it as fast as we can. By courtesy of our President, John Bartholomew, our wheat is stored in his granary till we can get one built for our own use. There is a good rock meeting house in this place for which the Relief Society has made mats and carpets. We also purchased a stove and the window furniture, so you see, beloved sisters, that we can always find something to do. I contemplate introducing the silk culture. Jane A. Brown, Pres't. PREJUDICE: There is every day ample opportunity to observe the manifold evils arising from prejudice. How often do some of us allow ourselves to speak evil or slanderous things of those who have proved themselves friends in the truest sense. We are too willing to believe evil of our fellow beings.... How very careful we should be never to say a word to injure the character of any person.... Let us guard our own tongues, discipline our own thoughts, see that our hearts are free from impurity, and we will have no time to encourage evil�Mary Stuart Page 248 Woman�s Sphere Ramona W.

EDITORIAL ��2 APRIL 1947 VOL. 34 "All These Shings Shall Be Held In Remembrance" WE know what children do and say, but where shall we find and recall our own childhood. If we carefully reconstruct this most pliable period of life, its joys, and its they ate, for we shall see ourselves as we were. Early impressions are so deep and lasting that they stay with us forever. And beyond our visible recalling there is a background of attitudes and a web of habits which affect us vitally, but which we cannot trace. The various facets of disposition and personality are first woven on the loom of childhood. These lasting impressions are pure emotion, unmarked, at first, by logic or morality. There is but a small background of experience for their interpretation. We may lose some of the wonder and the glory, the color and the sound of childhood, but out of the tapestry of days there are treasures that remain bright as jewels, and every time the beauty-seeking mind goes back to them, their lasting luster reflects a new radiance. Go into the treasury of your own house of memories and see what you find. How did the events which Page 250 you recall happen, and what is their significance? Think quietly of this, and let your childhood come back that you may see again the measure of life and look upon your own an other children with a new understanding. The Bible tells us that Zacharias, rejoicing in the birth of his son, asked for a writing table and wrote, saying: _.. His name is John..-- and all these heard them laid t saying, What manner of child will this be? What manner of child will this be? He will grow as you direct him, with his roots in his ancestry, and he will be swayed by his environment. His experiences will become memories, and they will affect his life when he is a man. To a large extent these memories will determine the course of his life. The essence of childhood should be love and security. Years are the Eden of life. Let childhood have its day. Let each little one remember his mother's face, his father's voice. Let him remember good music, beautiful pictures, quietness, kind words, and laughter. V. P. C.
