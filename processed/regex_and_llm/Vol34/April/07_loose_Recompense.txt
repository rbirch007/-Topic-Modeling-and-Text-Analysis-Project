recompensed lavishly in the immortal coin of love and trust. "Aunt" or "Grandma" to all who knew her, she went like a ministering angel, and was welcomed as such in every home. Hearts, as well as bodies, were made whole again by her gentle ministrations. First secretary-treasurer of the Kirtland Relief Society was Betsy Burnham, wife of George Burnham. Sister Burnham filled this position with dignity, although her duties were far from onerous. At that time the "treasury" consisted of a few carpet rags, several spools of thread (very precious), and some bars of homemade soap. Meetings, after the organization on July 12, 1883, at first were held once a month. The treasurer's daughter, Sister Sadie Dustin, remembers helping to collect the "Sunday eggs" from the members, the only source of revenue the organization had at that time. Sisters Lucretia Black and Gerda Hendrickson were second and third presidents of the fast growing Society. There were many other early and important settlers, some of whose descendants today are influential citizens in the communities along the San Juan River. Among these early settlers were Francis Hammond, the first stake president, and Mary his wife, the first Relief Society stake president. They and a host of other faithful and courageous saints possessed the vision and faith which were common characteristics of all Latter-day Saint pioneers who traveled into unknown regions at the request of the Church leaders that Zion might enlarge her stakes.
