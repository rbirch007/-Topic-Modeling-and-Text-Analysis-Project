A Reward for Cheerful Service A True Incident Lucinda M. Chidester Harrington It was a cold, bleak morning. Two Relief Society visiting teachers were driving along in an old, one-horse rig. The loose tires rattled as they bounced over the rough highway, throwing dirt and clods into the laps of the sisters. The decrepit, straw-fed horse needed constant urging to keep him moving. As the sisters shivered with cold, one asked, "I wonder if we do enough good to pay for all the freezing and thawing we go through, traveling fourteen miles to go around our district?" "Well, Sister Marble," the other teacher replied, "we are doing our duty, and I am always reminded of a memory gem given by one of the sisters, �Do your duty, that is best, leave unto your God the rest.� Just then the rig rounded a hill and the women saw a spiral of smoke rising from the chimney of a log cabin. "Well, it looks like Sister Nettie must still be in the valley; we must stop and see," exclaimed Sister Chidester. The cabin looked gloomy and dark, with a piece of canvas serving as the only door. On hearing the rig, a pale-faced woman came out to meet them, and burst into tears. As she talked between sobs, the sisters learned that her husband had left a while ago to find work in town, promising to return later for his family.

The mother said that for days they had had nothing to eat but some rice. The visiting teachers at once drove home as fast as they could, but soon came pack through the bitter cold in a whitetop, bringing flour, butter, and eggs from No Santa Claus was ever welcomed more joyfully than 'were those two humble Relief Society teachers that cold winter day, and no hearts were ever happier for having performed a simple duty in God's service.
