Young Samantha Christie Lund Coles THERE was singing and laughter about the Campfire, and 800d-fellowship, well what dangers the night might hold... H soft-footed prowl, and other dangers not to be put in words, illness, death, the ter. Tors that darkness too often carried in its silken folds. Before these, they were silent now. Samantha knew what was to come, and she automatically bowed her head, as did the Others. Then, Over the peaceful stillness, their leader's Player was clear and distinct, sincere and meaningful: "Lord, protect us through this night that all will be well with us and ours. Give us strength and courage for morrow afraid. Let nothing stay us from Teaching our destination. In the name of him who loved us more than life. Amen." As he finished, Samantha slipped of her husband, felt his fingers close them, urging them on. Most of the men pushed handcarts, most of the women walked as much as Possible. The wagons, taking care of the young riding over the rough, unbroken trails would have been tiresome had it not been such a heavenly relief just to sit down, to rest the feet and the aching back, "Wish we could stay over another day here. It's been nice for the children to run and Play." She started to rise as she spoke. Still holding her hand, he answered, "Yes. But it is not safe to waste even one day. The clouds are gathering. If we get in a bad storm? - well..." He paused, but she As they were starting toward their wagon, someone in the crowd called, "Let's have one more round of singing 'Come, Come Ye Saints' to put us in fettle for tomorrow." There were shouts of agreement, and the company, Standing, their heads uplifted now, sang with sincerity and fervor the words, "Why should we mourn or think our lot hard, 'tis not SO, all is well..." Samantha, as always when she back straighten and her eyes film with tears. She felt honored and proud to be among the select company of those who dared leave all things for the right to worship as they believed.
Yet, she knew, too, that for her it had been easy. She had Tim, who was handsome and good, and whose love made any experience an adventure. She had her lovely child, asleep now beneath the soft and beautiful down quilt which had been one of the few really nice things she had been able to bring with her.
It was not so easy for the old, for the sick, for those who had left their loved ones. Each night she said a special little prayer for these: Sister Wilkins, whose back was lame; brother Brandt, who was so old, yet was determined to live to see his dream and his faith vindicated; and others. She had come to love them all, to feel a real kinship with them and their lives.
"What a night," Tim said, as he and his wife started again to their wagon, hand in hand. "What marvelous testimonies were borne. We're lucky, Marutha. The Lord has been good to us!"
"Oh, yes. Yes, he has," she agreed, feeling the words with her entire being. "And now for a good night's sleep so we can get an early start."
Tim went to see about the oxen and their horse while Samantha climbed into the wagon box. The moon was shining in, and she could see that the bedclothes on her child's bed were ruffled.
"You rascal," she whispered, more to herself than to the three-year-old child she pretended to be addressing, "always kicking off the covers."
She picked up the light-as-air down quilt and went to put it over her child, to tuck it about her soft, smooth little shoulders . . . but there were no shoulders there, no tousled, small head. She reached farther down into the bed. She looked on the floor, into her own bed, a foot or two away.
She couldn't scream. She couldn't make a sound. She couldn't even move. She was a dark shaft of sudden, petrified terror until she saw Tim's figure in the entrance. Then she ran to him with a cry that seemed not to come from herself, but from something wild, caught, and dying.
THE light of day was breaking in the thin, pale ribbons across the little valley, the hills, and the mountains surrounding it. The animals were stomping and neighing restlessly. Some of them had awakened in the night, as though aware of the commotion going on, the flaring torches, the calling, the hurried movement of anxious feet.
Marutha sat slumped beside a wagon wheel, a quilt thrown about her shoulders, her eyes circled darkly, her face streaked with dirt and tears. But now, there were no more tears, only a vacuous staring into space. The men, who had rested toward morning, were starting their search again . . . over hills, under shrubbery and trees.
The sun was high in the sky. The kindly women had tried to urge Samantha to eat some breakfast, and, out of pity for their anxious, sorrowing faces, she tried to take a little of the food they gave her. But she couldn't swallow it. She could only close her eyes, try to shut out thought and remembrance. 234 Some where back in her mind the words they had sung about the campfire sang themselves over and over... "And if we die before our journey's through, happy day, all is well." But oh, Father in Heaven! To die oneself was one thing. To lose that which was more than life, that which was so small, so very dear, was another! And not to know... Alive... Or dead... Harmed or safe... Where... Tim came to her, his clothes covered with dust, weeds caught in his boots, his hands scratched and red. His arms went about her and he whispered, "My dearest girl, we'll search all day, all week, until we find her. And we will find her." Then his voice breaking, "Dear God, we must?' Samantha raised heavy eyes to the sky, where clouds were gathering more quickly than before. There was a coolness in the air which was more than the ice that enveloped her. Suddenly, she threw the blanket from about her shoulders and stood up. Her voice was calm, as she told her husband, "Tell them not to search any more." "But they have started again." "Tell them to stop the search. There are a hundred and more whose lives are in danger if we stay. We can't ask them to take that Tighe' Tim, and those who were near, looked at her incredulously. 'after awhile Tim said. "You mean," one woman asked, "that you would let her perish?" "That's better than that we all perish," said another. "You are a brave woman." Her husband merely looked at her, tears streaming down his face. As one sleepwalking, she reached out to touch his cheek, and asked, "Where is our faith if it isn't for this, too?" She turned resolutely toward the wagon and the impatient oxen. She was ready to step onto the tongue when she heard a shout, first of one voice and then of many, coming nearer and nearer. She looked toward the hillside and saw some of the men running. As they drew nearer, she saw that one of them carried something on his shoulder, something... Alive... Calling, "Mummie, Mummie." Samantha started to move, to run forward. Then everything began spinning about her. She sank into a deep, velvet darkness. When she came to, she was lying in her bed, the soft down quilt over her, and her beautiful darling, her beloved baby, beside her. She wept then, wildly, sobbingly, wept until "Samantha, you musn't. You musn't. I've never seen anybody weep like that before. You must stop or you'll be sick. Oh, Manthy, Manthy, my dear. And to think you were ready to leave Her..."
