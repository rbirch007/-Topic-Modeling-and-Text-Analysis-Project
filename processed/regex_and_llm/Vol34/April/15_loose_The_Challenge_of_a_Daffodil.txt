THE CHALLENGE OF A DAFFODIL Wanda W. Lund The icy, sleet-filled winds of March That drove the snow with shuddering blast Are quieted now. White mounds piled high, Like templed spires against the sky, Melt silently, and spring has come at last. Consider death�is it the end? Its icy hand will touch all men; And when our time on earth is through, Are we destined to live again? As surely as the springtime comes, And balmy days replace the chill, The spirit's triumph over death Exemplifies, through love and faith, The constant challenge of a daffodil.
