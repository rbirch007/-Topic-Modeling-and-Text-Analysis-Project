Select Safe Clothes C. Aileen Ericksen Director of Home Economics Education, Utah State Department of Public Instruction address may contribute to her bodily comfort, facilitating the activities of work and play. Throughout history, so strong has been the urge "to do as others do" - that women have accepted customs and styles of dress which were uncomfortable, which presented health and safety hazards, which limited activity, and which often were really ugly. Environment and activities direct one's choice of clothing. Most of us have had the experience of owning garments unsuited for our activities and environment. Velvet lounging pajamas owned by a girl who must help with the work of her home and has neither time for lounging nor a setting suitable for luxurious fabrics; swimming suits owned by the person who never swims; and riding jodhpurs prized by the girl who neither rides nor hikes�all are examples of purchases of garments that violate a rule of fitness. Aside from influencing the choice of article, the environment and activities also affect the colors, the fabrics, and the design deemed suitable. Perhaps the relation of environment and activity to clothing needs can be most wisely determined if the following steps are taken: 1. List all the activities in which you engage, making marks to designate relative frequency of each. 2. List the garments you will need to be properly dressed for these occasions. Page 266 3. On this factual basis, decide what influence each of the separate activities in which you engage should exert on your total clothing choices. 4. Plan so that the selection of clothing may also be influenced by safety features. The kind of clothing a woman wears, the way she keeps it in repair, and the style in which she wears her hair can affect her living to the extent that an accident may mean permanent injury or disfigurement. The style, fit, and material are important for safety. Let us consider several important items in this connection. 1. Projecting or flowing sleeves are not suitable for kitchen wear. They catch on chairs and door knobs, and also interfere in eating. They are especially dangerous when near a fire or when worn during the laundrying procedure. Short fitted sleeves are safe for household work. Those that are above the elbow are safest. 2. Large pockets, sashes, and bows, are especially bad when worn near cupboards and around stoves, for they catch on projecting objects and tend to tangle in flames. Pockets should be flat and should not extend away from the garment. Set in belts are safe because they are absolutely flat. Narrow flat bows are best; wide fluffy ones may catch on objects. 3. Long, large, and loose garments are tripping hazards. They are especially dangerous when the wearer is climbing or descending stairways. 4. Tight garments restrict movement. If clothes are tight they have a tendency to twist and get in the way when one stoops or climbs, and thus they contribute to fatigue.. SELECT SAFE CLOTHEs 267 Action-back blouses, or blouses with fullness, permit freer shoulder movements. Skirts should be moderately wide to allow free movement. 5. Wedgies, bedroom slippers, and dress shoes with high heels increase the danger of tripping. Poorly fitted shoes do not give proper support and often cause fatigue. Broken shoe laces may cause tripping. Shoe heels and soles should be kept in good repair. 6. Rayon and cotton napped fabrics that have not been given flame resistant treatment catch fire easily and burn rapidly. Extensive experiments have been conducted in making materials flame resistant, and when these are available on the market, another step will have been taken toward safety. Plan your spending to include all your wants� and to get what you want most for your money. Consider the type of clothes which you need, and consider the design with regard to the service which you expect. Consider the whole wardrobe and make the new purchases relate to it in safety, color, and becomingness� and, above all, let us follow the old rhyme when selecting clothes so that we may improve our techniques to gain the ultimate in quality when making our selections: Good, better, best Never let them rest Till your good is better And your better, best!
