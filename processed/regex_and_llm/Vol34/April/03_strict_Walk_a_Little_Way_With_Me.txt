WALK A LITTLE WAY WITH ME
Leona Bammies Gardner
Come, Friend, and walk a little way with me, For well I know the heavy load you bear; Here, take my willing hand. Talk if you wish� Let me a little of your burden share.
Come, Friend, and walk a little way with me; The birds still sing; God hears and answers prayer. Come, let the healing sunshine fill your soul And wipe away your sorrow and despair.
Tomorrow, I must lift my load again And face the day with fortitude and grace. Today, I laid my own small griefs aside To bask with you of peace and a smiling face. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, April 1, and April 15, 1887 "For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women of ALL Nations" FROM SMITHFIELD, CACHE COUNTY: Our beloved president of the Relief Society, Mrs. Moorhead, is always on the watch tower, ready to help the poor and needy, to comfort the sick and strengthen the weak, and render assistance wherever it is needed.... Truly this is a day of rejoicing�a temple is built to the Most High�an ensign to the people.... May the blessings of the Lord attend all our efforts to do good. �Martha M.

Never use a long word when a short one will do.... The only way to shine even in this false world is to be modest and unassuming.... Elegance of language may not be in the power of all of us, but simplicity and straightforwardness are.

By courtesy of our President, John Bartholomew, our wheat is stored in his granary till we can get one built for our own use. There is a good rock meeting house in this place for which the Relief Society has made mats and carpets. We also purchased a stove and the window furniture, so you see, beloved sisters, that we can always find something to do. I contemplate introducing the silk culture. Jane A. Brown, Pres't. PREJUDICE: There is every day ample opportunity to observe the manifold evils arising from prejudice. How often do some of us allow ourselves to speak evil or slanderous things of those who have proved themselves friends in the truest sense. We are too willing to believe evil of our fellow beings.... How very careful we should be never to say a word to injure the character of any person.... Let us guard our own tongues, discipline our own thoughts, see that our hearts are free from impurity, and we will have no time to encourage evil�Mary Stuart Page 248 Woman�s Sphere Ramona W.

EDITORIAL ��2 APRIL 1947 VOL. 34 "All These Shings Shall Be Held In Remembrance" WE know what children do and say, but where shall we find and recall our own childhood. If we carefully reconstruct this most pliable period of life, its joys, and its they ate, for we shall see ourselves as we were. Early impressions are so deep and lasting that they stay with us forever. And beyond our visible recalling there is a background of attitudes and a web of habits which affect us vitally, but which we cannot trace. The various facets of disposition and personality are first woven on the loom of childhood. These lasting impressions are pure emotion, unmarked, at first, by logic or morality. There is but a small background of experience for their interpretation. We may lose some of the wonder and the glory, the color and the sound of childhood, but out of the tapestry of days there are treasures that remain bright as jewels, and every time the beauty-seeking mind goes back to them, their lasting luster reflects a new radiance. Go into the treasury of your own house of memories and see what you find. How did the events which Page 250 you recall happen, and what is their significance? Think quietly of this, and let your childhood come back that you may see again the measure of life and look upon your own an other children with a new understanding. The Bible tells us that Zacharias, rejoicing in the birth of his son, asked for a writing table and wrote, saying: _.. His name is John..-- and all these heard them laid t saying, What manner of child will this be? What manner of child will this be? He will grow as you direct him, with his roots in his ancestry, and he will be swayed by his environment. His experiences will become memories, and they will affect his life when he is a man. To a large extent these memories will determine the course of his life. The essence of childhood should be love and security. Years are the Eden of life. Let childhood have its day. Let each little one remember his mother's face, his father's voice. Let him remember good music, beautiful pictures, quietness, kind words, and laughter. V. P. C. Breakfast Is an Important Meal Hazel Stevens Nutrition Consultant, Utah State Department of Health HE food one eats over a period of time nourishes the body and supplies nutrients for growth, repair, and maintenance. Breakfast is an important meal because the body has been without food for ten to fourteen hours. Food of the right kind is needed for the morning's activities. The following observations have shown the need for a better breakfast campaign: 1. Many working girls and housewives become tired, restless, hungry, and crave snacks during the midmorning hours when they skip breakfast. These snacks include candy, "pops," and pastries, rather than essential foods. These women fail to realize how breakfast may contribute towards efficiency and enjoyment of the day's activities. 2. Too many individuals take a mere glass of fruit juice or milk, and sometimes a roll or doughnut, and consider this a good breakfast. 3. Many teachers have reported that some children come to school without breakfast. These children tend to become tired, restless, and inattentive before lunch time. If you or any of your family members are "breakfast skippers," ask yourselves why? Then proceed to rectify this mistake. These may be among the reasons: 1. In a hurry? Not enough time? Most people would have time to prepare and eat breakfast if they would get up a little earlier. For children, it may mean retiring a little earlier at night. Breakfast requires such a little time to prepare. Sometimes it can be prepared the night before. Ten to twenty minutes should be allowed for breakfast. 2. Not hungry? This may be because the individual has improper food, fails to get exercise, or has too little activity. It may also be a habit. If the non-hungry feeling persists, the individual should have a complete examination by his physician and follow his suggestions. In some Cases, poor appetite exists because the physical condition of the individual may be below par. If one is in good physical condition, the right kind of food, properly prepared, will cause normal hunger. The nonhungry feeling may sometimes be caused by emotional upsets. Sufficient time, a happy mood, attractive and tasty dishes will help the appetite. 3. Afraid of getting fat? A good breakfast has fewer calories than candy, soda pop, and pastries. 4. Dislike of breakfast foods? This may be due to a lack of variety in foods and too little variation in preparation. For example, one can grow to dislike eggs if he is served a fried egg every morning. Eggs may be prepared in many different ways to appease the eye and the appetite. Cereals may be cooked in milk, fruit Page 251 252 added, served hot or chilled, or sliced and fried as scrapple. Milk can be put into many breakfast dishes so that one does not always need to use it as a drink, 5. Think breakfast is not as important as other meals? Authorities in the field of nutrition say the wellbeing of individuals can be harmed by skipping breakfast, which is the most neglected meal. From many standpoints breakfast is the most important meal. Failure to get sufficient amounts of the right kind of food may result in fatigue, irritability, and lessened efficiency. There is no arbitrary list of foods which must be breakfast foods. One can select from the day's needs, considering the two other meals. Eggs, milk, cereal, and fruit are good choices. The amount or size of breakfast for each individual will vary with age, activity, and condition of the individual, but the kind of food and method of preparation need not be changed for every member of the family. Select your breakfast from these daily food needs: MILK: 1 pint for adults, 3/4 quart for children, and 1 quart for pregnant and nursing mothers. EGGS: One. MEAT, FISH, OR POULTRY: One serving. Occasionally, cheese or dried peas or beans may be substituted. 

VEGETABLES: Three or more servings FRUITS: Two or more servings (one should be rich in vitamin C, for example, citrus fruits or tomatoes). CEREAL AND BREAD: Cereal two to five times weekly, some bread at each meal. FAT AND SUGAR: Approximately 1/2 pound of each per person per week.

The information has been carefully gleaned from diaries, journals, and personal interviews. Ed.] Synopsis: A company of twenty-four young men and two families � James L. Davis, his wife Mary, and their four children; Henry H. Harriman, his wife Elizabeth, and their five children � are called to explore a route from Cedar City, in Southern Utah, to San Juan County, Utah. The two families are to remain in San Juan and, at a point where the Montezuma Creek comes into the San Juan River, are to establish an outpost and prepare for the coming of the main company of settlers, members of the San Juan Mission. The twenty-four scouts are to re-turn to their homes and report their findings. The purpose of the mission is to cultivate and maintain peaceful and friendly relations with the Indians, who are almost the sole occupants of the large isolated country. While driving her team at night, across a sultry, menacing desert, Elizabeth has a frightening experience with a strange, mysteriously inexplicable Indian. Elizabeth is told to say nothing of her experience. She complies, but has the feeling that she will see the Indian again and that he will know if she needs help. The company goes on toward the Colorado River. At Lee's Hogback there is an accident to one of the wagons, which careens from the ridge, and its two drivers and their goods go rolling down the steep ledge. 44 OLD the line! Keep moving!" Silas Smith shout- IT ed. "George, keep 'em on the move or we'll all go over!" "No one is hurt!" George cried. "The men are already cutting the teams free of their harnesses. Don't look down! Keep moving, straight to the top!" Page 254 "Ever)' man to the front who is not driving a team," Silas ordered. "Hold the wagons on the trail by hand! We can't lose another out-fit!" Alternately urging and commanding, the two leaders succeeded in holding the line till the last wag-on reached the top of the spiked divide. There, five men were de-tailed to help get the broken wagon and the crippled teams back up the sliding ledge. The other men had held the wagons to the road by sheer force of numbers and de-termination. And then it was over. The ridge flattened out, its sides plumed up and slid away into the desert. The mammoth hog had reclined, needing no shade and no water for its rest. Once over the hogback, Elizabeth and Mary climbed wearily from their wagons and lifted their young-er children down beside them. "Lee's Hogback!" Mary exclaimed, and stood staring back at it. "Let it lie!" Elizabeth said curtly. "We have work to do! The children are clamoring for food, and the whole camp needs rest and water." "Water!" Mary exclaimed, "I'd give a bucket of gold for a drop of "George says we can only stop an hour, Mary. The sun is getting low and we have miles to go before we 'night camp' at Bitter Springs." Elizabeth was systematically arranging utensils and food for a quick meal for the men, and as she talked she worked rapidly. Mary spoke uneasily, "Oh, Elizabeth, what if there shouldn't be any water when we get to Bitter Springs." Elizabeth paused in her work to look at Mary. "Why, we'd just die, I guess," she said. "But the Lord has seen us over that place," she flung a defiant glance back at the hogback, "and my opinion is that he'll keep on lookin' after us. This is a mission. You remember in the Book of Mormon when Nephi and his brothers Laman, Lemuel, and Sam were sent back to Jerusalem to get the records from King Laban, Nephi Photograph by Walter P. Cottam 255 said: 'I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for 1 know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them." "That is good scripture," Mary agreed, and added emphatically, "the main company had better read that passage. They're going to need that kind of faith if they accomplish the thing they have been commanded _ "Do you wish we could have stayed to come with the main company?" Elizabeth asked, not looking at her friend and almost ashamed of the implied weakness. "Of course, I do," Mary answered. MONOLITH IN THE DESERT 256 Courtesy, Jen Dike Studio, Phoenix, Arizona NAVAJO SHEPHERDESS "I don't think the Lord will blame us, either. Someone has to go so it may as well be us. The men seem to tackle a job better if there are women along to fight for." Elizabeth said affectionately, "I wouldn't worry so if you weren't going to have a baby, Mary. You never have been strong." "That worried me at first, too, Elizabeth. But I'm getting stronger every day." And so they talked, snatching moments between their cooking, looking after each other's children, laughing at remembered things back home.... Twas midnight before they reached Bitter Springs. The brackish water did little to relieve their thirst, but they drank it and went to bed, exhausted, on the hot sand. Dawn comes early to the desert. The sun comes up, not leisurely as if it had rested well, but blazing wrathfully, discomfited by its bed of prickly-pears and sand. Tall cactus trees, brittle-looking as the rays of the sun, stretch their limbs and stand in resignation. With their thirst but bitterly satisfied, the heat soon became intolerable to the weary train which had started traveling before daybreak. The children cried and tossed fitfully from side to side in their rocking wagons. Long before noon the cattle were bawling their discontent, lowing dismally to their scattered calves. 'The horses were white with caked lather, and sweat and sand rimmed the bloodshot eyes of the men. But in spite of it all, they made thirty miles that day� only to find a dry camp that night. The next morning there was the same sun, the same blistering wind, the same hot sand in their eyes. And they had to go another thirty miles, without water, for the next spring had been dry. The cattle, tongues lolling and eyes bulging, refused to take another step and gave up beside the road, only struggling up and on again at the merciless prodding of the drovers, and then some of them falling dead a little farther along the way. Up and down the sluggish line rode George Hobbs and Silas Smith. "George, we've gone sixty miles without water," Silas cried. "A fourth of our stock is dead, and the men and women are but little better. What are we going to do?" "There's nothing to do but hold on and keep moving!" George yelled at the line: "Only ten miles more, and we'll roll in water! Keep moving! Keep movin Stoical g!" in the face of it, Elizabeth and Mary drove behind their men. Ten miles . . . nine . . . eight . . . and, at last, only one more mile. Water! Water! They prayed. The spring could not, must not be dry! The first men to reach Willow Spring sent up a shout and, almost Here is the exact OCR transcription of the text:
before their own thirst was satisfied, they began to fill their barrels, buckets, pans, and cups to take back to the parched ram in the rear. Some of the boys, laughing wryly, even filled their hats with the precious water and went staggering back to help their friends.
An hour later, half dead, the company pulled up at the spring. Night, drenched with unexpected dew, cooled their veins and healed their eyes with sleep. . . .
At the Indian village of Moenkopi President Smith was warned that his company would never be permitted to cross the Navajo Indian Reservation into San Juan. Hobbs, too, had been advised to turn back. They had met at a blacksmith's shop to pool their crews.
"They say it can't be done, Silas," George drawled, whittling away at a stick.
"Never mind what they say! What do you say?" Silas questioned hotly.
"I say it can," Hobbs replied, setting himself cross-legged in the shade of a squawbush near the shop. "But, Silas, we've got ten teams to shoe yet. The confounded Indians are slow as sorghum in winter. We've paid 'em in corn and shirts, now they want shoes and pants. They'll keep us here all summer!"
"Well, give 'em shoes and pants then, George."
"Whose, besides mine?"
Silas' eyes twinkled. "I used to warn 'em, buckskins," he said. "And where we're goin' there's not enough rain to worry about them shrinking." Then, serious again, he ground a rock to bits beneath his heel. "Give 'em any bloomin' thing they want, only let's get out of here!"
"I talked with John W. Young,"
George reported. "He's been here a good many months trying to build a woolen mill. So far he's met nothing but opposition all the way. He has Indians here are used to the whites, but, once we cross into San Juan, we'll be in their territory and they'll fight us every step of the way."
"We knew that when we started out, George. And I can't say that I blame the Indians. They haven't forgotten the drubbing they got from Kit Carson and the Government. And, furthermore, it is still fresh in their minds that the whites have just killed four of their young men."
"The white men who were responsible for that were not Latter-day Saints, Silas."
"That will make little difference to the Indians," Silas answered. "With them, it's still an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
"Well," George drawled, "Brigham Young was famous for goin' where folks said he couldn't. I reckon he told me! like to hear a son of his say that a call of the Church can't be fulfilled."
Mr. Young spoke sincerely. George. He firmly believes that we'll not get twenty miles inland from the river."
"Have you talked with Brother Wilford Woodruff, Silas?"
"Yes. He came to my camp last night and brought some missionaries with him. They are to preach to the Indians and help us out."
"Good! We'll take them right up to old Chief Peegarrent and introduce them to him," George said.
Silas smiled. "We can use the missionaries, all right. But what we need right now, George, is grain and wagon parts."

George reminded him that there were no wagon parts, and precious little grain in Moenkopi. "But there is wool," *he added. "Could we use any of that?" "Wool makes good pads for horses' sore shoulders, George. Take that and anything else you can get around here." Silas sat down beside George in the scant shade of a squawbush. "I'm worried, George," he admitted. "There are plenty of white trappers and traders who would stir up trouble around here, even if the Indians were inclined to be peaceable." George poked a deep hole in the sand with his forefinger. He picked a centipede off his sleeve and dropped it into the hole. "Yep. They're as poison as that critter I just buried," he declared, tamping the sand into the hole with angry jabs. They were silent for a minute and then George continued, "I've been thinking about Mrs. Davis, Silas." "We'd better leave the Davises here, George," Silas replied. "And leave Mrs. Harriman to take care of Mrs. Davis?" "No. We have to have one woman along to help keep the hotheads in check. They are itchin' to start shootin' as it is." "T guess you're right, Silas, but it will be hard on the woman. I'll see that the Davises are taken care of here. And we'd better leave the stock here, too. We'll have enough to do to look after our own hides." "That's the size of it," Silas agreed. "The sooner we hit the trail the better, too. The hardships of travel. Road building, and well digging 259 will help to keep dissatisfaction down." The two men rose and shook hands, then each went his own particular way, George to get the outfits in shape for the rough roads ahead, and Silas to procure funds and food for his men. To a woman there is no greater loneliness than being alone with a crowd of men, even when a husband and brothers are along. Women afford each other kinship that the company of men does not supply. Elizabeth helped Mary get settled in the large tent that the men had put up, and everything she did - showed her solicitude. She made beds, cooked, and sewed, and left a blessing with each one of the homely tasks. Tears often welled in Mary's eyes as she lay on her bed and watched Elizabeth's deft hands. "I'll miss you, Mary," Elizabeth confessed. 'The last task was finished. There was nothing more to do but talk as casually as they could and pretend to have the courage expected of them. Mary could not say goodbye to Elizabeth. "It's not goodbye, it's adios," she said bravely. "I'll be joining you soon. James says it will only be a few weeks." Elizabeth agreed, smiling for Mary's benefit. But she had a disquieting sense that things would never be the same with them again. Once they reached their destination, each one would settle on her own land and their houses might be miles apart. She would see Mary again, that was practically sure, but it would be different. They would never be as close to each other in the new settlement as they had been 260 while traveling to get there. But whatever came, she promised herself, she would always love Mary and pray that their two lives might go on together. FOR two uneventful days the company drove over drab desert sand, making ten miles each day. Nothing unusual happened;' then, suddenly, fear was all around them. It was nothing they could see or hear or touch, yet it was there. It followed the train in shadow by day and stalked it by night. This was a country of such vast silences that the small noises of the wheels as they churned the sand, were distracting. The creak of leather and chain was cymballed against the towering cliffs, as the wagons were catapulted from table land to canyon bottom, adding to the fear and the mystery of the unknown. "We are surrounded, Silas," George Hobbs said grimly, riding beside Silas, his eyes straight ahead. "They have been gathering for days. Ever since the first three miles out." "Indians?" Silas asked, showing no surprise. "I guess that's what I've been smelling. Our own campfire smells could hardly carry that strong." They rode in silence again, keeping close watch on all sides. Presently Silas spoke. "Where do you suppose those four scouts we sent out are keeping themselves? I should have had a report of this gathering. If there is an ambush�" "There won't be," George interrupted. "Chief Peogament hasn't joined his tribes yet. He knows what the water layout is, and he figures the rain gods will take care of us and save him the trouble. His hordes are following us to pick our bones." An hour later the train climbed out of the canyon and came to a sudden halt. Not more than fifty feet from the mouth of the canyon a forest of greasewood blocked their way. Miles wide, dense as fog, gnarled, and as twisted and tangled as the tentacles of an octopus, it confronted the astonished company. "T calculate that Peogament's got more on his side than his rain gods," Silas decided, stopping dead in his tracks. "I reckon we're here for some time. We had better start digging a well." George's eyes were glued to the thicket. He sat his horse erect and watchful. "It doesn't look promising," he agreed curtly. "There is double meaning in your words, George. What do you see?" "A thicket," George answered. "What do you see?" "A thicket," Silas replied, nettled out of his usual good-natured drawl. "A very deep thicket!" The company pulled up beside its leaders, staring incredulously at the forest. "Whatever that forest holds is its own secret now," Silas said, looking at George for enlightenment. But he got no response. "Make camp!" he shouted. "And pull in close together. Guards out!" Elizabeth covered her face with her hands. "I'm glad you are not here, Mary," she whispered to the great stretches of broken country that lay between her present dark camp and the warmth and security of Mary's tent. "I'm glad you are not here, waiting for what the night, or the dawn, or tomorrow's dawn may bring!" (To be continued) THE PRESS V IEWS MORMONISM AS A ZIONIST MOVEMENT Elder James R. Clark Brigham Young University Copyright 1947 (Third installment of a series of articles survey of some three thou; sand newspaper articles writ ten about the Latter-day Saints between 1824 and 1850, shows that editors and writers were interested in Mormonism for the sons that widely differed. Some editors were concerned only with the political aspects of Mormonism; others were concerned with the social and economic implications of the movement, still others seemed to delight only in vituperation an religious controversy. There is one recurring theme, however, that appears in newspaper be expressed as "Mormons take over." Newspaper editors seemed to have a firm conviction that the Latter-day Saints were attempting to "take over" America as their Zion, and the repeated publication of this conviction preceded the main body of Latter-day Saints 0" their westward journey from New York to Ohio, Ohio to Missouri, Missouri to Illinois, and even to California. Preceding them, it temper ed the thinking of the newspaper the Latter-day Saints intended to settle. Dealing with early Latter-day Saint history ) The teachings of the early Church saints were the "chosen people of God," whose right it was to inherit such a land, have been recorded as facts by both Mormon and non Mormon historians. The part played b can press in interpreting this concept to the American people, and the repercussions of this interpretation on the Mormon movement have been largely overlooked by historians. The doctrine of the "land of Zion �an inheritance'" was given as direct revelation from God to Joseph Smith, January 2, 1831, at a conference of the Church held in Fayette, New York. It read in part: And I have made the earth rich, and behold it is my footstool, wherefore, again I will stand upon it. And I hold forth and deign to give unto you greater riches, even a land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey, upon which there shall be no curse when the Lord cometh: And I will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance, if you seek it with all your hearts: And this shall be my covenant with you, ye shall have it for the land of your inheritance, and for the inheritance for Page 261 262 your children forever, while the earth shall stand, and ye shall possess it again in eternity, no more to pass away (Doc. And Cov. 38:17-20).; The Prophet Joseph Smith and his family had been "in the news" since 1824, and were well known by 1831. I think it safe to assume that immediately following the giving of this revelation, containing a pronouncement of the destiny of Mormonism, Latter-day Saints began to interpret this concept to their neighbors and friends. Newspaper editors, picking up news of the growing Mormon movement, began their own interpretations of this new doctrine of Zion. Six months after the revelation had been given in New York, the St. Louis Times, St. Louis, Missouri, in its issue of July 9, 1831, carried an article from the Western Courier, Ravenna, Ohio, for May 26, 183:, which said: We understand that a new arrival of Mormonites has taken place�some two hundred men, women and children having lately landed in Geauga county, their holy land, from New York. It is said that they are an active, intelligent and enterprising sect of people. They have commenced a new settlement in the township of Thompson, near the line of Ashtabula county, thus extending their holy land farther east than the limits originally fixed.... The number of believers in the faith, in three or four of the northern townships, is said to exceed one hundred� among whom are many intelligent and respectable individuals, Two months later, on September 17th, the Missouri Intelligencer and Boone's Lick Advertiser, which was published in Columbia, Boone County, Missouri, republished a news item from the Painesville Gazette, Painesville, Ohio, as follows: THE MORMONITES ~� We learn from the Painesville Gazette, that this infatuated people are again in motion. In their own cant phrase, "they are going to inherit the promise of God to Abraham and his seed." Their destination is some indefinite spot on the Missouri River, they say, about 1,500 miles distant. One group of Latter-day Saints did move to their "promised land" in Missouri. With them, at the ex: press wish of the Prophet Joseph Smith, went a printing press and William Wines Phelps, a recent convert to the Church, a printer and publisher of wide experience. There might have been a dual meaning in the publication of the following extract from a history of Connecticut which Mormonism's first editor printed in the first issue of the first periodical�The Evening and Morning Star, published in the new "Zion" at Independence, Missouri:  The following is found in an ancient history of Connecticut. Soon after the settlement of New Haven, several persons went over to what is now the town of Milford, where, finding the soil very good, they were desirous to effect a settlement; but finding the premises were in peaceable possession of the Indians, and some conscientious scruples arose as to the propriety of deposing and expelling them. To test the case a church meeting was called, and the matter determined by the solemn assembly of the sacred body. After several speeches had been made in relation to the subject, they proceeded to pass votes�the first was the following:�Voted, that the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof. This passed in the affirmative; and, Voted, the earth is given to the Saints.�this was also determined like the former�3d. Voted, that we are the Saints, which passed without a dissenting voice, the title was considered indisputable, and the Indians were soon compelled to evacuate the place and relinquish the possession to the rightful owners. this little extract from an old history book, when published in a new Church paper in a new country, into which the Latter-day Saints were just moving, might have been misinterpreted boy the editors, and by readers who were not cognizant of the fact that the saints had received specific instructions to acquire all their land by regular  processes in obedience to the laws of the land. The news of the Mormon "Zion" in Missouri spread rapidly. Three months after the establishment of The Evening and Morning Star, the September 1, 1832 issue of Niles Weekly Register, a paper with nationwide circulation, published at Baltimore, Maryland, carried this news item: MORMONS� Two preachers of this sect have lately visited Boston, and soon made 15 converts to their strange doctrines� some of whom are respectable persons� also joined at Lynn. Certain of these converts have cast  considerable sums of money into the stock, and all were about to depart for the "promised land" in Jackson County, Missouri � the precious spot having been lately discovered. Although it was not the only cause of the failure of the Latter-day Saints to establish a permanent Zion, first in Ohio and then in Missouri, this opposition of the non-Mormon press was perhaps a contributing factor to their failure, because it determined to a large extent the type of co-operation, the saints, as new settlers, received from the older, established settlers. That the blame, if such there be, does not lie wholly at the door of the non-Mormons is implied in a statement written by the Prophet Joseph Smith for another Mormon paper, The Latter-day Saints Messenger and Advocate, September 1835: But to return to my subject . . . and thus the sound of the gathering, and of the doctrine, went abroad into the world; and many, we have reason to fear, having zeal not according to knowledge, not understanding the pure principles of the doctrine of the church, have no doubt, in the heat of enthusiasm, taught and said many things which are derogatory to the genuine character and principles of the church, and for these things we are heartily sorry, and would apologize if an apology would do any good. If it can be said that the saints failed to establish their Zion in Ohio and Missouri, their failure seemingly did not dim their spirit. One might, with justification, apply to them the earlier words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, spoken of himself: For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation ( Joseph Smith 2:25). They believed in the reality of the 'land of Zion," and they were not to be daunted by their own weaknesses and failures in Ohio and Missouri, nor by outside opposition and persecution. They built their own city in Illinois, and at Nauvoo, they were virtually autonomous. In this city of Zion, they took great pride, so it is understandable how, at the opening of the Prophet Joseph Smith's Nauvoo House, they felt impressed to pass a series of resolutions extolling the greatness of their leader and of their city of Zion. But these resolutions, published in the Times and Seasons, were 264 picked up by the nation's press as a further indication of What they felt was Mormon arrogance and a "chosen people" complex. The news of the Prophet's death, in 1844, was widely publicized, as outlined in the second installment of this series. The first opinion of the press, generally, was that with the Prophet's death, Mormonism and the attempts to establish Zion Were at an end. The Alton Telegraph, Alton, Illinois, said in October, 1844: DISSOLUTION OF THE MORMON CHURCH - - � The elements of The elements of discord and disunion are successfully at work in the community at Nauvoo, and no doubt rests upon our mind, but that the total dissolution of the Church will be the inevitable result .... With the fall of the "prophet," fell also the throne of despotism he had erected in this Republic, and the charm that enabled him to delude the populace has with his death, departed, we trust, forever. Mormonism departed from Illinois, but not from existence, as the editors had hoped it would. With the decision of the Latter-day Saints to remove West, came a revival of the Zionist fear so far as the press of the United States was concerned. This renewed interest on the part of the press may have been stimulated, in part, by an article which John Taylor published in the Times and Seasons, November 15, 1845. An imperial edict has been  issued in China, giving Christian missionaries liberty to preach, and the Chinese freedom to embrace Christianity ....This will open the door for the Elders of the Latter-day Saints and as our future location will embrace California, Oregon, or Vancouver's Island, we may bring the Chinese with their wealth, directly into the Kingdom of God, to "build up the waste places of Zion," without molestation. The Lord is certainly preparing the way for all nations to go up to his holy mountain, and worship Him in the beauty of holiness. Mormonism is here a little and there a little, until the whole lump be leavened. Some of the saints did go to California with the Mormon Battalion, and with Samuel Brannan. This revived the Zionist concept in the press once more and the Galena Gazette, Galena, Illinois, published a letter dated October 1, 1847, from a correspondent in California, in which fear was once more expressed that the Mormons were attempting to "take over" the country. The country is flooded with Mormons. Their regiment under Col. Cook, has been disbanded . . . besides this, Mormon emigrants are arriving daily, by sea and land, from Europe and America � all bringing arms and ammunition to fight, as they say, �the battles of the Lord,� and relieved their afflicted brethren from the persecutions and bondage of the Moabite, and to build up an inheritance to the Lord in the wilderness. These articles are only a selected few out of thousands which I have copied from newspapers covering the entire nation. I have sought to make the selection representative. In them there is evidence of the persistent efforts of the saints to carry out the will of the Lord and establish Zion. There is also evidence that the press of the nation seemed to be convinced that the "Mormon Zionist" movement promised no good for the residents of those areas in which the Latter-day Saints wished to settle. This attitude of the press undoubtedly increased the difficulties of Mormon settlement. MORMONISM IN THE EYES OF THE PRESS The important point to remember in any evaluation of Mormon history is that these accounts were published as the views, or intentions, of the Mormons. After careful study, I have no reason to doubt that the average citizen of New York, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri or California believed that 265 these newspaper accounts expressed the teachings of the Church leaders; the intentions of the Mormons to "take over' America and establish Zion; and to use force, if necessary, to accomplish their goal. The task of our pioneer forefathers was undoubtedly rendered more difficult by the opposition thus engendered. THE CHALLENGE OF A DAFFODIL Wanda W. Lund The icy, sleet-filled winds of March That drove the snow with shuddering blast Are quieted now. White mounds piled high, Like templed spires against the sky, Melt silently, and spring has come at last. Consider death�is it the end? Its icy hand will touch all men; And when our time on earth is through, Are we destined to live again? As surely as the springtime comes, And balmy days replace the chill, The spirit's triumph over death Exemplifies, through love and faith, The constant challenge of a daffodil. WEBER RIVER Beatrice K. Ekman The alder branches bend and quiver, And firmly anchored willows lean To trail slim fingers in between The rocks, where the eddying currents go In effortless motion of silver flow, Combing the banks of the mountain river; Ageless song of undertones... Ripple of water over stones... Select Safe Clothes C. Aileen Ericksen Director of Home Economics Education, Utah State Department of Public Instruction address may contribute to her bodily comfort, facilitating the activities of work and play. Throughout history, so strong has been the urge "to do as others do" - that women have accepted customs and styles of dress which were uncomfortable, which presented health and safety hazards, which limited activity, and which often were really ugly. Environment and activities direct one's choice of clothing. Most of us have had the experience of owning garments unsuited for our activities and environment. Velvet lounging pajamas owned by a girl who must help with the work of her home and has neither time for lounging nor a setting suitable for luxurious fabrics; swimming suits owned by the person who never swims; and riding jodhpurs prized by the girl who neither rides nor hikes�all are examples of purchases of garments that violate a rule of fitness. Aside from influencing the choice of article, the environment and activities also affect the colors, the fabrics, and the design deemed suitable. Perhaps the relation of environment and activity to clothing needs can be most wisely determined if the following steps are taken: 1. List all the activities in which you engage, making marks to designate relative frequency of each. 2. List the garments you will need to be properly dressed for these occasions. Page 266 3. On this factual basis, decide what influence each of the separate activities in which you engage should exert on your total clothing choices. 4. Plan so that the selection of clothing may also be influenced by safety features. The kind of clothing a woman wears, the way she keeps it in repair, and the style in which she wears her hair can affect her living to the extent that an accident may mean permanent injury or disfigurement. The style, fit, and material are important for safety. Let us consider several important items in this connection. 1. Projecting or flowing sleeves are not suitable for kitchen wear. They catch on chairs and door knobs, and also interfere in eating. They are especially dangerous when near a fire or when worn during the laundrying procedure. Short fitted sleeves are safe for household work. Those that are above the elbow are safest. 2. Large pockets, sashes, and bows, are especially bad when worn near cupboards and around stoves, for they catch on projecting objects and tend to tangle in flames. Pockets should be flat and should not extend away from the garment. Set in belts are safe because they are absolutely flat. Narrow flat bows are best; wide fluffy ones may catch on objects. 3. Long, large, and loose garments are tripping hazards. They are especially dangerous when the wearer is climbing or descending stairways. 4. Tight garments restrict movement. If clothes are tight they have a tendency to twist and get in the way when one stoops or climbs, and thus they contribute to fatigue.. SELECT SAFE CLOTHEs 267 Action-back blouses, or blouses with fullness, permit freer shoulder movements. Skirts should be moderately wide to allow free movement. 5. Wedgies, bedroom slippers, and dress shoes with high heels increase the danger of tripping. Poorly fitted shoes do not give proper support and often cause fatigue. Broken shoe laces may cause tripping. Shoe heels and soles should be kept in good repair. 6. Rayon and cotton napped fabrics that have not been given flame resistant treatment catch fire easily and burn rapidly. Extensive experiments have been conducted in making materials flame resistant, and when these are available on the market, another step will have been taken toward safety. Plan your spending to include all your wants� and to get what you want most for your money. Consider the type of clothes which you need, and consider the design with regard to the service which you expect. Consider the whole wardrobe and make the new purchases relate to it in safety, color, and becomingness� and, above all, let us follow the old rhyme when selecting clothes so that we may improve our techniques to gain the ultimate in quality when making our selections: Good, better, best Never let them rest Till your good is better And your better, best! CHASTISEMENT Genevieve J. Van Wagenen The tree held out The Woman of the Shawl C. Frank Steele MET her quite casually, the Woman of the Shawl. She must have been past seventy, and she was quite bent, but there was a radiance about her face that made it saintly. She reminded me of my own mother. 'The goodness of her heart shone through her kindly eyes. I can see her now, the Woman of the Shawl, going to church as faithfully as the good bishop himself. She never missed her Sunday School classes; she always said, "Living means learning." Always she went 'early. I remember meeting her one spring morning. The trees along the avenue were leafing out; the grass was showing green. The air was sweet and bracing. "Good morning! A perfect spring day?" It was the Woman of the Shawl. - She always wore a shawl, and she was smiling. There was a graciousness in her voice that warmed me. "It is�Mother," I said. The "Mother" slipped out quite unconsciously. But I could see it pleased her. "A rare morning, indeed. You go to church early." "Yes, always. I love the early morning air. Then I think that my going to Sunday School early might encourage others to do the same. I think one gets a little closer to God in the early morning. It's so quiet." And down the street, toward the little church on the corner, she walked. Page 268 And isn't this I met her again. It was in the summer, and although the day was new, the sun was warm. "Good morning!" she cried. "Isn't it grand to be alive?" "It is, Mother, but aren't you suffering from this terrific July heat we are having?" I asked. "Not at all. You see, I even have my shawl around me. Somehow, I cling to it the year round. We are such good friends. I feel lost without it. And then, how could one complain of anything when one has a bed of pansies like this?" And she pointed to a mass of lovely blooms at her feet. Her eyes fairly feasted on them. I had not noticed them before. It was autumn, and our pansy bed was a bit forlorn and faded and the trees were shedding their first yellow and gold leaves. There was a first hint of frost in the air; the call of the birds was wistful. It was on such: a morning that I again met the Woman of the Shawl, and, curiously enough, we met at our pansy bed. I had always called it "our pansy bed," after that 'summer meeting. Her greeting was that same happy "Good morning!" And she added, "How nippy the air is!" "Nippy it is, Mother. We're already well into autumn, and isn't it a shame our pansies must die? Life is cruel that way, Mother," I said. She looked at me. "No, my son, life is not cruel. Nothing is lost. Life is kind, if we are kind. Even THE WOMAN OF THE SHAWL in January, under the snow, everything seems dead. But there is life there. It is so comforting to know that, don't you think?" And I confessed that it was, as I left the brave little figure in the shawl. Came winter. The trees were bare, and a piercing wind was blowing out of the north. Under the deep snow lay our pansy bed. Would I meet her on a morning like this? Not likely, I thought, as I huddled deeper in my great coat and picked my way through the drifting snow. Suddenly, I spied her. Her head was down and she was picking her way through the snow. I noticed, too, that she was not alone this morning. Beside her trudged a small child, a girl. The child's hand was held firmly by the old woman, as, together, they faced the raw wind. I called, "Well, here we are meeting again! Good morning, Mother." "Tt is a bit stormy, but how white the snow is!" she answered. "I never 269 saw prettier snow.' Her voice was cheery. I looked closer. "But, Mother� the shawl, where is it?" She chuckled. "It's here." And she patted the head of the child. Sure enough, there it was, pinned about, the head of the round-faced girl by her side. "But, Mother, you are taking such risks. You should not have done this," I cried anxiously. She was ready with her answer, as she always was. "You see, my boy, Betty's mother is in the hospital. She�she has no father. She needed the shawl more than I did." We, the three of us, walked on together, silently. There were few abroad. I helped the old lady and the child along as best I could. It seemed to be growing colder. I looked down at the child and ventured, "My, Betty, this is a cold day, isn't it, dear?" She looked up at me out of the shawl and said, "It was, Sir, before Granny Mahoney came along." RECOMPENSE Berta H.

Color for the Centennial Summer Flowers for Attractive Displays and Ground Coverings Vesta P. Crawford THERE is still time to plan and plant flower gardens that will make Utah's Centennial summer bright with radiant color. By a careful selection of bulbs, plants, and seeds, it will be a delight for home gardeners to create brilliant displays of color that may be seen from the streets of our towns and cities, and from the highways and. Country roads in the rural districts. The Utah pioneers were garden-minded, and they loved flowers. The precious plants and seeds, brought from many lands and carried in handcarts and covered wagons across a thousand miles of wilderness, soon produced the flowers that bloomed inside the rock and adobe forts and graced the yards of the humble log cabins. The heritage of culture and beauty brought by the pioneers has been nourished in the mountain valleys, and this summer, particularly, should see a flowering of the pioneer tradition. In making garden plans, the preparation of the soil is of utmost importance, since a strong and rapid growth of plants is necessary for display purposes and massed bloom effects. Most flowers require a soil well cultivated and enriched with peat moss or old leaves, and a liberal application of old barnyard manure or commercial fertilizer. Where the soil is heavy clay, it will be necessary to add some sand, as well as humus and fertilizer to the original soil. Even the inexperienced gardener, in making a selection of summer Page 270 flowers, will note that certain blossoms which are lovely for indoor bouquets do not make the best displays to be seen from the street. Fragile columbines and anemones, for instance, do not lend themselves to massed color effects, and the delicate cosmos and the graceful flax flowers will not make a gorgeous panorama of color. Also, it is well to remember that flowers of a single color make a more effective massed display than a mixture of colors. Flowers for Borders The appearance of the yard and the garden can be greatly improved by an effective use of border plants. These are used to edge lawns, paths, steps, shrubs, rose gardens, lily pools, and to provide borders in front of taller flowers. In selecting colors for the border, it is necessary to decide whether a contrasting effect is desired or whether a blending pattern is preferred. Many gardeners use blue border plants, such as ageratum or lobelia, and plant a background of tall yellow or gold marigolds or calendulas. White alyssum or rock cress (arabis) may be used in front of a bed of rose-colored zinnias. Blending of colors may be secured by planting pale pink, dwarf snapdragons as a border in front of tall snapdragons of deeper shades of pink or rose. In choosing border plants, it is well to remember that bushy varieties make a much better mass effect than do the more spindly types of COLOR FOR THE CENTENNIAL SUMMER flowers. All plants should be closely spaced in order to secure a complete ground covering. Flowers of Medium Height Among the many flowers which produce striking massed color effects, the most popular are the many varieties of petunias. The fringed and double petunias which have recently been developed in many exquisite varieties do not present such a striking effect, at a distance, as do the more brilliant single petunias. The so-called dwarf petunias are bushy and make a compact and colorful display. Some of the favorite dwarf varieties are: Rose of Heaven (medium rose color) Velvet Ball (deep mahogany red) Royal Gem (rosy carmine) Bright Eyes (light rose pink) Glow (carmine red) Igloo (creamy white) Among the large flowered bedding petunias, the Black Prince (very dark red) and Blue Wonder (cornflower blue) are excellent for display purposes. Nasturtiums have long been favorites in home gardens. These flowers grow well in poor soil and may be planted on dry, sandy, or gravelly banks. The tall Glorious Gleam Hybrids and the dwarf varieties, Globe of Fire (flaming red), Indian Chief (vivid scarlet), Orange Gleam, and Primrose (yellow), all make gorgeous displays of striking color. Iceland poppies (which may be grown in partial shade), snapdragons, marigolds, calendulas, and zinnias may be used for massed bedding effects. They are all hardy and grow rapidly. However, snapdragons are rather difficult to grow from seed, except under very favorable conditions: and it is, therefore, advisable to buy plants for the snapdragon bed. Tall Flowers for Massed Bloom Perennial Shasta daisies are extremely hardy, and if planted in full sun and watered well, they will grace the early summer garden with the beauty of their dense whiteness. Even in poor soil near hedges or trees, these daisies grow vigorously. If the faded blossoms are cut immediately after blooming, new foliage will spring up and make a good ground cover. The gayest of the tall summer flowers is the phlox. It is advisable to secure phlox plants, since these flowers are difficult to raise from seed quickly enough to bloom the first year. Many varieties have large florets and heavy heads of bloom. The colors occur in various dainty "art" shades, but the deeper colors make more striking displays when viewed from a distance. Flash (rich, dark red), Charles Curtis (flaming scarlet), Border Queen (watermelon pink), Caroline Vandenburg (blue) make the richest massed color effects. Delphiniums, in many exquisite shades of blue, violet, and red, have been greatly improved within the last few years. Taller stems, with more brilliantly colored and more closely spaced florets, have been developed. They are now considered among the best flowers for perennial borders. Some of them grow as tall as six feet and produce immense flowers of great brilliance. Favorite varieties are: Blue Bird (clear, medium blue) Black Knight (dark violet) Summer Skies (light blue) Belladonna (turquoise blue) Cardinale (scarlet) HOLLYHOCKS, which were very popular in pioneer gardens, now present, in improved varieties, an even more stately and colorful appearance. Planted against fences, along the walls of garages and sheds, or massed against arbors or gate-posts, they make otherwise plain or unsightly places beautiful with radiant color. Some of the flowers look like great double roses and some resemble the rich and exquisite camellias. Hollyhocks have been called ''towers of beauty," and they are among the most easily raised garden flowers. A choice can be made from these gorgeous colors: Colorado sunset, black, deep salmon red, maroon, lilac, Newport pink, salmon, scarlet, rose, and yellow. Summer-floweiing Bulbs Very large and elegant are the cannas of summertime. They have wide, tropical leaves, and their blossoms are of unusual size and rich-ness. Dormant bulbs must be plant-ed early in the spring, but plants which have been started in pots can be set out from April into June, thus producing blossoms for many weeks. Favorite cannas are: King Humbert (scarlet) The President (very dark, glowing scarlet) Orange Humbert (flame colored) Yellow King Humbert (very deep yellow) Gladioli, if planted close together, and selected in the richer shades, make beautiful gardens which will attract attention from the street. A few bulbs may be planted each week, from April into summer, to give a succession of blossoms until frost. Many gardeners consider dahlias as the flower kings of the garden. Some plants grow six to eight feet tall and produce blossoms as large as dinner plates. The hurried gardener, however, should omit dahlias from his planting since they require care and cultivation, and many of them must be staked so that the large flowers can be adequately supported.
Many of the hardy lilies, the red Pardalinum giganteum, the coral lily, and the regal lily are stately additions to the flower garden, and they are particularly attractive for informal arrangements.
Hardy Flowers for Ground Cover
Many gardeners find that, in addition to their formal garden arrangements, there are plots of ground which are too large for intensive tending and cultivation. There are a number of hardy annuals which may be sown broadcast in these otherwise vacant spaces. California poppies, bachelor buttons, marigolds, calendulas, larkspur, and many other hardy flowers grow well with very little attention, and some of them do not require much irrigation. Candytuft, alyssum, and snow-on-the-mountain (Euphorbia), once planted, seed themselves year after year, and make a field of beauty so thick that even weeds find little opportunity for growth. Among perennial plants which make excellent ground covers are the various types of violets and violas, which do well in shaded localities and provide a thick carpet of beautiful greenery after the modest blossoms have faded.
Climbing Vines and Flowers for Backgrounds
Old fences, unsightly garages, sheds, and tool houses may be covered by quick-growing vines and flowers which make a beautiful background and camouflage the shabby structures that give an unsightly appearance to many yards. For this purpose, morning glories are an excellent choice. They will quickly climb a trellis, an arbor, a telephone pole, or a porch post, and they will make an ugly fence into a bower of beauty. If planted early, morning glories will provide a profusion of blossoms from July until freezing weather in the fall. Heavenly Blue morning glories are perhaps the most popular variety, but there are ruby red, rose red, white, and other beautiful colors. Morning glories thrive even in poor soil, but they need full sunlight.
Other flowering vines which make rapid and dense growth are: perennial sweet peas; cathedral bells (Cobaea), rapid climbers with bellshaped green flowers which turn to purple; cypress vine, with its lovely scarlet or white flowers; balloon vine (love-in-a-puff); moonflowers, which grow as tall as twenty-five feet and produce blossoms in many lovely colors; the cardinal climber, covered with a blaze of red flowers; and the popular fleece vine.
Gourd vines, with their shining foliage and varicolored fruits of strange and interesting shapes, make unusual and attractive background coverings, and the various types of flowering beans are useful for this purpose.
With foresight and planning, the Centennial gardens can be made into brilliant displays of color that will reflect the ideals of our garden-loving pioneers. A Reward for Cheerful Service A True Incident Lucinda M. Chidester Harrington It was a cold, bleak morning. Two Relief Society visiting teachers were driving along in an old, one-horse rig. The loose tires rattled as they bounced over the rough highway, throwing dirt and clods into the laps of the sisters. The decrepit, straw-fed horse needed constant urging to keep him moving. As the sisters shivered with cold, one asked, "I wonder if we do enough good to pay for all the freezing and thawing we go through, traveling fourteen miles to go around our district?" "Well, Sister Marble," the other teacher replied, "we are doing our duty, and I am always reminded of a memory gem given by one of the sisters, �Do your duty, that is best, leave unto your God the rest.� Just then the rig rounded a hill and the women saw a spiral of smoke rising from the chimney of a log cabin. "Well, it looks like Sister Nettie must still be in the valley; we must stop and see," exclaimed Sister Chidester. The cabin looked gloomy and dark, with a piece of canvas serving as the only door. On hearing the rig, a pale-faced woman came out to meet them, and burst into tears. As she talked between sobs, the sisters learned that her husband had left a while ago to find work in town, promising to return later for his family. But the days had grown into weeks and only that morning they had heard that he had left for parts Three pale little children huddled in a comer trying to keep warm, they were wearing shoes made from an old wagon cover and very thin and meager clothing. The mother said that for days they had had nothing to eat but some rice. The visiting teachers at once drove home as fast as they could, but soon came pack through the bitter cold in a whitetop, bringing flour, butter, and eggs from No Santa Claus was ever welcomed more joyfully than 'were those two humble Relief Society teachers that cold winter day, and no hearts were ever happier for having performed a simple duty in God's service.

NOTES FROM THE FIELD 277 AUSTRALIAN MISSION REPORT ON THEThe Australian Mission Magazine representative sends the following interesting comments: "In appreciation of the love, understanding, and great service rendered to us through Thewe, your sisters from 'Down Under,' wish to voice our appreciation. Under the guidance of the mission Relief Society presidents�Sisters Hazel B. Tingey, Florence Rees, Maude M. Judd, June Orme, and now again, our beloved Florence Rees, we have learned the value of the Magazine in our lives. In 1933 we had 39 subscribers in this mission. During the last drive, we attained the high quota of 305. Each branch Magazine agent has worked diligently to place the Magazine in many good homes, both of members and non-members of the Church. Without wishing to segregate any particular branch for special praise, I feel I would like to state that the Hurstville Branch has always shown outstanding progress in subscription sales. This branch has a membership of 23, and the subscriptions total 72. As several families have two members on the roll, I think this is a remarkable achievement. "The placing of such high class reading matter, with the broad religious outlook depicted within the pages of the Magazine, is a means for turning the key in the doors of people's homes and admitting the missionaries, who are again entering the field." KOLOB STAKE, (UTAH), SPRINGVILLE FIFTH WARD PARTY HONORING THE. VISITING TEACHERS, JUNE 9, 1946 This lovely party was held in the gardens at the home of Florence Reynolds, under the direction of President Alice Davis, First Counselor Barbara Francis, Second Counselor Elen Erdmann, and Secretary Helen Robbins. An interesting program was prepared by Nettie Thorne, Ella Reynolds, and Delphia Hardy. Stake Board member Malinda Sumsion presented a tribute of appreciation for the visiting teachers and each of these honored guests was given a rose corsage and a copy of the poem "the Visiting Teacher's Prayer," by Eva M.

The singing was under the direction of Zina Condie. Climaxing the program, Jesse Dalton gave three readings.

Hilliard, with an elevation over 7,000 feet, is in the high country eighteen miles from Evanston, A strong wind was blowing and the roads were rough and slippery. The ruts were deep, and, once in them, it was necessary to stay there. "We moralized, as we drove along, how true it was to life, how easy to get into a rut and how hard to get out of one. However, as_ we turned into the lane that led to the little church, a particularly slippery bypath showed that another car had already skidded off there into the ditch. Immediately, we followed suit and skidded, too, showing again that if others go astray, it is easy to follow their lead. Our men-folks got out and shoveled and tried to get the car onto the toad, but all in vain. An east wind was doing its best to make things more uncomfortable, when along came the good bishop and his family in their truck. So, with all hands to the NOTES FROM THE FIELD 281 rescue, we were finally on the way to the church. On reaching there, the men went in and kindled a fire. While we were waiting in the car the bishop's wife told of the many things they have to overcome in order to hold Relief Society meetings. Sometimes she comes on horseback, with one child back of her, holding on, and one in front. Then sometimes they come to Relief Society meeting in a wagon with the children on a bed of hay, covered with warm quilts. In spite of all these drawbacks, the Hilliard Ward Relief Society presented every lesson last year, gained two new members, completed their Welfare assignment, collected forty bars of soap for Europe, collected a box of clothing for the saints overseas, and gave a party for the returned servicemen. Two years ago the Hilliard Ward Relief Society sisters served an anniversary banquet when the temperature outdoors was forty degrees below zero. CENTRAL STATES MISSION, EL DORADO BRANCH (ARKANSAS) GENERAL BOARD BUILDING FUND CONTRIBUTION This novel, heart-shaped apron was recently sent to the office of the General Board of Relief Society. Various amounts of money were pinned on the apron as a contribution to the Relief Society General Board Building Fund. The sisters of the El Dorado Branch expressed in this way their loyalty to the Society and their co-operation in planning for a home for the general offices of the Relief Society. The sisters who made this contribution are: Birdie Wright, Cora Craig, Mable Griffin, Ima Adcox, Joe Elin Griffin, and Maude Flemmekin. Martha W. Brown is president of the Central States Mission Relief Society. 282 NORTHWESTERN STATES MISSION LAYETTE ASSIGNMENT Left to right: Elder Granville Oleson; Lenora K.

All eighty of the Relief Societies in the Northwestern States Mission participated wholeheartedly in the assignment, many of the organizations sending in double the number of articles requested. When the layettes were received at the mission home in Portland, the missionaries assisted Sister Bringhurst in sorting and preparing the layettes for shipment. Each package included three dozen diapers, six gowns, four short jackets, three shirts, four pairs bootees, four pairs of stockings, six receiving blankets, one large blanket, one set of wool bootees, bonnet, and jacket, one rubber sheet, one soaker, sheet blankets, and such incidentals as cotton, oil, powder, soap, and safety pins. PAROWAN STAKE (UTAH), CEDAR FIFTH WARD "BRIDES DAY" Annie C. Esplin, counselor in the Cedar Fifth Ward Relief Society, reports a "Brides Day" meeting which was held in December 1946. Corsages were presented to the bride married the longest and to the bride most recently married. The oldest woman present, Sister Jane Jones, had been married sixty-eight years, and the youngest woman had been married six weeks. One of the young mothers, Sister Lois Windsor, gave a very instructive and inspirational talk, a part of which is quoted here: "It is a privilege and an honor for me to engage in Relief Society work because I am entering the most important phase of my life � the establishment of a home and the rearing of a family. The success of my home depends upon the knowledge with which I meet my daily problems. In partnership with my husband, and with faith, love, understanding, and security, we have a good chance to create a harmonious world for our children. The home is the child's world."

I SHALL BE GLAD Jeanette P. Parry I shall be glad when spring unfolds her tapestries And daffodils sway down the garden walks; I shall be glad when meadow larks wake up the dawn And strutting robins give their courtship talks. I shall be glad when men, as brothers on the earth, Help guard the lambs within the shepherd's flock. When all the dormant earth pulsates with eager life, And cripples lay their crutches down and walk. It is not new, life from seeming death emerging. This constant challenge of the budding spring; He who gave his life upon the cross of Calvary, Now reigns supreme as Master, Lord, and King.
