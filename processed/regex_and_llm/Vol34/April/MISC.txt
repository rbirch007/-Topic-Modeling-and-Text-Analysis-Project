THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 34, NO. 4 APRIL 1947 MARY MAGDALENE Dorothy J. Roberts Seeing the lily's white petal hold Its tapered pistil, a wand of gold, And hearing the hymns of Easter drift Through sun-bright air of spring and lift The listening heart, I think of her, Mary of Magdala, the stir Of her garment as she knelt, the first In the garden when the pink light burst Its widening bloom above the dark Chasms of the Dead Sea, tinting the stark Mount of Jerusalem opal and pearl. I think of her watching the black night furl As she uttered the motif of sound to roll Into a world paean where glad bells toll. Little her woman's mind understood The mysteries. In the dew-wet wood, Seeing the stone had been rolled away And only his folded linen lay Limp in the tomb, little she knew Save his promises. As the palm leaf grew Sharper against a coral cloud, She could only weep and cry aloud To a Figure near in the dim half-light: "Where have you laid him?" Her face as bright As the eastern sky at his answering; To hear the voice of the Master ring Alive and resonant through her grief. I think of her rising in swift belief, Her rippled hair streaming in the dawn Her sandaled footsteps racing on, Faithful and unafraid, to fly Into the ages with her cry.?
