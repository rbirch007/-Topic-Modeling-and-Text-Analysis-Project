IN WAITING Eva Willes Wangsgaard Within an alabaster shell Are hidden feathers Songs, and Wings: Encased IN russet covers dwell The gold and green of many springs; Within a Pendant chrysalis A butterfly reclines From snowbanks warmed by April�s kiss Our wealth of silver streams will leap, The pioneer, Still journey-worn, Saw in the creeks his chance to live; The melting snow, to desert-born, The greatest gift the hills can give.
