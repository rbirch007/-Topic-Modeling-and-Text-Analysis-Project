THEVOL. 34, NO. 10 - OCTOBER 1947 PRAYER OF A PIPE ORGAN Julia Nelson Lord, I have breathed into still, tapered gloom, And light, unmasking muffled, weak despair, Has touched a wordless thought, a mute desire That soared, in purest harmony, to prayer; And I have rung white bells of sound to some Who walked in joy, perfecting their rich peace With music's benediction; through the years, An echoing comfort stayed, when rapture ceased. My chords are vibrant underneath the roll Of surging voices; when a thousand sing, I bear their last and holiest amen To thee.... An organ's reverent whispering. Lord, I am but an instrument, a frame, Cold hollow veins, mere wood and bone and steel; In all thy gifts to man, save yet for me This glorious power to show what others feel.
