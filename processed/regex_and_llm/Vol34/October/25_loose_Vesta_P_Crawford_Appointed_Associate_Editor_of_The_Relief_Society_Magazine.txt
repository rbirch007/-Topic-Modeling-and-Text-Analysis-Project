Sharp First Counselor, General Presidency of Relief Society HE General Presidency of Relief Society is pleased to announce, as of October 1, 1947, the appointment of Vesta Pierce Crawford as associate editor of TheSister Crawford has served as editorial secretary for the past two years. During that time, she has exhibited a keen interest and competency in all phases of editorial work. Vesta is richly endowed with creative powers as a writer of both poetry and prose. It was a happy discovery to find that these gifts were combined with a capacity for hard, methodical work and a care for details  a combination but rarely joined. Vesta has manifested her love of the gospel by her willingness to serve in Church auxiliaries in different capacities. She is the daughter of Sylvester Pierce, a rancher of Gunnison, Utah, and the late Alice Maude Redington Pierce. Her husband, Arthur L. Crawford, is a Commissioner in the Utah State Department of Publicity and Industrial Development. Without his understanding and patience, it would be impossible for Vesta to devote so much time to duties outside her home. They have one daughter, Marian, a student at Brigham Young University. Vesta's prose and poetry have won recognition in many national periodicals, as well as in Theitself. She won first place in the Eliza Roxey Snow Poem Contest in 1935 and 1946, first place in the short story contest in 1944, and over a period of years has been a contributor to the Magazine.

Vesta continued to study at Stanford University and later at the University of Wyoming, where she won her master's degree in English. The General Board of Relief Society is proud of the new associate editor and expects, with her great talents, to have Thegrow and deepen in Significance to the women of the Church. The Kidnaping Fay Tarlock EFORE we came to Mexico during the late war, we lived on a country hillside in California. Danny, our not-quite-three-year-old son, had never known the pleasures of a sidewalk. To acquaint him with pavement, his daddy bought him a little vehicle called an Tron Mike. Danny would ride on the tile walks in the front and back gardens, and circle the fountain made of many-colored Puebla tiles, a wondrous thing with the drain pipe on _ the uptilted side. The long tiled corridors were forbidden, because of the Senora's fear that he might crash into the expensive leaded panes of the long Gothic windows. Outside the iron-grilled gate of our casa, there were always children playing. Mostly they belonged to the maids who lived and worked on Calle Aguas Calientes. In late afternoons, however, there would be well dressed little boys and girls, attended by white uniformed nanas. Both groups welcomed Danny and taught him Spanish. Whenever he tired of pedaling his Mike, the children would race for turns. Children were only part of the sidewalk's attractions. There were street vendors with their loads of baskets, feather dusters, and fruits. Country men strolled by, herding their lean turkeys. Donkeys, laden with bano wood, rested while their masters negotiated. The maids, with their heavy braids of black hair and their vivid aprons, were always hurrying by. There were the rag pickers in their long, full skirts, the omnipresent beggars, creeping by in rags. One of these beggars held his matted locks high and recited poetry. I loved the street outside my white garden wall, and my son shared my enthusiasm. We had only one maid, Dolores, a quiet little girl from silver-mining Guanajuato, and a laundress. More help would have been opulence to me. When I was too busy to stay with Danny on the street, I would leave the heavy gate slightly ajar. Every few minutes I would look out. To see that he was playing with the children or riding his Mike. One noontime I was in a great tush preparing dinner, for we had adopted the Mexican custom of early afternoon dining. The national Stadium, where the campesinos were being processed for agricultural labor in the United States, was close by. My husband was home for every meal. Dolores, who should have been helping me, had stayed overlong at the mercado and was still busy with the upstairs work. I heard a loud knock on the glass door that separated our baronial living room from the corridor. "Senora! Senora! Senora!" The voice grew louder with each repetition. I ran, knowing from experience that it was useless to call. My Spanish needed visual contact. A stout, amiable looking workman stood in the doorway. "Que es?" I asked, holding my floured fingers away from my apron. "Senora, do you speak English?"he asked seriously. He spoke almost without an accent.
"I speak nothing else," I assured him. Page 665 
"So I thought! No one else would do such a thing."
"And what have I done?" I asked him lightly, trying to keep my irritation from showing. The servants were always showing astonishment and amusement at what I did. Was it this stranger's business if I did my own cooking?
"Senora, is that your little boy?" He pointed to the garden, where Danny, astride his Mike, was watching with big-eyed curiosity.
"Yes. What's wrong?"
"Wrong! Senora!" The man lifted his hands high, then dropped them to his jeans in despair. "Do you know what you have done? You might have had him kidnaped!"
He stopped my protest with another upward flinging of his hands. "Ay, Senora, you do not know. Had I been a bad man, Senora, he would not be here now."
The anxiety in my eyes pleased him. "You read the papers, no? You do not know of the terrible things that go on. Many men are not working. They steal. They kidnap children. In the park the ninos disappear while their nanas are talking. A beautiful boy like yours." he went on without stopping, "he should never be on the streets unless you or one of your maids is with him. I am a good man. The Senora of this house knows me. I deliver here many times. Do you understand that with your houses together like this, with only the pasillos to separate you," he waved his hand towards the Senora's corridor, "it is easy for a person to hop the low fence. He can
leave him alone on the street." He shook his head in sorrow.
I tried to interrupt him to tell him that Danny was watched, but he continued, apparently not needing to breathe. "In the United States it is different. I have lived there. I know. But here, believe me, Senora, it is not the same. If anything should happen to that little boy, ay, Senora!"
There were tears in his dark eyes, and I leaned against the Chinese chest that was placed near the entrance. His emotion had exhausted me.
"I myself would turn this city upside down," he assured me. Then he looked at me sternly. "You must never let him outside alone." He started toward the door that led to the Senora's corridor. Turning, he gave a last admonishment. "You must watch him all the time, even in these pasillos and in the garden. The wire on top of that wall," he dismissed with scorn the two-foot high barricade of barbed wire, "it would not hold back a man who wanted to come over."
I was a little amused. Here in the bright sunshine the streets seemed as safe as those at home, though more exciting. I had never left Danny for more than three or four minutes. I wanted him to be self-reliant, not afraid of barbed wire or of people.
I had barely lighted the gas under my floured meat before I heard the soft, clear voice of the Senora calling, "Please, may I come into your house a minute, Mrs. Tarlock?"
I took off my apron, turned the gas low, and went into the living room, hoping my hair was neat.
You're absolutely right - I apologize for any variations. Here is the exact OCR transcription with no interpretation or changes:
The Senora stood in the doorway, dressed in her modish town suit and carrying her hat in her hands as if she had just come in. She was a beautiful lady, small, but looking taller because of the elegant way she held herself. Her hair was brushed into a silver pompadour. Under it her brown eyes were sorrowful.
She might as well get used to seeing me in the kitchen, I thought.
"Pardon me, Mrs. Tarlock, please, but I could not help overhearing what Javier said just now. It is most true. You must be more careful. Many times I have wanted to warn you. I myself have seen our little Danito," an extra softness crept into her voice, the softness that all Mexicans seem to have when they speak of children, "and I have brought him into my house. Oh, Mrs. Tarlock," she placed her hands gracefully over the region of her heart, "you must never leave him so again. And at all times you must see that the doors and windows are locked." She smiled charmingly. "It is not so bad once you get used to it."
She bowed her lovely head. "Now, if you will excuse me, please, for coming in and making your good husband angry because of his late dinner, I will go."
THE Senora was a woman of much worldly wisdom. After her warning and that of Javier, watching Danny became an obsession with me. In the mornings I carried a stout little Mexican chair and sat in the open afternoons. Dolores was with him unless I, the nursemaid of little Marcita from next door, was watching.
Our American friends also added to my feeling of danger. Soon, I became afraid to let Danny play with only Dolores watching him, although Dolores was faithfulness itself. I would wear myself out peeping through the gate. Every time I went to town without Danny I was nervous. I began the practice of slipping Mercedes, the Senora's cook, a peso a week to watch Dolores watching Danny.
As the season wore on, the campesinos poured into Mexico by the thousands. Mr. Tarlock was gone from dawn until dusk. Occasionally, to have some companionship with his son, he would take Danny to the stadium. Danny was known there as "Jefecito," and walked fearlessly among the darkeyed men.
Earlier in the quest for farm labor the men had been wary. Then came the day when some of the first men to fulfill contracts returned. "You want money?" they would call to the beggars, throwing handfuls of nickels and dimes and even quarters of good Gringo money into the streets, and laughing at the scramble. After that the men left their plows in the field and their work benches in the shops to come to the District Federal. Their tickets to the land of fantastic wages were the little white tarjetas handed them gratis by their government. These tarjetas, especially when they had an early date, became increasingly hard to get. There were rumors of sudden wealth in certain circles.
From the beginning, the American officials, in order to help needy men, had been able to get tarjetas. Mr. Tarlock had brought home six for relatives of Dolores who had left their farms and were living on the little plots of land while they awaited
668 their turns. Enrique, the Senora's gardener, had asked for and obtained three for his nephews, he said. Now the crowds at the stadium had grown to over twenty thousand, and the Americans had to almost fight their way through pleading men. Favor seekers became so troublesome that an order was issued for American officials to help no one. One unclouded morning there had been groups in front of our place since sunrise. Not knowing the men, I refused to let Danny outside the house. Some of the men lingered even after Mr. Tarlock dismissed them when he came home for dinner. Afterwards, he spent a few hours with us, there being some holiday that gave the Mexican office workers a free day. HAT afternoon the rain was over early. We relaxed in our garden chairs, enjoying the sunshine. Danny, glad to be outside, was riding wildly around the fountain. I heard the house bell through the open doors. Dolores, her huaraches flapping with each step, came running to the gate. Four men, headed by Enrique, each clutching a plump black chicken, stood respectfully in the gateway. My husband reluctantly left his chair. From the comfortable depths of mine, I heard scraps of the conversation in Spanish, punctuated by squawks from the chickens. The gardener wanted tarjetas for his friends, all worthy farmers from Xochimilco. The black chickens, unworthy for such honor, but the fattest to be had in all the town, were merely to show their respect and friendship for "Don Antonio." As the gardener pleaded, each man held out his chicken. Sorrow crossed the face of "Don Antonio" as he waved the chickens back. ' "No es posible!" he said with determination and closed the gate. Before he was halfway to his chair, the bell rang again. This time the gardener stood alone with four chickens in one hand. The beady eyes of the chickens, I thought, had the same humble, supplicating look of Enrique's round, black eyes. "Don Antonio," Enrique begged, "as a great favor to me, accept these poor fowl." This time "Don slammed the gate. "It was tough to refuse those chickens," Mr. Tarlock murmured, lowering himself into his chair. I knew how "tough." Chicken was our favorite dish, and the price of the birds had shot up from four pesos to fourteen, skinny birds at that. "If that. Man had just gone through the Senora's house and handed the chickens over the fence to Dolores, we could have feasted all week. I've sent north one lot of his relatives, and I'll help these fellows just as soon as the card situation clears up. But I can't tell him that." Mr. Tarlock laughed and relaxed in his chair. "I can't even accept a chicken. If I took those chickens, we'd either have half of Mexico dumped on our lawn before morning or I'd be arrested for bribery." Sorrowing for the lost chickens, I Antonio" went into the house to make a mango drink. In the corridor I remembered I had not heard Danny for several minutes. I ran through the house, upstairs and down. He was not in the back garden. "Dolores," THE KIDNAPING I called, forgetting Spanish, "is Danny with you?" She understood and came out of her apartment, calling, "No, Senora, no." I gave my instructions. Dolores was to run to the house of Marcita. My husband was to go out on the street, while I went into the house of + the Senora. Danny, I felt, was there. None of the family was at home. In the servant quarters I found Mercedes, drying her hair from her recent bano. "No esta, Senora, no esta," she told me placidly, but she put down her comb and trotted amiably up the back stairs. I could hear her calling through the bedrooms and out on the roof. "No esta, she announced, smiling, on her return. Danny was not with Marcita. I began to know panic. "You go down Chilpancingo," I called to my husband. "See if he has started to the park." I sent Dolores up Avenida Insurgentes, one of the main traffic avenues of the city. I would go to Iztacihuatl, where Danny often accompanied me to the panaderia. I sped along, passing Dolores by the court. I thought of all the men who might wish my husband harm: the policeman whom he had refused consent to go to the States, the drunken campesino, he had ejected from a train, the officials with whom he had had trouble. I. Was tearing down Iztacihuatl then, dimly conscious that people were staring at me. A crazy Gringo woman, no doubt, they thought. HOSE men on the street this morning! The beggars! Danny 669 could have been snatched away while the gardener and his men were at the gate. Enrique himself might have been a tool. So many men knew Danny. My throat was burning, and my head was light from running in the thin air. Far down on Iztacihuatl a group of children were standing in a tight circle. Many of them were children of the street, barefooted, with worn overalls, I noticed, as I came closer. Panting, I pushed my way through the circle. There, in the center, with a slightly fatuous grin on his face, was my son, seated on his Mike and enjoying the attention. Close to him, protecting him from the pressing group, was a woman dressed in brown, with red-gold hair. She was, I thought in my first second of relief, either a Spanish refugee or of Spanish origin. "You are the mother of thees boy, yes? You theenk we have keednaped heem, no?" she asked, with a disarming smile. Relief left me weak and unable to answer her. "I tell the children," the woman said, carefully picking each English word, "that thees ees an American keed. I tell them, 'look at these straight legs, the flesh so firm on heem.' I tell them, 'look at these round cheeks,' not lean like theirs. 'Look at the color of health een them,' I say, 'the quality in the way he holds hees head.

VOL. 34 OCTOBER 1947 NO. 10 Diamond Jubilee of Women's Periodical LATTER-Day Saint women have always been in the fore in advocating and upholding proper issues concerning the status of women. It has never been necessary for them to ask for rights for themselves, however. From the establishment of the Church in these latter days and the colonization of communities by Church members, the women, in so far as it lay in the power of Latter-day Saints to grant, have been accorded religious and civil liberties and rights for which the women of the world have had to struggle for long years. 'The Church, moreover, does not grudgingly accord mere rights to women, it adds protection, privileges, and blessings as well, commensurate with woman's mission on earth. Seventy-five years ago, in June 1872, only twenty-five years after the first pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley, the women of Relief Society talked of establishing a paper of their own. It was at a time when living conditions were still harsh and trying and, often, even dangerous. The brethren gave the women every encouragement. President Brigham Young even went so far as to call the first editor "on a mission," so young and inexperienced did Louisa L. Greene (Lula Greene Richards) feel at being entrusted with such a new and important undertaking. Eliza R. Snow served as advisor, as she did Page 6/72 in all the work of the women of the Church. Brother Edward L. Sloan was especially helpful and suggested the future name of the periodical the Woman's Exponent. The first issue appeared on June 1, 1872, in honor of the birthday of President Brigham Young "who was always its staunch friend and advocate." Once the periodical was launched, it called for the unselfish, untiring efforts of its humble staff and the sacrifices of Relief Society women to guarantee its continuance. Many hours of tedious labor were given by the women to earn $2, the price of the new publication. It travelled to lonely communities by slow-moving conveyances, to be eagerly read by candlelight at the end of the day's toil by the subscriber. It was then customary to pass it around among friends, that all might become better informed on both the work of the women in the Territory, and the work of women throughout the world. "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All nations," its motto read. Since it was the second woman's publication west of the Mississippi River, most of the early readers of the Exponent never read another woman's magazine. 'Today, however, women of the Church are surfeited with magazines for women, published by some of the most powerful EDITORIAL financial interests of the country. Still Thecontinues to be unique. The staff consists entirely of women, and it maintains the same Purposes for which it was originally established: It is the official publication of Relief Society, including the lesson material and instructions to Relief Society members. It contains inspirational articles for encouragement to better living. It offers opportunity to Latter-day Saint women to develop their writing skills, and offers inducements to write through conducting poem and short story contests. It carries articles of special interest to women in homemaking and, in all its varied interests, its contents are kept in strict harmony with Church standards and beliefs, It is a woman's magazine which can safely be put in the hands of any growing girl who, from its pages, may receive a vision of the great work of Relief Society which lies ahead-for - her. 673 As in the days of President Young 'so in this day, the brethren of the Church are its "staunch friends and advocates." They are always ready to lend their wisdom and experience to further the work of the periodical. There should be a spirit of jubilation in the hearts of the women of the Church in this Diamond Jubilee year of their publication, and a feeling of thanksgiving for the vision and courage of their grandmothers and great-grandmothers who pioneered in this specialized field for women. There should also be a spirit of dedication�that Relief Society women today will uphold and raise to new standards of excellence Thethe periodical by and for the women of the Church�and when Relief Society women unite behind any movement, "success is insured. M. CS. Isabel B. Callister Resigns from General Board T is with keen regret that the General Presidency of Relief Society announces the resignation of Isabel Barton Callister from the General Board as of August 6, 1947. Sister Callister has been a member of the General Board only one year and three months, but during that time she demonstrated her great ability and fitness for General Board work as well as her deep love and interest in Relief Society. During her service as a Board Member her contribution to the Relief Society program reached throughout the Church. The resignation of Sister Callister was tendered because of her prolonged illness, since it is felt that all her energies should be used for the improvement of her health and for the care of her family. The prayers and love of the members of the General Board and Re. Lief Society members everywhere will be with Sister Callister for the full recovery of her health. husband Elder Clifford E.
