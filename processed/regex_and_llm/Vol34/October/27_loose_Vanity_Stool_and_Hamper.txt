Vanity Stool and Hamper Eva Willes Wangsgaard vanity stool and hamper combination is both decorative and useful. The process of assembling the materials, cutting the pattern, and finishing the design appeals to individual resourcefulness and creative ability. To make the round combination stool and hamper illustrated here, the following materials are needed: 1% yards of brocade or nylon taffeta upholstering material, 39 inches wide 1 _ batt, part wool (For opaque material, the reconditioned batts are cheap and resilient, but, being colored, they show through taffeta, and, for this material, a white batt is required. ) yards of unbleached muslin or two washed flour bags, large size nail keg, 13 inches in diameter plywood lid (15-inch circle) yards of quilted rayon lining yards of grosgrain ribbon. For the round hamper shown in the picture, I used a nail keg 1 inches in diameter and had the top cut off, using a power saw, leaving the keg 15% inches tall. The inside I lined with heavy wallpaper as a guarantee against slivers, and the outside was given a coat of batting, twice the thickness of the opened bat. This was held in place by tacking unbleached muslin over it, so that fitting of the upholstery would not pull the batting loose. Next, I cut strips of the unbleached muslin 17 inches wide and joined them to make a strip 42 inches long. This was the upholstery foundation and was worked flat. It was folded into sixteen equal parts (leaving an allowance for the final Page 690 seam), pressed with a hot iron, and the folds marked with a pencil, as guides. The brocade was cut next. These strips were 5 inches wider than the muslin and the two full widths of the material in length. Like the muslin, this material was folded into 16 equal parts, pressed, and marked with chalk. Then the brocade was pinned on top of the muslin, crease to crease, chalk mark to pencil mark, with 3 inches extending above, and 2 inches below the width of the muslin. These were then basted into position and sewed on the machine, running the stitching the full width of the brocade as added strength and as guides for future pleating. Strips of batting were cut 10 inches wide and 17 inches long and rolled into firm rolls. These were inserted into the loops formed between the brocade and the muslin. The lining was cut 1 inch shorter than the depth of the keg, and, since the quilted rayon ran 39 inches wide, one width was enough. Next, I cut two strips of the lining material, the full 39 inches long and 20 inches wide, and joined them into one continuous strip. This strip I folded inside out, and lengthwise, and seamed it as fora belt. When it was turned right side out, the seam was tailored back. This made a firm edge for the top of the pockets. ROUND HAMPER SERVING AS A STOOL FOR THE DRESSING TABLE Note the top of the hamper made of floral-patterned material, and the sides made of plain goods. The lining was folded into 8 equal parts, creased, and marked. LAY-OUT FOR MAKING ROUND HAMPER l. Foundation; 2. Lining for lid; 3. Hinge; 4. Upholstery; 5. Foundation padded; 6. L id, showing the under side and the lifting tab; 7. Lining, before seaming; 8. Lining for the bottom circle.
The long double strip was treated in the same manner, pinned, and basted, and sewed on the machine, crease to crease, in the same manner as were the brocade and the muslin, while it lay flat. A final seam was allowed for and joined when the process was completed, making a circular set of pockets. The pockets were 1 inch from the bottom of the lining and 3 inches from the top. The loops are of a generous size, 5 inches of lining and 10 inches of fold, and will hold a pair of slippers or a roll of knitting or crocheting. A circle of lining 13 inches in diameter was cut and joined to the pocketed lining at. the bottom after the final seam. To make a hinge, a piece of brocade was cut, interlined with firm cotton, seamed like a belt, reversed, and tailored. When finished it was 7 inches wide and 9 inches long, and was sewed to the upholstery on the sewing machine at a line directly over the padded curve at the back of the finished stool. A deep pleat in the upholstery, taken at the right side of each padded loop, fitted the brocade to the lining. Both upholstery and lining were seamed and were cylindrical in form at this stage. The lining and upholstery were joined on the machine, face to face, and care was taken to insert the down flap of the hinge in the seam. VANITY STOOL AND HAMPER Then the lining was slipped inside the keg and the upholstery was eased down over the outside. A few well placed tacks held the lining and the top of the upholstery in place while the upholstery was stretched taut and tacked to the bottom of the keg, making pleats to correspond with those at the top. A piece of cardboard the size of the bottom of the keg was tacked over the whole, hiding all raw edges. For the lid, heavy layers of batting were cut a little larger than the plywood and a circle of brocade, 18 inches in diameter, was fitted over all with care being taken to center the design. This was tacked on the reverse side. 693 Next, the hassock was laid on its side and the lid laid alongside, touching at a tangent. The hinge was nailed to the inner side of the lid. A small tab of brocade was made and attached to the lid in front to serve as a lifting handle. A circle of cardboard was cut 14 inches in diameter and one of lining material 17 inches in diameter was laid over the cardboard. A length of twine sewed in a running stitch around the lining circle and drawn tight on the reverse side of the cardboard made a lining for the lid. This was tacked over the hinge, tab, and raw edges for a neat finish. The lid was supported by grosgrain ribbon of a color to match the RECTANGULAR HAMPER Note the attractiveness of the brocade covering and the handy pockets. 694 lining, being tacked on each side to the middle of the lid and to the middle of the keg. The tacks were hidden under tailored bows. Fancy cord could be used for the same purpose. Stockings and is used regularly as a vanity stool and has served, also, as an occasional chair. The round stool holds shoes and The oblong hassock serves as an ottoman by my slip-covered chair, and holds shoes and fancy work which may be tucked away and taken out again in odd moments. In the illustration the hinges in the rectangular hassock are visible on the outside. It would be better to insert them in the seam, or still better to use pin hinges of metal. The Kidnaping (Continued from page 669 ) States all the keeds are like that. "If you will pardon me, Senora� my English, eet ees bad." She smiled apologetically, and the children still listened with rapt attention. "I tell them that thees boy ees of no great wealth." We looked at Danny's white overalls, bought in the mercado to resist the cement wash tray, and at his brown "'meeky" shoes. "T want them to know," her voice was sad now, "that such theengs as the health and speereets of thees child are possible some day to all in Mexico." Then she bowed quickly and said, "Con permiso." Before I could say a word in appreciation, she was lost in the fast moving traffic. The children, too, 'broke away and let Danny ride past them. He pedaled slowly so that I could walk by his side. "In Mexico," he told me, the slightly fatuous grin still on his face, "everyone seems to like me." DUSK ON THE BEACH Melba S. Payne I stood at dusk upon the sandy beach, And watched the foamy whitecaps rise and fall, While gray gulls dipped and brushed their wings on each, Then soared into the blue, with mating call. The sun splashed copper glints on waves that curled, While, half immersed in ocean's greenish blue, They slowly slipped into a swaying world, And changed the colors all a darker hue. And while I watched, my senses were replete With ecstasies I had not felt before. The fresh salt spray upon my face was sweet; The full-tide mark was left upon the shore. Reluctantly, I left this peaceful sight Of ocean slowly fading into night. FROM THE FIELD Margaret C.

NORTH REXBURG STAKE, NEWDALE WARD (SUGAR, IDAHO) ATTENDANCE CONTEST Anita Schwendiman reports an interesting contest recently held in her ward. "Two years ago we were very discouraged about our attendance, sometimes having as low as six or seven ladies present, mostly grandmothers. Our executive officers consist of two grandmothers and two mothers, so we challenged each other to a contest which was to finish with a good party for the winners, given by the losers. Last year the grandmothers won. It was great fun and the party they gave was lovely. This year the contest has been very close. Monday evenings and Tuesday mornings the sisters would go rushing about inviting friends and neighbors to attend the meetings. Cars were sent to bring the grandmothers to meetings. The contest ended with the mothers winning by one point. The winners were given a fine pioneer party and prizes of potted plants were presented to the oldest member, the youngest member, the mother with the best attendance record, the grandmother with the best record, the member enrolled longest in Relief Society, and others. Our average attendance has increased from ten in 1945 to twenty-six in 1947." Theology�The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 4�"Gabriel's Annunciation of John and Jesus" "The Babe of Bethlehem" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapters 7 and 8, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, January 6, 1948 Objective: To show that the coming of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ was announced by an angel sent from God; and that their births fulfilled great promises by angels and prophets. THE circumstances surrounding the birth of our Lord are hallowed by heavenly manifestations. One who believes is always inspired and lifted up by the story that "'never grows old." There was a very close relationship between the coming of Jesus, the Savior, and the birth of John the Baptist about six months before. The latter was a great prophet, whose mission was Closely identified with the beginning of the work of the Redeemer. Zacharias was a priest of the Aaronic order, who officiated in the temple. His wife Elisabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. It had been a source of deep regret to this couple that they were childless, and they were well stricken in years. On an important day to the Jews, it had fallen to the lot of Zacharias to officiate during one of the most sacred ceremonies of the temple. He was separated from the Holy of Holies by the veil of the temple. At the supreme moment of his sacred Page 702 service, an angel of the Lord appeared to the astonished priest. So far as we know, this was the first appearance of a heavenly messenger to a Jew in many generations. No doubt, they had grown to believe, as most Christians now believe, that such things were of the past and did not occur. The messenger announced that he was Gabriel, an angel who stood in the presence of God; that he, Gabriel, had come to apprise Zacharias that his wife Elisabeth would bear him a son; that the child to be born would be a great blessing to the people; and that he would be great in the sight of the Lord. He was to be reared a clean young man, and guarded against the use of strong drink. (The writer asks indulgence to digress long enough to urge the sisters of the Relief Society to study the first chapter of Daniel. You will get the reason for this injunction to the parents of John the Baptist. ' It will be an excellent opportunity to emphasize the relationship between LESSON DEPARTMENT a clean body and a calling in the service of the Master. ) The promise to the priest and his aged wife seemed impossible, and he asked the angel how it could be. Because of his doubt, Zacharias was stricken dumb until the promise was fulfilled. He remained dumb until the day that John was named at the time he was circumcised, at which time, also, there was a great manifestation oft he gift and power of the Holy Ghost (Luke 1:57-80). There was no greater prophet in Israel than John the Baptist. About three months before John the Baptist was born, the angel Gabriel was sent, also, to a devout young woman living at Nazareth, in Galilee. This young woman was of the royal lineage of David, and her name was Mary. She was unmarried, but was betrothed to Joseph, who was also a descendant of David, Israel's greatly revered former king. The angel's message to Mary was, perhaps, the most beautiful that had yet fallen on women's ears: " . . . .Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art though among women� (Luke 1:28) It is reasonable to believe that all of the faithful daughters of Israel looked forward with joy to the time when the Messiah would come. They knew that some pure Jewish maiden would be his mother. Surely, no greater honor or blessing could come to a woman. The angel told Mary that she would conceive in her womb and bring forth a child and should call his name Jesus (Luke 1:30-33). That he should "be called the Son of the Highest .... and of his kingdom there shall be no end." To her inquiry as to how it could be, seeing that she was a virgin, the angel explained: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God (Luke 1:35). This humble and pure girl replied: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word . . . (Luke 1:38).  The joy that came to Mary with the knowledge that she was to be the mother of "the Only Begotten" Son of Elohim, the Eternal Father, in the flesh, was also accompanied by some natural misgivings. Mary had visited her cousin Elisabeth in Judea and had, no doubt, received strength and assurance when informed of the approaching birth of the fetter's child. The Holy Ghost prompted Elisabeth to say to Mary: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? (Luke 1:42-43). (Read also Luke 1:46-55).When Mary returned from her visit to Elisabeth "she was found with child." Joseph, a just and good man, was much troubled when: .... behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost (Matt. 1:20). Joseph's joy was great. He was of royal descent, and he knew now that there would be no shadow cast upon his family status. The angel's greeting: "Joseph thou son of David," is very significant. Joseph immediately married Mary, ".... And knew. Her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus" (Matt. 1:25). The Son of David born to Mary was, in reality, the King Emmanuel, the Redeemer of the world. The Babe of Bethlehem The prophets not only foresaw the birth of the Messiah, but they also fixed the place of his birth at Bethlehem, a small village in Judea. Both Mary and Joseph lived in Nazareth, a considerable distance from Bethlehem. We must bear in mind that the Jews were subjects of the Roman Empire, and that Herod was only a dependent king, an appointee of the Emperor. A decree had been issued by Augustus, the Roman Emperor, that all of the Jewish people must be enrolled for the purpose of taxation. In obedience to the requirements of this decree, Mary and Joseph went to Bethlehem, their city, and the city where David, their royal ancestor, spent much of his early life. No doubt, Herod arranged all the details of the census, and for the collection of the taxes. It was while on this trip that one of the earth's greatest events took place. Our Lord was born amidst humble surroundings. He was born during a "camping out" trip, but, probably, considering the customs of the day, not in such abject poverty as is sometimes pictured. Nevertheless, it is marvelous that Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten in the flesh of the LESSON DEPARTMENT Eternal Father, was cradled in a manger. Later, it was said that he descended below all things that he might rise above all things. There is nothing more beautiful and thrilling in all literature than the description found in Luke 2:8-14 of the birth of the Master. It would be well for all to memorize those verses. No wonder a heavenly choir was sent. If that same angelic choir could again sing of a time when, in reality, there would be universal peace and "good will toward _ men," it would be the sweetest music of all the ages. Well might it be said, "But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart" (Luke 2:19). Joseph and Mary, both being Jews, strictly obeyed the Jewish laws and its requirements. It was required that every mother remain in retirement for forty days. Joseph became the legal father of Jesus. In accordance with requirements, Jesus was taken to the temple by his parents and all ceremonials strictly observed. Simeon, one of the few Israelites who had remained true to God and who had been promised by the Holy Ghost that he would not die until he had seen the Christ, was in the temple when the baby Jesus was presented. By the same spirit, Simeon recognized the Child and, lifting him up, said: "Lord, now lettest thy serv- _ant depart in peace, according to thy word: For mine eyes have seen thy salvation" (Luke 2:29-30). It is but natural that rumors of all these wonderful happenings should finally reach the ears of Herod. He was disturbed. He was not a Jew. He was a bitterly hated Edomite, one of the posterity of Esau, who had 705 pretended to be converted to Judaism. Herod summoned the wise men and the scribes and chief priests to ascertain where Christ should be born. He was told that the birth would be at Bethlehem. He directed the wise men to find the Babe and, as soon as he was found, to bring word to the king, "that I may come and worship him also." 'These wise men found Mary and Joseph and immediately recognized the Royal Child. However, as soon as they had given him costly presents, they did not return to Jerusalem. "And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way" (Matt. 2:12). Joseph was directed by an angel to take the young Child into Egypt and remain there until directed by the same personage to return. He was obedient to this command and thereby escaped the terrible massacre of all children in Bethlehem "from two years old and under." All of the worthwhile events surrounding the birth of Jesus were made known to the Nephites on the Western Hemisphere. The Lord kept the faithful advised of developments. Because of our imperfect chronological records, it has been very difficult to fix the exact date of the Messiah's birth. We have good evidence that it was not December 25, but April 6 (D. & C. 20:1). Certainly, the events surrounding his birth would indicate springtime rather than winter when there were "shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their. Flocks by night." 706 Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Tell the story of the birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1). 2. What were the outstanding events- connected with the birth of Jesus Christ? No more beautiful account has ever been written than the one found in Luke 2:8-14. 3. Relate the incidents of the early life of the Savior until he went to live in Nazareth. �_Visiting Teachers' Messages�Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 4�Social Activities President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, January 6, 1948 Objective: much-heralded feature of the Church is the friendliness and sociability that exist among the people. In this respect the Church resembles a large, closely knit, united family which is held together by love, sympathy, common interests, and mutual understanding. This friendliness and brotherhood date back to the time of the organization of the Church, when the small group of Latter-day Saints rejoiced together in their new-found faith and fellowship. Other factors which have contributed to friendliness and comradeship were the trials and persecutions through which they all passed at the hands of their enemies; their long and tedious journeys across the plains with the attendant hazards; their arduous task of building a kingdom in the wilderness, a task which required not only courage, but united faith and prayers, close co-operation, and loving service. Then, there was the close communal life To recall the genuine and friendly social activities of the pioneers in order to better evaluate those of the present. Resulting from the organization of Church members into small, democratic local units�wards and branches�where the members all became acquainted with one another and worked and associated together, both inside the Church buildings and in all the activities of the neighborhood. But, most important of all in creating friendliness and brotherhood, has been the spirit of the gospel, which teaches love of God, and love of neighbor, forgiveness, and the Golden Rule, and which transforms strangers into friends. As we look in retrospect at the early pioneer communities, we find interesting, wholesome social activities, such as house-warmings in the modest, unpretentious homes, home parties, family and Church dinners, dances, often with intermission for basket or home suppers, picnics in the open, corn huskings, fruit cuttings, quilting bees, band concerts, serenading, excellent dramatic LESSON DEPARTMENT performances, carefully prepared and executed by the home dramatic clubs, celebrations on July Fourth and Twenty-fourth, with interesting programs, and unique and colorful street parades. The parades featured, among other things, traders, trappers, pioneers, Mormon Battalion boys, Indians, and historic episodes; also, they displayed interesting costumes worn by natives of foreign countries. When basket suppers were served, the gentlemen drew the' baskets by number, and then ate the supper with the ladies whose baskets they had drawn. Often, suppers were partaken of in the various homes during the dance intermission, the couples returning later to resume the dancing. The successful, early-day social 707 activities of the pioneers are not to be wondered at, as there was much and varied talent in the local communities, which were made up of people with interesting backgrounds from a number of different foreign countries, as well as from many states in the Union. In an interesting social survey of one of our Utah towns, with a population of 806, made in 1932 by Dr. Joseph A. Geddes, it was found that the people living there were de. Scended from the following nationalities: English, Danish, Irish, Scotch, Swiss, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, German, Welsh, and Swedish. Suggestions for Discussion Let some of the teachers tell of their early-day favorite recreation and pastimes, also, those of their parents before them. ��2-i-2- Work Meeting�Sewing (A Course for Optional use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 3�Altering the Pattern to Suit the Figure Type Jean Ridges Jennings For Tuesday, December 9, 1947 GINCE all patterns are drafted and cut to fit figures that are more or less ideally proportioned, it is frequently difficult for the home dressmaker to cut her dress from a commercial pattern and have the proper fit. Very few women are a5 symmetrical as the patterns from which they wish to make their clothes. It is impossible to have patterns for every figure type. They can only be made to fit an average of all figures. As few women are trained to draft their own patterns, we are faced with the problem of altering and adjusting commercial patterns to fit individual figure types. Most patterns are sold according to bust measure, so that if a woman measures 36 inches bust, she would expect to buy a 36 pattern. However, this is not always a good tule to fol. Low since, quite frequently, the bust measurement is out of line with all her other measurements. In such cases it is well to buy the pattern according to the rest of the figure, and make adjustment for the bust. A 708 woman who is overly full in the bust will have great difficulty fitting the shoulders and sleeves of her dress if she buys a pattern large enough to fit her in the bust line, when she is, generally, full of figure. The same difficulty will arise from buying a pattern to fit overly small busts. The adjustment in a pattern for hips that are out of line in size is much easier to make since there are fewer lines to be altered. After you have decided on the size of pattern that is best for you, find out where you need to make adjustments. 'To do this compare your own measurements with those on the pattern envelope and then actually try on the pattern. If there is more alteration necessary than can be made in the seams, you will need to cut your pattern and actually enlarge or decrease it in some sections. The pattern itself will give general rules for altering each main pattern section, but these are not specific for all needed changes. For instance, a woman who is short but full-figured will not need the extra underarm length allowed by cutting the full length of the blouse pattern and adding extra width all the way. She may want a short underarm and a long center front line, or a narrow shoulder and a wide front across the bust. These adjustments can all be made by cutting the pattern at the place to be altered and spreading it to add extra fullness or taking a fold in it to make it smaller. All of these alterations in the pattern must be made before cutting. They can and should be made on each and every piece of the pattern that does not fit the individual figure. Measure yourself carefully and measure the pattern. Then before cutting at all, change the pattern pieces that are wrong for you. After one pattern has been altered to properly fit your figure, it can be used as a basis or foundation on which to work in future sewing. Literature �Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 4�Epistles of the Doctrine and Covenants Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, January 20, 1948 Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the letters of the Prophet to the saints and the word of the Lord to the Prophet while a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri. THE Prophet Joseph Smith wrote many epistles during the closing years of his earthly ministry while he was in and about Missouri and Nauvoo, Illinois. His persecutions had become so great that he was constantly sought by the law. He would be taken for no just cause and forced to spend some time in prison. Here, under the most trying conditions, he sought and found his Maker. Then, in the true spirit of a prophet, he poured forth his heart in love and understanding. This was LESSON DEPARTMENT done by means of his pen. How often, either in jail or in hiding from his enemies, did he write to the saints is not exactly known. However, there are recorded for our edification and instruction many beautiful, inspired passages of his work as sections of the Doctrine and Covenants. It is to these writings that we would now address our thinking. There is something about a letter considered from a literary point of view that is different from an expression of thought delivered in person. A servant of the Lord may with fervor hold a listener as he relates a principle of the gospel. The tone of his voice, the intense look in his eye, the turn of his head, the gesture of his arm, all will add to his message� even compensate for any lack of literary excellence. Have you not sometimes been impressed by the fiery words of a speaker only to learn, later, when you read what he has said, that in print much of the force of his address has gone? It is true that in writing one must substitute form for personality. By this we mean, in part, the literary qualities about which we have been talking in these lessons. The economy of words, the choice of words, the effective use of words in sentence patterns�all must take the place of the personal power that holds a listener in platform delivery. In the main, the epistles to the saints found in the Doctrine and Covenants are prose in style. There are places where a lyric quality breaks through and the reader is made to feel the song of praise in the writer's heart. One such type of writing is to be found in the 122 section of the 709 Doctrine and Covenants, in the word of the Lord to Joseph Smith the Prophet while a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri. Here the Lord speaks to the troubled heart of the Prophet with comforting assurance, and he feels in his inner soul the earthly sorrow through which he must pass even unto death. The Lord gives solace, then, by helping him to understand that the greatest blessings come to one who endures all to the end, even as the Savior did. Note the beauty of this writing: The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee; while the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand. And thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors. And although their influence shall cast thee into trouble, and into bars and walls, thou shalt be had in honor; and but for a small moment and thy voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thine enemies than the fierce lion, because of thy righteousness; and thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever. If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea; if thou art accused with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? And if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb; and if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon 710 thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he? Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever (122). The characteristic love which the Prophet had for his friends is to be found in the 123 section of the Doctrine and Covenants. This inspired epistle was written in the same month of March and in the same year, 1839, as was section 122. The subject to which he addressed himself was the "Duty of the Saints in relation to their persecutors." He tells his followers that they must be diligent in keeping records of the names and deeds of those who have wronged them, which can be used as a witness against the evil doers. Even as he writes, there is a spirit of love for those who strike at him and his cause. He lashes out in figurative language against the sin, not the sinner, in such phrases as "the combinations of darkness," the "iron yoke," "the very handcuffs, and chains and shackles, and fetters of hell." His words would stamp out iniquity with cutting sharpness, in writing at least, since he was denied, in person, denunciation of these wrongs. He concludes: Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed (123:17). Activities and Readings for Appreciation In this lesson the class might well assume the role of a group of saints who lived in the troublesome days of Nauvoo. In such an imaginative thought, one may come close to hearing the Prophet actually speak. Such is the effect of having some good reader of the group read aloud an epistle from Joseph Smith. Use the 127 and 128 sections of the Doctrine and Covenants in this way. For example, in the following selection: As I stated to you in my letter before I left my place, that I would write to you from time to time and give you information in relation to many subjects, I now resume the subject of the baptism for the dead, as that subject seems to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest, since I have been pursued by my enemies. I wrote a few words of revelation to you concerning a recorder. | have had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify. That is, it was declared in my former letter that there should be a recorder, who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might make a record of a truth before the Lord. Now, in relation to this matter, it would be very difficult for one recorder to be present at all times, and to do all the business. To obviate this difficulty, there can be a recorder appointed in each ward of the city, who is well qualified for taking accurate minutes; and let him be very particular and precise in taking the whole proceedings, certifying in his record that he saw with his eyes, and heard with his ears, giving the date, and names, and so forth, and the history of the whole transaction; naming also some three individuals that are present, if there be any present, who can at any time when called upon certify to the same, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. Then, let there be a general recorder, to whom these other LESSON DEPARTMENT records can be handed, being attended with certificates over their own signatures, certifying that the record they have made is true. Then the general church recorder can enter the record on the general church book, with the certificates and all the attending witnesses, with his own statement that he verily believes the above statement and records to be true, from his knowledge of the general character and appointment of those men by the church. And when this is done on the general church book, the record shall be just as holy, and shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he had seen with his eyes and heard with his ears, and made a record of the same on the general Church book. You may think this order of things to be very particular; but let me tell you that it is only to answer the will of God, by conforming to the ordinance and preparation that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation of the world, for the salvation of the dead who should die without a knowledge of the gospel. And further, I want you to remember that John the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declared, as you will find recorded in Revelation 20:12�''And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works." You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works; consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the record of their works, and refer to the records which are kept on the earth. And the book which was the book of life is the record which is kept in heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with the doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation contained in the letter which I wrote to you previous to my leaving my place�that in all your recordings it may be recorded in heaven. Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is 711 granted that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be recorded in heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be judged, according to their own works, whether they themselves have attended to the ordinances in their own propria persona, or by the means of their own agents, according to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation from before the foundation of the world, according to the records which they have kept concerning their dead. It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of�a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the priesthood to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power has always been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in the name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is a faithful saying. Who can hear it? And again, for the precedent, Matthew 16:18, 19: "And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven (128:1-10). Pause long enough to gather the full meaning of the Prophet's words. Invite class discussion of the same. Note the manner in which the points of doctrine are made clear through the principles of good writing as we have come to know them. Enjoy this ever present opportunity of meeting Joseph Smith firsthand through the means of the literary epistle.  Social Science�Essentials in Home Training Lesson 3�Chastity Elder Joseph Jacobs For Tuesday, January 27, 1948 Objective: To show the necessity of living a chaste life, and to give suggestions for proper training in the home which will fortify members of the family to lead such a life. Of How Great Importance Is Chastity? Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are (I Cor, 3:16, 17). [N many other quotations the sanctity of the body is stressed. We know that to receive a mortal body is a great privilege and blessing, for without that body we cannot progress. We also know that we are to have our bodies with us throughout eternity. What then could be more important than keeping them free from pollution? It has been recognized that the lessening of religious belief and the decay of family life develop simultaneously. The strength of any civilization is in direct relation to the stability of its individual homes. And the strength of the home lies, in a great measure, in its fidelity and morality. Sodom and Gomorrah were ripened in iniquity and were destroyed by fire from heaven because of sensual wickedness. The grandeur of ancient Greece, the majesty of Rome, once the proud rulers of the world, have disappeared; and the verdict of history specifies the prevalence of sensual immorality as among the chief of the destructive agencies by which the fall of those mighty peoples was effected. Is our modern nation to bring upon itself the doom of destructive depravity? The forces of disintegration are at work throughout the land, and they operate as insidiously as does the virus of deadly contagion (JAMES E, Talmage: The Vitality of Mormonism, page 219). During the last half century, standards of sanitation and health have improved tremendously. Today, we demand that the water supply be pure, that milk be pasteurized, that foods on the market be inspected for their purity through enactment of the pure food laws. We want only the choice, the genuine, in our diet. How much more should we desire the choice, the genuine in purity of mind and body? And how much greater is the need for the prevention of "soul erosion," for the preservation of chastity. Education in purity of life has not received the attention which has been accorded many far less important matters. As Latter-day Saints, we regard marriage as fundamental to the greatest development and exaltation for man and woman. But, on the other hand, perversion or abuse pertaining to marriage is one of the most grievous sins. In the scriptures we are told that man is not without the woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord, indicating that the two comprise one whole or a unit in LESSON DEPARTMENT his sight. And in more modern scripture we read: "For behold, this is my work and my glory�to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Combining the above thoughts, we understand that our chief concern in mortality is to prove ourselves worthy to help our Heavenly Father in furthering his work so that man might be, and that man might have joy. The question may be asked, what does chastity have to do with all this? Simply this: that chastity keeps the fountain of life pure and clean so that through proper lineage children may be begotten, that the spirit children of our Father may have fit tabernacles in which to dwell when they are sent to this earth. What Are the Physical Effects of Unchastity? In The Improvement Era_ of March 1946, in an article entitled "The War We Haven't Won," by Robert Reese Dansie, we read: It has become popular with some to ridicule religion, morals, or whatever one may choose to call a plan for righteous living. They consider it an impracticable theory. They withdraw behind a screen of rationalization and say there is no retribution during this life, except by man's law, and, since God's law, according to them, is ineffective in dealing out punishment for violations, they'll take their chances with the life to come�if there is one. But such people have not considered the facts. In support of this statement let us look at but one problem in the field of health, venereal disease. From Pearl Harbor to February 7, 1944, the Germans and the 'Japanese killed 36,000 Americans. Syphilis killed 33,000 Americans at home during the same period. In those twenty-six months, 45,545 713 Americans were wounded by enemy action�but somewhere between twenty and forty times as many Americans, 'from 1,000,000 tO 2,000,000 were attacked� wounded�by venereal diseases. For every man the enemy put out of action, venereal disease put out three. Over six million people in the U. S. Have syphilis or gonorrhea. They are more prevalent than any communicable disease except the common cold. Syphilis causes over ten per cent of all blindness and insanity, ten to twelve per cent of all deaths from heart trouble. Countless thousands of broken homes, damaged lives, and heartbreaks follow in the wake of these enemies of mankind.... These diseases strike mainly at the young. Over one half of the infections are in young people under twenty-five years of age. Ek ee & No more loathsome cancer disfigures the body and soul of society today than the frightful affliction of sexual sin. It vitiates the very fountains of life and bequeaths its foul effects to the yet unborn as a legacy of death (James E. Talmage: The Vitality of Mormonism, page 217). President Joseph F. Smith said:.... The immortal spirits that come to earth to tabernacle in bodies of flesh have the right to be wellborn, through parents who are free from the contamination of sexual vice. Like many bodily diseases sexual crime drags with itself a train of other ills. As the physical effects of drunkenness entail the deterioration of tissue, and disturbance of vital functions... So does unchastity expose the soul to divers spiritual maladies, and rob it of both resistance and recuperative ability.... We hold that sexual sin is second only to the shedding of innocent blood in the category of personal crimes (PRESIDENT Joseph F. Smith: Gospel Doctrine, pp. 387, 388). There is nothing more disappointing than to see a lovely face and figure but to learn that the beauty is only skin deep�that bad habits and 714 evil practices have marred that outward form of loveliness. Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life (Proverbs 31:10-12). What Is the Single Standard of Morality? One distinctive Latter-day Saint tenet is our belief in and acceptance of what is called the single standard of morality. By single standards we mean that the same degree of purity and chastity is expected of men as of women. Men are just as accountable as women for their moral conduct and the same standard applies to both. Our boys are taught to observe the same purity of life as are our girls. What Benefits Are to Be Derived From Living a Chaste Life? The benefits are mental, physical, and spiritual�a peace of mind, a clear conscience, a sense of well-being and contentment in the knowledge that one has brought no dishonor to himself, his family, nor to any other; a personal satisfaction at having gained the power to resist the temptation of the flesh. A chaste life insures one against the physical suffering of social disease and keeps the life stream pure for the children that may follow marriage. It gives one a knowledge that he has obeyed one of the cardinal commands of God and that by so doing he will be, provided he is obedient to other commands also, heir to the highest glory in store for human beings, that of the celestial kingdom. Are not these benefits worth any price? How May We Teach Our Children to Be Strictly Virtuous in Their Lives? There are many things which will contribute to this important part of a child's education. First, the atmosphere of the home should assure children that marriage is a sacred institution, that happiness is there, and that love and consideration exist between father and mother. As the children grow up, attention should be called to the fact that mothers and sisters are protected by the men of the family. When boys are old enough, they should be taught to feel it their responsibility, along with the father's, to accompany or call for mother or sister when they are going out at night alone. Most children will ask questions relative to sex, and that is the psychological and most natural time for parents to discuss such matters with them. But if a child never asks these questions, do not assume he has never wondered about such things, but realize that more than likely he is getting the answers from someone else other than his parents. A feeling of trust and confidence should be cultivated between parents and children so that children will feel free to go to parents with questions and problems and receive sympathetic consideration. Companions have a great influence on the ideas and conduct of young people, especially during adolescence. Parents can do much to suggest or encourage certain friends and wholesome activities. There should be games available and facilities for favorite sports at home. Children and their friends should feel LESSON DEPARTMENT free and welcome to spend all the time they wish in their home and should be encouraged to do so. Special effort should be put forth by parents to provide refreshments for young people who assemble in _ the home. The little expense and work entailed will prove to be very much worthwhile. Adolescents should be instructed carefully and repeatedly regarding the grave dangers of permitting improper liberties and of being out alone with a partner until late hours. A boy should be taught to honor womanhood and to guard a woman's virtue with his life. A girl should be given to understand that the way in which a boy treats her depends upon her�that most boys will respect a girl's ideals, and that she is the stronger of the two in_ resisting temptation. Quoting from an article published sometime ago in The Reader's Digest, entitled "Does Your Daughter Think She's in Love?"': The right thing is to use your intelligence to check, before they get a good start, the emotions that might lead to trouble. Never hesitate to put a stop toa situation that is going too far. Never consent to do something against your better judgment to please an escort. You run that department as you feel it should be run. The kind of man you'll want to tie to some day for life will thank you for it. And there's nothing but heartache in getting mixed up with the other kind. President J. Reuben Clark gave some very timely advice (to girls and women) at a stake conference meeting recently. He referred to the matter of women's dress and especially to the way in which they outfit themselves at the beaches and other places of amusement.

In this way they acquire a taste for that which is best. Suggestive stories, off-color jokes, have no place in the home, and children should be instructed not to listen to them outside the home. Wholesome recreation is the best outlet for the emotions. Skating, horseback riding, dancing, swimming, tennis, baseball, or other similar sports should be encouraged and planned for. Young people should be urged _ to avail themselves of good courses on marriage and courtship, matriology, and child psychology. In our universities today young people clamor for such instruction. Long waiting lists attest the fact that they are eager to prepare themselves for the important responsibilities of life. Our religion is a great checkrein to temptation. It gives us a long-range program of life and shows us that committing certain evils retards our progression and will keep us out of the celestial kingdom. It gives us spiritual food from which we derive strength to combat the temptations of everyday life and an assurance that the price of obedience is cheap for the reward we ultimately gain.
