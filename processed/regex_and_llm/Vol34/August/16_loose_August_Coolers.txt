August Coolers Sara Mills N our family we like company. Maybe it's a heritage from pioneer days when anyone who passed the door, stranger or friend, was invited in. For such company _ and the kind I invite by penny postal card or telephone, I keep on hand a number of cooling drinks that I can quickly bring out from the refrigerator and cupboard. They are not expensive as expenses go these days  and they are decidedly delicious. The grocery shelves are full of ingredients for making punch, sugar and all, ready to pour into glasses of ice water. They do very well in a pinch, or when your children bring their neighborhood friends in for a party drink. As a foundation for homemade cooling drinks, I use lemon syrup. With a covered jar of this syrup in the back of the refrigerator, you are ready for anyone. Make this syrup by mixing the following ingredients together: LEMON SYRUP 2 cups lemon juice 1 cup sugar 4 tablespoons grated lemon peel You can combine this syrup with orange juice, pineapple juice, papaya juice (that one you must try), grape juice, or cherry juice. Do you know that the juice of those red pie cherries, picked in the back yard and bottled in your own kitchen, makes a drink that is superlative and entirely different? If you live where you can pick or buy a mango, peel it and force the pulp through a sieve. Use this pulp with water, the syrup, and orange juice. It is a drink to be remembered. The lemon syrup goes well, too, with all those pure juices and nectars on the grocer's shelves: apple juice, apricot nectar, peach, plum, and pear nectar. It is a good idea to keep a can or two of these juices chilled, ready for instant use. The flavor and sparkle of fruit drinks are improved by adding ginger ale or lime rickey. My party list includes the following drinks, made with ginger ale: 1/2  cup lemon juice 1 1/2 cups orange juice 3 cups cider 1/3 cup powdered sugar 3 cups ginger ale Mix together and add ice cubes This drink is good for winter parties, too. Don't forget that. If you care to add one cup of pineapple juice, it will improve the drink. 2 cups orange juice  1/2 cup lemon juice sugar to suit 1 pint ginger ale Mint garnish Squeeze and strain 1 cup lime juice. Sweeten and pour into glasses partially filled with ice cubes. Finish filling glasses with sparkling water or ginger ale. Page 551 552  1 1/2 cups chilled grape juice 2 cups chilled grapefruit juice Combine, and pour the mixture into glasses and fill with sparkling water, or ginger ale, if you prefer. Grapefruit juice and ginger ale together also make a pleasant drink. If you can get a fresh pineapple, here is a punch worth serving: 1 fresh pineapple 3 limes or lemons 4 oranges 2 quarts pure apple juice 1 bottle of sparkling water First, cut the pineapple into small cubes. Mix the fresh pineapple juice with the lime or lemon juice and orange juice. Sweeten and add the apple juice and bottle of sparkling water. The pineapple cubes can then be added. The combination makes any punch bowl proud. And now a grape juice drink: 4 cups grape juice 1/2 cup lime juice 1 cup orange juice 1 cup water Sugar to suit If you need a nourishing milk drink and want a new taste, you might try this one: 1 pint of Postum made with milk 1 pint vanilla ice cream Add vanilla ice cream to milk Postum and whip. Now, to quickly make something to go with the drinks! The first suggestion is good for everyone. If you haven't made it many times, I'm sure you have eaten it at the neighbors'. It's simply the familiar graham crackers pressed together with a sweet filling consisting of powdered sugar mixed with any number of things. The preferred mix, with children, anyway, contains chocolate. If] am going to use the crackers within a few hours, I add a little cream and powdered chocolate or cocoa to the sugar. For variation, I omit the chocolate and use vanilla and a drop of mint. Orange juice, with a little of the orange rind, is good, too. You may use any jelly or jam you have on the shelf. The variations are many. Pop the filled crackers, covered, into the ice box, if you have the time before serving. If you don't want to serve sweet crackers, here is a mixture, even easier to make, to go on those round, crisp crackers: Combine: 1 glass sharp, spreading cheese 1 cup chopped toasted almonds, or any other chopped nuts For another quick treat, take a small square or wedge of creamed cheese and 2 tablespoons or so of crisp, crumbled bacon and about the same amount of chopped parsley. A few drops of Worcestershire sauce and a drop of Tobasco sauce help. For easier spreading, use a little milk. For something more substantial, use whole-wheat bread and peanut butter. To the peanut butter, add some chopped green peppers and cucumbers. As one hears over the radio: "It's delicious. It's nutritious!"
