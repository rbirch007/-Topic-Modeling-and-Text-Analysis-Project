How the Magazine Fortifies the Visiting Teacher Anna B. Hart Member, Relief Society General Board [Address Delivered at Magazine Section, Relief Society General Conference, October 2, 1946.] ODAY, I want to speak about two of the greatest missionaries among the women of our Church the visiting teacher and TheI want to talk about the strength of each, and the triple strength, when these two missionaries fortify each other as they go into the homes of our women. We have always been aware of the strength of Thein fortifying the executive officers. Without it, they would not be able to function. We might speak of the value of the Magazine in fortifying the class leaders and the other officers of the Relief Society organization. In the interesting and pictorial Annual Report of Relief Society activities for the past year, we were aware that only 74,032 members out of the 101,691 members of Relief Society were subscribers to the Magazine.. It should be the aim of every visiting teacher to be a subscriber to Theand, as she keeps that guide in her hand, she should stimulate every home in her district to become a subscriber to that wonderful missionary. Much of the success of our organization depends upon the visiting teachers. They are the select ones among the membership of Relief Society; they are the sympathetic and capable teachers of the organization, the representatives of the Relief Society in the homes; they are the friends of the families of the Church; they are the bringers of special spiritual messages these teachers in Relief Society. When visiting teachers, inspired by the living example of the Great Teacher, are fortified, when they dedicate themselves anew to high ideals, let them resolve to teach better than they have ever taught before; to teach as though the whole structure of civilization rested upon their teaching. What strength and blessing could come from such a resolve of the 29,784 visiting teachers. If each teacher would say to herself, in the words of William Lyon Phelps, "I love to teach as a painter loves to paint, as a musician loves to play, as a singer loves to sing, as a strong man rejoices to run a race," she, too, would win. The visiting teacher must know that teaching is a holy calling, and that the Lord will pay her well, not in silver or gold, but in the deep satisfaction that comes to her when she has done her duty. Hers is the person-to-person teaching, as was that of the Master. She can be a Relief Society missionary and an inspiration to the homes she visits, according to her spiritual attitude and the preparation she makes. So the visiting teacher plays her instrument Page 547 548 in the great symphony of the Church. May there be no discords in her contribution. Theis carried to faraway lands. In every continent of the world, it spreads its spiritual message and interprets the urges, the longings, the spiritual needs of the women of our Church. It goes to the rich and the poor, the invalids, and those strong in body, to those who live in the shadow of the Church, and to those in remote sections of our own country. Theis a real messenger Of Relief Society. If we could see the authors who have contributed to our Magazine, we would see prophets of God, and others of our Church authorities, civic authorities, authors of note, world travelers, professors, doctors, business men, artists, poets, and many of the great women of the world. What a wealth of the world's wis-. Dom has been recorded in its pages  history, travel, philosophy, ethics, poetry, homemaking, health, skills of the hands, fiction, religion in its purest and most practical form, biography of the greatest lives ever lived, and words of Jesus. It contains a library of precious information. There is no tangible source in existence which can fortify the visiting teacher more than the Magazine. It represents Relief Society in its completeness the Magazine gives her official status. It helps the visiting teacher to feel the objectives of Relief Society; to strengthen the testimonies of the women; to strengthen Latter-day Saint homes; and to enrich the lives of women by providing opportunities for personal development. The Magazine is an important tool for the visiting teacher. It educates her, gives her ideas and skill, trains her in power to think, and the power to do. It helps her to get and to keep the spirit of the gospel. It helps her to converse on the gospel messages the principles of the gospel. It helps her to make careful and thorough preparation of messages, gems, and sermons. It helps her to understand women to cultivate more sympathy in the homes she visits; helps her to notice more beauty; appreciate more fully the healthy looking children she sees; the clean homes; the virtues of the women in the homes. It helps her to strengthen her testimony through the religious experiences and the faith-promoting accounts she reads. In this one little Magazine there are messages which could fortify a visiting teacher for a lifetime. No Relief Society member can afford not to read the organ of the organization. No visiting teacher can afford to be without the strength and preparation which the Magazine gives. The mission of the visiting teacher is to "carry on." 'To her is entrusted a glorious work, a work unique and different from that of anyone else in the entire Church. To do it well, she must emulate the Savior. We can obtain perfection only by following in his footsteps. May we appreciate the two missionaries of Relief Society more than we have ever done. May we realize the strength of their close companionship, and may we feel their influence in the homes of our Church so that the entire world will feel the influence of the Latter-day Saint homes, is my prayer.
