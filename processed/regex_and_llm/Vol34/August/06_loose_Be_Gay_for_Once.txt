Be Gay, for Once Blanche Kendall McKey IT'S a large sum, Mother," said Ann tremulously, her voice sounding thick as it pushed itself through the rigid fingers she was pressing against her lips. She and Sarah both stared at the one-hundred dollar bill Sarah had laid on the white tablecloth. For the first time since Sarah's arrival hours ago, the two women were alone. Ann's young sons had gone to the shed for the evening milking, and her daughter Ellen had left early to direct the closing program at high school. "It won't be large in a day or two, my dear," said Sarah. Suddenly the zeroes of the "100" which still held Ann's gaze ran together, and the piece of green paper became a misty blotch. "IT wouldn't take any of your money if it weren't for Ellen," she said, brokenly. "Ellen has had the brunt of everything." Sarah's gaze ran down the dim hall to a closed door. "Well, when John is about again," she began uncertainly. Ann's face was forthwith swept by a wave of eating grief, impelling her to the empty kitchen. There she poured a bowl of steaming milk, made a slice of toast, set both on a tray, and returned to the dining room. She stopped beside her mother's chair. "At this rate, the bit of money Father left you will soon be gone. It's not fair." She held the tray, steadying it with tense hands lest the milk should spill, as she walked to the hall. Page 528 Several quotations sprang to Sarah's mind, the most familiar being, "He that cometh to me shall never hunger." But she spoke none of them. She heard Ann's step falter, knowing that her daughter was pulling her lips into the semblance of a smile before entering John's room, and she let her enter, uncomforted. But what one who loved her would have noticed now was her unaccustomed expression of perplexity. In the ensuing silence, Sarah's mind seeped backward through nearly four decades and she again sat at a rough-hewn table in her kitchen at home with her husband opposite and their two children between. The land was theirs, and theirs was the stout adobe house. God was the good Provider, and she was Sarah, his handmaiden, secure in his love. The kerosene lamp glowed and the burning logs gleamed through chinks of the small cookstove. She had accepted privation, sickness, and death, but never fear. And now she felt a weakness within. Did even the spirit crumble with age?  ANN had turned on the radio in her husband's room, and  soft strains of music now floated to Sarah, who still sat motionless. She was seeing again her son's face as he had waited with her early that morning to put her on the bus. "Let Maude and me rent your farm, Mom," he had said. BE GAY, FOR ONCE "I can run yours and mine together. Your land is still good it just hasn't been worked right. And you've got to plant trees, not keep on cutting. What did Dad send me to college for, if I have to stand by and watch you go on in the same old blundering way?" Sarah loved energetic Maude and her three perky little girls, but she had felt dismayed at the thought of turning the care of her chickens and all her other small chores over to Maude. "Did you draw out the money for Ann?" she had asked, evasively. He had given her the hundred dollar bill. "How much is left, Donny?" "Right hundred." Even to Sarah this had seemed a small sum. Then he had laid a fifty dollar bill in her hand. "You need your money yourself, Donny." "I know, but you need some fun. While you are up visiting Ann, buy yourself some new togs. Be gay, for once," he had whispered. "I's hard to be gay when everything is so different," she had argued weakly. "But surely there is something you would like to have, or do?" "Yes, I have always wanted to go to the pioneer ball in a fancy dress with my hair puffed. I'm tired of Mother's stripe, if she did push it across the plains." "That's the idea,' Don had agreed, "you and Ann could whip up something pretty in no time." Now, bowed over Ann's table, his vibrant words with their tender connotation came back cuttingly. It was a pity she had missed so many of the little things women cherish. She could see Don's bill tucked in a corner of her purse upstairs. But affairs were worse with Ann than she had dreamed. "Be gay, for once," she said with trembling lips, and rising shakily, began to carry out the supper dishes. ANN returned to the kitchen. The boys came in with their clattering pails. They played for a while before they climbed upstairs for the night. About ten the side door opened softly and Ellen slipped in. Her fair skin was colorless and her dark eyes looked unnaturally large. "Has it turned chilly, Ellen?" Ann asked, concerned. "T don't think so," said Ellen. "I hadn't noticed." "How did the program go?" "Beautifully. There were a lot of 'soodbyes' afterwards, so I left " early." She has walked home alone, thought Ann. "I�m dreadfully tired now it's all over. I think I'll go to bed without disturbing Father. For goodness' sake, Mother, put away that ironing. It's lovely to have you here, Grandma. Goodnight." She walked up the stairs slowly, and Ann remembered days when her feet seemed to fly. Sarah stopped knitting. "What's the matter with Ellen?" she whispered after a pause. "Everything in general. Boy friend in particular, I fear," Ann replied. "Who is he?" "Young principal at high school." "Worthwhile?" "Very much so. Every teacher likes him. I hope nothing has happened." Late in the night Sarah heard 530 someone weeping. At first she thought it was Ann; but listening, fully awake, she knew that the torrent gushed not from a tragically resigned heart, but from youth's rebellious depths. When the storm had subsided, she felt her way to Ellen's door and knocked. "That you, Mother?" came a low, startled voice. "No, it's me," whispered Sarah. "Don't bother to make a light. May I come in for a minute?" Sarah found that it took more than a moment to draw out the story that all through David's college years and during last winter as a teacher, he had saved every penny he could for his higher degrees, and that now he was going to summer school in California and wanted to marry Ellen and take her along with him. "That would be wonderful," said Sarah.. "Grandma, it isn't possible. Do you think I could leave Mother with the garden and the orchard and Father and no money? I'm going to get a summer job." "Won't David wait?" "Of course he'll wait. But I haven't any right to hold him." She sat up, a dim, vehement wraith. "I'll be tied to this house and a dull country school until I'm a confirmed old maid." "Your brothers will grow up, you know." "They are a long way from that now." "There's your Uncle Donny." "With a wife who'll keep his nose to the grindstone as long as he lives! David has been offered a contract to teach next year in a junior college and is going to Ogden to sign and to speak at a banquet. Then he will go to the gymnasium for the annual pioneer ball." "Oh," murmured Sarah, "the pioneer ball!" "David wanted Mother and me to ride with him to Ogden he will have to stay overnight, you know. His invitation includes a partner  I could have heard his speech " As Sarah listened to the convulsive sob Ellen tried to smother, she felt a tightening within herself. Her mind began to shake off its daze of uncertainty. Amid the perplexities that had rushed into her life, here was a situation that she could do something about. "I don't think it's all so hopeless as you picture," she said. "I'm beaten flat," replied Ellen. "Even with you here, Mother couldn't leave Father. I haven't a respectable traveling suit or a presentable formal." Her voice sank to a whisper. "I've told David that I can't marry him. That I can't even go to Ogden." She sat up, rigid. "Grandma, I don't want you to think that I haven't any backbone. I'm willing to work for Dad and Mom. And I could give up David  and build some kind of life, ] suppose. But it's killing me, what I'm doing to David. His mother died when he was little, and I think he never quite got over it. He needs someone behind him " "When can I meet this David?" asked Sarah. "Never, I guess. I've sent him away for good. Oh, Grandma, nobody knows just how I feel about David!" Sarah went back to bed and lay thinking of her own youthful mar- BE GAY, FOR ONCE riage and of the good years and the lean. Before the breakfast dishes were cleared away next morning, David appeared. Sarah took him into the garden while Ellen "prettied up." As they chatted, she noted his keenly intelligent eyes, sensitive mouth, and the reserve that surrounded his spirit like a mist. An idealist, she thought, too timid before others, and felt proud of Ellen's discernment. "T have no desire to push myself where I am not wanted, Mrs. Brockton," said David stiffly. "But on the other hand, I am not going to allow a streak of bad luck to snatch Ellen from me. At least not for long." Sarah's hesitation began to recede in a wave of admiration. "Would you take me to Ogden instead of Ellen's mother?" "Of course." "Then I think you can count on Ellen, in spite of what she may say this morning." ee eK K A! First, Sarah scarcely moved as she sat in the restful chair Ellen and David had found for her before they left for the banquet. The gleaming dance floor, the faint strains of an orchestra practicing in some distant room, the elaborate costumes of a group of teen-agers going through the Sir Roger de Coverley, made her feel plaintively out of her element. The lace collar Ann had made for her with loving fingers and the cameo brooch she had borrowed, now relinquished all feeble claims to glamour. She drew her long, black coat tightly around her. Yet she was glad she had come. She had always wanted to see a pioneer ball in a "city," and here she 531 was! Ellen had looked like a tea rose in the pink dress the three of them had feverishly made. Donny, thought Sarah, I am so glad we can be gay! The old janitor in whose care David had left her came and stood before her. "May I hang your coat, Mrs. Brockton?" As she handed it to him with a smile, she noticed that he was studying her costume. "Do you dance?" he asked. "The old ones." "I�ll have to find you a partner," he said heartily, appraising the striped ruffles, old-fashioned scuffed shoes, and her inward-looking gray eyes. "You might win a blue ribbon." Interpreting her startled, inquiring gaze as a remonstrance, he began justifying himself. "My dear lady, I have watched these balls for twenty years." He returned shortly with a tall, white-haired man whose solemn features harmonized with the Prince Albert he wore. "Mrs. Brockton, this is Mr. Ludlow James." Mr. James sat down beside Sarah and began to unburden his unhappy mind. He had recently lost his wife and felt unanchored and out of place in his daughter's lively home. "Nothing seems right any more," he said mournfully. "No person and no country acts as though it knows where it's going." Sarah thought of the long roll of years, swallowing up, surging forward, coming out to some kind of fulfillment in the end. "IT guess you and I are too old to 532 change," she answered sympathetically. People began arriving, young girls and boys in formal modern dress, and handsome ladies in fluted satin and lace, looking like pictures Sarah had admired for years in the Sunday newspaper society section. A few came dressed much like Sarah herself, pushing a handcart, which they placed at the end of the hall where great bunches of sagebrush were arranged. Mr. James and Sarah had finished dancing a plain quadrille when the orchestra struck up a Strauss waltz. He rose hopefully to offer his arm, but seeing the couples whirl onto the floor, he resumed his seat. "They have no idea of this dance," he said authoritatively, "neither the technique nor the spirit of it. I used to circle a whole ballroom with a glass of water on my head." Sarah laughed happily. "My husband used to try, but he always spilled it." "Yet you dance smoothly." "My own people are natural dancers." She ran her hand lovingly over one of the ruffles. "My mother came from Kerry Gow." Ellen and David arrived in time to see the varsovienne, "David has a grand contract," whispered Ellen, her eyes glowing, as Mr. James led Sarah onto the floor. Only the older people responded, so there was no crowding. Mr. James was stately. Sarah, sunbonnet hanging over her arm, was lost in the rhythm and was reliving happier days. "Have you seen my, have you seen my, have you seen my new shoes?" she sang' inwardly. At the close, Ellen and David rushed to her. "You were wonderful," they cried. A young man touched David's elbow and, after a whispered word or two, led him and Ellen toward the door. In a moment they were lost in the crowd. An accordion began playing "Come, Come, Ye Saints," and Mr. James took Sarah to a spot from which they could watch the pantomime. There was nothing new in the pitiful trek around the ballroom floor. Lights had been dimmed except for one yellow spot at the end of the hall. Heavy boots creaked as the handcart rumbled above the accordion strains of "Come, Come, Ye Saints." A tush of tears to Sarah's eyes blotted out the entire scene. As she dried them, she saw that Ellen and David were beside her. They, too, had been deeply moved, but Sarah perceived at once that, in addition, they were the bearers of news. "Grandma," whispered Ellen, "I can teach third grade here in Ogden next winter if I like at a better salary" Here with David?" "Vien" She felt their taut nerves and read their serious faces. "Well," she said, "I've decided to rent my farm to Don so that I can live with Ann. She needs me." Involuntarily, they exchanged a glance of tenderness, then gazed at her solemnly. "I don't know, "Poor Father " "Anyway," said David thoughtfully, "Ellen and I together can help better than Ellen can alone." Absorbed in their own drama, they were not aware of what was happening until they heard Sarah's name being spoken from the platform. The mayor was leaning forward, extending an envelope. "What has happened to Mrs. Sarah Brockton?" he called.. Mr. James was pushing his way through the congested groups. "You've won first prize, Mrs. Brockton," he said happily. "The best sustained character." "What is the prize?" cried Ellen. "Twenty-five dollars, my dear." Sarah felt faint and for a moment her senses swam. Then David guided her to the platform. In beruffled dress, her bonnet fallen to the nape of her neck, revealing her smooth, white hair, a wisp or two dislocated by the bonnet's fall as though a gust of wind had just swept her, she stood silent, the embodiment of a day gone forever. Even the boys and girls stopped talking. But it was not her costume that held them, it was her lighted face. "Thank you very much," she said, at length. 533 Her thought-filled eyes swept the room, and she realized that more was expected of her. "Seeing this building and hearing this music," she said, "it's hard for me to believe that so many changes could take place within a person's memory." 'Then she added slowly, her eyes straight ahead, "But some few things never change." The colored scene faded. She was sensing the eternal relationship between God and his children. He that cometh to me shall never hunger . The mayor himself led her to the chair Ellen was reserving for her. "You didn't thank him, Grandma," the girl reminded her in surprise. Then, noticing Sarah's detachment, she realized with some dismay the gap of years that yawned bridgeless between them, silencing her own speech. But she felt one with her in spirit as she slipped her soft hand into the bony little claw that lay passive on the striped billows of the faded skirt.
