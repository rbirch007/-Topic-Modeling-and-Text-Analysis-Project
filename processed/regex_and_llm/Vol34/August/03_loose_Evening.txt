evening and sit up with the sick and at Christmas time we would see that each family had something special for their holiday cheer. When the people made grain donations and contributions of like nature, the teachers would have to gather them by team and wagon. At a later period most of the contributions consisted of money. In the colonizing of the various valleys of the Far West, small settlements were established, but still there were isolated families to be visited. In the early period of colonization wagons were used to take the sisters on their visits. Many times this would necessitate the removal of the team for the entire day from the planting and harvesting. As noontime approached, these women would be asked to dinner in one of the homes. NE elderly sister, who is now nearing her ninetieth birthday, lived during her early married life in a farming community of scattered homes. On four different occasions as she and her companion went in a wagon to do their visiting teaching, she was called upon to assist at the birth of a baby. The words of Lucy Smith, the mother of the Prophet Joseph, at the second meeting of the Relief Society, could not have been more literally lived: "We must cherish one another, comfort one another, and watch over one another." As time went on and people became more prosperous, the wagons used for visiting teaching were re placed by buggies. Two teachers who used a one-horse, light buggy to travel over their district in a scattered vicinity took with them their nursing babies, whom they carried with them into the homes. At one home they visited they decided the WHERE THERE'S A WILL next home would be reached quicker by walking through the fields. As both of their babies were fast asleep they asked young Mrs. M   -, who also had a sleeping baby, if she would mind if they left their babies there with her while they made their next visit. This was agreed upon and the teachers started out. However, they had not gone far before they heard Mrs. M calling in a loud voice, "Come quickly, all three babies are awake!" Wintertime brought hazards to those who traveled long distances to visit. Many times the teachers would start out in good weather only to find themselves in a sudden severe snowstorm far from home. Although they sometimes suffered from the extreme cold and many times arrived home hours late, still they were protected and none lost her life. In midwinter, when the snow was heavy Photograph, Courtesy Muriel S. Wallis 509 on the ground, they hitched their teams to bobsleighs and thus covered their districts. In one community a team of mules was often used on a wagon in good weather and on a sleigh in the winter. In many communities the women went horseback to do their teaching. A woman now in her eighties relates that she and a companion, both at the age of nineteen, were chosen to be teachers in a little Latter-day Saint settlement. They rode horseback to do their teaching in the ward, comprising twelve families who lived up and down a creek for a distance of five miles. Women still travel by horseback. In one of the northern states, where the snow lies some sixty inches deep in the winter, a mother and her daughter, during the bad weather, travel in this manner because they can cover more territory in less time.

Visiting teaching, in such cases, is done by bus, by street car, and by subway, thus requiring a tremendous amount of time to be spent between visits. However, a group in one mission field found that the visiting teachers were not able to walk the distances and so a motor Corps of eighteen women was organized, composed of women with cars who could drive. These sisters called for the visiting teachers and drove them to the homes in their districts. In 1931, this group visited from two hundred thirty-five to two hundred sixty-five families each month, and traveled monthly four hundred miles. The second World War necessarily brought some curtailment to visiting teaching in many parts of the world. The visiting teachers in one European country, where they had used bicycles to get to the homes, found that they could not purchase new tires. 'This did not deter them, however, for during the war they used their bicycles without tires and rode on the rims to visit the families. In the United States, however, it was not unusual to find the visiting teachers pooling their supply of gasoline to covet the miles which intervened between families. Not only have hundreds of thousands of women served in the capacity of a visiting teacher, but they have probably served as long, or in many cases, longer, than those in other of offices within the organization. At a recent stake party, a tribute was paid the women who had the longest visiting teaching service records. Seven women, representing the seven wards in the stake, had served the following numbers of years: sixty-seven, thirty-five, forty, forty-six, forty-four, twenty, and thirty-five. But the tale is not told in its entirety by the length of the service. Truly, we may Say with Emerson, "The only gift is a portion of thyself." 'This the visiting teachers give through their spirits which have warmed, comforted, and blessed those whom they have visited. Their hands have been ready to help, and their hearts have led them into the ways of most helpfulness. As a present-day teacher has expressed it: "I just go and help break the measles out, when it's necessary." Because they have been willing to exchange the push of circumstances for the pull of a strong worthwhile purpose, the visiting teachers have learned the love of sisterhood, and have been a tremendous force in welding together the individual members of Relief Society into a united whole, and with a consequent building of the kingdom. Indeed, we might say each teacher would concur with the words of Lord Shaftsbury: During a long life I have found that not one kind word ever spoken, not one kind deed ever done, but sooner or later returns to bless the giver and becomes a chain binding men with golden bands to the throne of God.

Cummings Former President, Highland Stake Relief Society Ethel Colton Smith was named a member of the General Board, July 2, 1947. In calling her to this position, the General Presidency of Relief Society has recognized a worker who possesses an unusual combination of characteristics which qualify her well and which will enable her to render valuable service to the women of the Church. She has a keen mind and is efficient and direct in her approach to anything she undertakes. She is painstaking and makes a work of art out of whatever she does be it sewing a patch on a small boy's overall, wrapping a Christmas package, preparing a meal, or a project of greater proportions and importance. With all her efficiency and artistry, she ls, above all, a lover of her fellow men. Some of us are religious in heart; she is religious in deed. She is generous, tolerant, and sympathetic, and the rendering of concrete service to neighbors, friends, and family has occupied her life. The virtues of this new General Board member have had steady growth and nurture throughout her life. When she was ten years of age her mother died and she, her sister, and her brother went to live with their grandparents, Sterling Driggs Colton and Nancy Wilkins Colton. Their father died two years later and they remained in the home of these good people who brought them up Page 514 and Colton Smith was ETHEL COLTON SMITH as their own children. Ethel assumed a large part of the responsibility for her younger sister's care. It is remembered in the family how she taught this little sister to care for her clothes, to be neat and clean; and how she worked and planned and sacrificed to give her opportunities. From her stalwart and honest grandfather, Ethel learned the value of time and the importance of being prompt and dependable. Her grand- ETHEL COLTON SMITH mother was a Relief Society stake president in Uintah Stake for many years and was beloved by all who knew her for her administrations to the sick, for her comforting and encouraging words in time of trouble, and for her generosity in time of need. Early in her life Ethel saw compassionate service, which is a vital part of the Relief Society plan, rendered in its fullest measure, and learned of the joy that comes from self-sacrifice in service to others. She has a deep love for Relief Society and is a firm believer in its divine origin and purpose. Sister Smith was born in Whiterocks, Uintah County, Utah. Her parents were Sterling LeRoy Colton and Lula Camp Colton. She received her education in the public schools and the Uintah Academy at Vernal, Utah, and at the Latter-day Saints College, Salt Lake City. She was married in the Salt Lake Temple to Elwin F. Smith, who is the appraiser for Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company. They have a nine-year-old son, Robert Colton Smith. Sister Smith is an experienced business secretary and has been an active worker in the P. T. A. And the Red Cross organizations. She has always been active in the Church, 515 having taught in Primary, Sunday School, and M. I. A. Organizations. For five and a half years she was a member of the Highland Stake Relief Society board, acting as secretary-treasurer for four and a half years of that time. Working closely with Ethel during those years, I learned to know her well and to appreciate her ability. Her spirit of enthusiasm and co-operation made it a joy to work with her; and to give her an assignment was to know that it would be completed promptly and well, with every detail carefully worked out. Her knowledge of the fundamental rules and policies of the Relief Society organization, and her helpful suggestions for putting them into practice were invaluable in carrying out the program in Highland Stake. She has rendered efficient, effective service to the Society and to the women with whom she worked and associated. They wish her joy and success in her new assignment. In this calling she will continue to serve well. Whatever she is given to do she will do with purpose and directness, tempered with humility, wisdom, and good judgment. And, permeating all her efforts, will be a spirit of tolerance, love, and compassion for her fellow men. ERRATUM Attention is called to a mistake in the July 1947 issue of Thepage 351, in which the name of Sister David O. McKay is given as Jennette Evans McKay. This is the name of Brother McKay's mother. Sister David O. McKay's name is Emma Rae Riggs McKay.
