REMEMBRANCE Erma Young Gardiner May our hearts stir in remembrance, Our minds be brought to comprehend, How God walked beside our fathers, Until they reached the promised land. May we ever shout his glory Until the air is filled with praise, For he meted out his sustenance Equal to their weary days. May we never cease to marvel That the sea gulls filled the air, And flocked to save the wheat in answer To a people's humble prayer. May our hearts swell to remember That a desert's barren soil Yielded grain and fragrant beauty To reward their faith and toil!
