PATTERNED BY THE FURROW Eva Willes Wangsgaard Here lies my heart, as storm-swept as a furrow - Emerging from its baptism of snow, Cleansed of all evil by the icy harrow, Whose brittle teeth prepare for wheat to grow. Though furrows never know the heart's numb aching, However deep the drift or sharp the wind, Nor sense the joy of herds released for flocking Back to the hills where feed is spread unbinned; Yet, there is hope in furrows warm and teeming With life up reaching for the ungrown sheaf, As there is faith, wherever ewes are lambing, And promises in petal, blade, and leaf. So, let my heart be patterned by the furrow, Cleansed by world storm, expectant for tomorrow. The Value of Relief Society Membership (Continued from page 154) We are aware of problems facing a mother with young children (I have three of my own under nine years of age, so I feel that I speak with some degree of first-hand knowledge about the matter) and say to them, become an enrolled member and, even though you may not be able to attend all the meetings, come when you can, and participate in the part of the program you feel will be most beneficial to you. We know that you will be well repaid. This morning, as I listened to Sister Spafford report the past year's work in the officers' meeting, a feeling of pride welled up within me, as I listened to the accomplishments of Relief Society. The information was not new to me, as I practically memorized the annual report when preparing for fall conventions, but that proud feeling comes to me every time I realize that I am one of that great group of women whose united efforts bring forth such wonderful and worthwhile results. I desire to thank the Lord for my membership in Relief Society, and I bear testimony that it has been a great and good influence upon my life. May the Lord, in his wisdom, goodness, and mercy, bless us all as mothers and women of his Church, and I ask this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Note: Three of the conference addresses were published in the December 1946, Magazine, and several others appeared in January 1947. The two remaining addresses will be published later in 1947.
