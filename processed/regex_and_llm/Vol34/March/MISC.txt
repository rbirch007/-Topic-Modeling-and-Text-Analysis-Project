THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 34, NO. 3; MARCH 1947 BEACONS Margery S. Stewart This is not mine, to walk rough wagonways, To shield the dying from the rain, or blaze Of prairie sun; to portion meal, To take a doctor's role, and heal The sick, or hold a babe, newborn; _ To push a handcart so a wife might mourn The loss of husband. This was theirs; They met the challenge with their toil and prayers. But this is mine, they passed it down to me, The urge that will not rest until I see That children everywhere are warm and fed; That I mourn with my sister for her dead. My fingers have no peace because I know That half a world goes ragged in the snow And bitter cold. All this is mine, Because their lights before me ever shine.

BELL ON THE OLD RELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING BLANDING, UTAH Photograph by Willard Luce Compassionate Service�The Fundamental Work of Relief Society President Belle S. Spafford [Address Delivered at Relief Society General Conference, October 3, 1946] DURING the month of May, I had the privilege of visiting the historic city of Nauvoo, in company with Sister Edith Smith Elliott and a group of her relatives, who are also relatives of the Prophet Joseph Smith. We stood on the site where once was the Joseph Smith store�a spot made sacred through being the birthplace of Relief Society. A few rods below us was the mighty Mississippi River, so placid at this point one wondered if it really were flowing. It was a quiet spring day. The assembled group stood silently reverent, each recalling events of that day over 100 years ago when another group had assembled there, eighteen women. Standing upon the threshold of a new day, listening to words that have glowed with greater light each succeeding year, words of a Prophet of God when he declared this Society organized according to parliamentary usages, saying that all who should thereafter be admitted should be "free from censure and received by vote." I wondered if any of those present, with the possible exception of the Prophet, thought that day how far the work might spread. I thought of the tens of thousands who had affiliated with this Society during its 104 years of life; I thought of the more than 100,000 who now make up its membership�women from the cities and farms of every state in Our own great nation, women in the little branch organizations of faraway Tonga or South Africa, women from Old Mexico and stricken Europe, women largely "free from censure," welded together in a great bond of sisterhood for service to those in distress, and for personal growth. That others were similarly thinking was evidenced when one woman. Not a member of our Church, but one who was entirely familiar with its early history, being a direct descendant of one of the Prophet's sisters, asked: "Mrs. Spafford, how did you ever get to be national?" I knew what she meant. She wondered what was the genius of this Society; what was there within it that could cause this Society, so humble and unostentatious in origin, to attract and hold the interest of women for more than a century. Enlisting them from varied walks of life and many nations, causing it to grow and expand until it could claim its present-day mighty following. Her question bears analysis. Page 147 148 Relief Society is great because of the greatness of its birth. Under divine inspiration, a Prophet of God, one chosen to be the instrument through which the gospel was to be restored to earth, gave to latter-day women this Society, and he personally taught them correct procedures and what their several activities would embrace. 'Throughout its history, the Society has been guided, directed, and protected by the influence of that sacred power given to men holding the Holy Priesthood. It has been blessed in both the local and general organizations with the leadership of women of vision, faith, courage, understanding, and diligence. Its membership has been made up of devoted, self-sacrificing, hard-working women, rendering free-will service because of an inner conviction of the truth of the gospel and the importance of caring for the children of our Father and of contributing to the Master's work. A great underlying spirit has motivated all of its activities, the spirit of the gospel. This is the unifying, compelling force that has carried it ever onward and upward. The work of Relief Society is soul enriching. It calls for self-sacrifice, but it offers � self - fulfillment. Through its program, Latter-day Saint women have experienced a century of self-development and self-refinement. The Prophet turned the key that knowledge and intelligence should flow down from that time henceforth. Whatever a woman's talents may be, Relief Society offers opportunity for her development. Since the turn of the century, a formal educational program has been carried forward where "subjects that tend toward RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�MARCH 1947 the elevation and advancement of women in many lines of thought and action" have been taught. Through the educational opportunities of the Society, thousands of women have become more adept in homemaking, and have been better able to intelligently participate in the civic and social life of their respective communities. Withal, they have maintained a spiritual equilibrium. This educational activity is in keeping with instructions of our Heavenly Father:. Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith (Doc. And Cov. 88:118). It is in harmony with God's law of eternal progression: Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come (Doc. And Cov. 130:18-19). So Relief Society goes steadily forward, educating its members, helping them toward full self-realization. HE most exalted function of the Society, however, is that in which its members lose sight of personal gains in unselfish devotion to others. The relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow and the orphan; ministrations to the sick and downtrodden; comfort to the sorrowing and those whose souls are weary; the exercise of benevolence� this is the great and fundamental work of Relief Society. COMPASSIONATE SERVICE Time and again, the Prophet Joseph Smith made this clear in his instructions to the sisters in Nauvoo. At the first meeting of the Society, he addressed the sisters: To illustrate the object of the Society, that the society of the sisters might provoke the brethren to good works in looking to the wants of the poor, searching after objects of charity and in administering to their wants. At the fifth meeting of the Society, he said: This is the beginning of better days to the poor and needy who shall be made to rejoice and pour forth blessings on your heads. The Prophet told the sisters that if they would have God have mercy on them they should have mercy on one another. He gave the sisters this important instruction: "Said Jesus, 'Ye shall do the works ye see me do.' These are the grand key words for the Society to act upon." The works of the Master were works of love and compassion. Compassionate service is according to the nature of woman. The Prophet recognized this, for, in organizing this work, he said, "... It is natural for females to have feelings of charity and benevolence." Love of woman for her sister, love of woman for humanity, love of woman for that which is pure, ideal, and sacred is God-implanted in her heart. This love is the most potential service-power known to human society. Relief Society has been rich in this service-power, as its works bear testimony. Love-inspired service is the thing for which Relief Society is best known and most highly respected. 149 One caution I would offer Relief Society women today, however. We must be alert to preserve, strong and active within this Socicty, this precious, vital clement, lest modern trends and influences dull it or retard its expression. I wonder if we are doing this, or if the recent tendency of Relief Society has not been to emphasize our educational activities, and to be less attentive to our compassionate services. Then, too, I wonder if we have not been somewhat influenced by the trend of the times which has been toward professional service in meeting human needs. Conditions today seem to warrant a re-emphasis of compassionate service as the fundamental work of Relief Society. Evil forces are stalking the earth, spreading sorrow and distress. There is an ominous murmur of additional trials and sorrows ahead. Advanced as we are in many fields, today's world is not free from distress and suffering. There are still sorrowing hearts that need to be comforted; there are still the discouraged and weary who need to be given new heart; there are still those who are ill needing a few hours of practical nursing, for whom no nurses are available; there are still motherless homes needing the softening touch and capable hand of a good woman; there are still homebound persons among us who, through a friendly visit, need to be brought into contact with the current of life; there are still the aged with their manifold infirmities and problems calling for attention. Relief Socicty women, awake to their duties and working under the direction of men holding the Holy Priesthood, can be effective in alleviating 150 these distresses among our people. Relief Society women today must guard their trusts carefully. They must not let the hours and days slip by, unmindful of time's swift passing until their day shall be done, insensitive to the needs and the opportunities about them, unheeding the dangers lurking ahead. But, walking in the paths marked out for them by our latter-day prophets, holding fast to gospel truths, strengthened and reinforced by the knowledge and intelligence gained through the RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�MARCH 1947 educational opportunities of the Society, they must advance the fundamental purposes for which this Society was established. In this trying, chaotic day, may our Latter-day Saint mothers unite as one and, clothed with the armor of faith, may we pray that the hand of evil will be stayed, and the hearts of men and nations -will turn unto the ways of the righteous, that suffering, fear, sorrow, and hatred will loose their hold upon the earth. And I pray this, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
