MIRACLE OF SPRING Gene Romolo The spirit of light, from the crest of a mountain Spreads a gold gossamer over the hills, And lifeblood of bloom, like the flow of a fountain, From the earth's great heart its beneficence spills, Till limbs, winter-shrunken, grow supple and green, And greener the blades of each grass-growing plot.. However somber the time in between, Spring has each year its miracle wrought.
