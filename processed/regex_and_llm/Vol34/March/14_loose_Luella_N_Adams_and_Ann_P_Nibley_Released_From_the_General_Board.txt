Luella N. Adams and Ann P. Nibley Released From the General Board of Relief Society T is with sincere regret that the '| General Board of Relief Society announces the resignations of Luella N. Adams and Ann P. Nibley in January 1947. Due to increased home responsibilities, these faithful sisters have found it necessary to be released from their work as Board members.: Sister Luella N. Adams has been a member of the Board since January 1940. She has served with the utmost devotion. Her many fine abilities and unusually good judgment, coupled with her long experience in Relief Society work, have made her assistance to the women of the Church a service of lasting value. Sister Adams is greatly loved by all the members of the Board and by Relief Society women everywhere. As a group of sisters, the Society wishes her happiness in all her future endeavors. Sister Ann P. Nibley was called to the General Board in December 1941. Her charming personality and her sweet spirit have endeared her to the women of the Church. She has worked for perfection in all her assignments, and her meticulous regard for the details of Relief Society work has been of invaluable assistance to her associates and to the Society. Sister Nibley will always merit the love and appreciation of Relief Society women everywhere. ~ > oe THIS IS SPRING Evelyn Fijeldsted A radiant sunset soon to be the dawn That lights a waiting, crocus-sprinkled lawn; Illusive, lilting winds and bending tree; A blossom sheltering a night-chilled bee, Robins drifting over furrowed land, Tiny swirls of century-driven sand; The living, throbbing warmth of noontide glow, A budding plum tree drinking melting snow; Sunlight, glinting through a breathless calm, The blending of a secret, perfumed balm; A stormy measure gone, and hope renewed, The stillness of a starry interlude; Each day's unceasing versatility, The night's capricious, feigned uncertainty, All the subtle sweetness earth can bring, This is restoration�this is spring. Page 183 Notes TO THE FIELD Time for Holding Optional Sewing Class THE General Board recommends that, wherever possible, the optional sewing course be held in connection �with the regular work meeting. Where it is not possible, however, to successfully work on the Welfare sewing and also conduct a sewing course during the work meeting, the sewing class may be held at the time most convenient for those who wish to participate in this course. These Relief Society sewing classes may be held once a week if the ward Relief Society presidency deems it advisable.: If the sewing class is held in connection with the regular work meeting, the Relief Society members attending the class should be given credit for being present at the work meeting. Non-members of Relief Society who attend the sewing class should be recorded as visitors. In as much as the record of sewing activities was devised to reflect the sewing services rendered by Relief Society members to others, or for the benefit of the organization itself, articles made at the sewing class, and the number of hours required to make them should not be counted nor recorded in the record book, if these articles were made for the benefit of the individuals taking the sewing course. If the class is held at a time other than the regular work meeting, it should be regarded as a special Relief Society project, and an account of the activities, number of women participating, and any other interesting information connected with the conduct of this class should be recorded in the narrative report only. Such a class, held at a time other than during the regular work meeting, is not a part of the work meeting, nor is it a special meeting.

Its importance is seen on every hand. Without its presence, eminent success is impossible. Every great achievement is predicated upon its guidance. This is verified in the lives and works of all great persons, and in all epochs of history. In its widest sense, good leadership implies all factors that tend toward maximum results in visioning, planning, promoting, unfolding, guiding, directing, and building.
The fact that leadership involves these several factors promptly suggests that to become efficient in its exercise one must necessarily become schooled and disciplined in many branches of study. Among these, the following should claim our immediate attention: personality, tact, organizing ability, humor, and musicianship.
Personality
It is generally conceded that congenial, friendly, sympathetic, and dynamic personality is fundamental to good leadership. Such a personality emanates from the heart, and is far more appealing and persuasive in its effect than much reasoning and cultivated veneer.
Tact
Tact is the door to success in any endeavor. It is that characteristic quality wherewith one understands prejudices and misunderstandings. Through tactful approaches, individuals and groups are made to see newer and broader horizons and wider and higher perspectives. These urges are indispensable to wholesome and progressive results in leadership.
Organizing Ability
Proper and appropriate organization is fundamental to every enduring structure in society. Ability to effect it is, therefore, a gift to be cherished. In music leadership, this gift is of utmost importance.
Humor
Humor is a social lubricant. People of experience know that where reason fails, humor succeeds. Negative conditions are eliminated through its application. In music leadership, negative conditions frequently arise that can be corrected or adjusted only through the subtle power of humor. It is well to remember that humor laughs with people, and not at them.
Musicianship
By musicianship is meant a broad and thorough understanding of all necessary branches of music. A few of these are:
(1) Ability to read and interpret the ordinary page of music. This involves: (a) standard of rhythm; (b) keys (major and minor); (3) tempo (speed and rhythm); (4) dy-
Page 185 186  (4)dynamics (loudness or softness of volume); (5) clef signs; (6) notology (notes, rests, dots, etc.); (7) symbology (signs, repeat marks, sharps, flats, etc.); (8) terminology (terms relating to rhythm, tempo, dynamics, etc.). The following books will prove invaluable in the study of the above elements of musicianship: Elson: Music Dictionary, Ditson R. S. Smith: Elementary Music Theory, Ditson Gherkens: Fundamentals of Music, Ditson Gherkens: Terminology and Notation, A. S. Barnes Wedge: Ear Training and Sight Singing, G. Schirmer Diller: First Theory Book, G. Schirmer (9) Aural training (ear-training), learning how to hear and to perform what appears on the printed page of music; (10) technique of the baton and the routine of conducting, (definite baton patterns and a standard system of procedure in conducting). For the study of conducting, use: Gherkens: Essentials in Conducting. Wodell: Choral Conducting. Cornwall: Conducting. (11) Proper discrimination in the choice of song material that is appropriate and suitable to the group; (12) the philosophy and psychology of interpretation (discovering and expressing the context of the word message and the content of the musical meaning). For this study, use: RELIEF SCCIETY MAGAZINE�MARCH 1947 Lusey: Expression in Singing, Novello. Britan: The Philosophy of Music, Longmans, Green. M. G. Evans: Primer Facts About Music, Presser Co. (13) The art and beauty of singing (the correct and normal method of singing, pure and prolonged voweling, distinct and quick consonants, resonant and rich tone quality ). The following books will be found helpful in this last named branch of study toward musicianship: Green: Psychology of Singing, MacMillan & Company. Witherspoon: Singing, G. Schirmer. Fillebrown: Resonance in Singing and Speaking, Ditson. Gould: Successful Singing, Axelrod Publications. It should be evident, from the above discussions, that the spirit and power of leadership can be acquired through diligent, constant study, and through regular practice. It may begin from any level of present musical ability and attainment. It is earnestly hoped that all stake and ward Relief Society officers interested in musical activities will be deeply concerned with the need and desirability of progressive leadership in their work, as briefly suggested and outlined in this article. It would be to the advantage of all concerned to have within the Relief Society libraries, books from the above lists on the various branches of music, which can be used as needed by those who are directing the music activities of the organizations.
