"The Barren Desert Is a Fruitful Field"' Louise Lee Udall An Account of the Exploration and Early Settlement of Northeastern Arizona HE early settlements made by 'the Latter-day Saints were the growth of certain plants that spread by sending out cunners, which reach out until they find conditions favorable, and then take root, forming a new unit. Within twenty years from the time the Original pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley, the valleys of Utah had been colonized to the southern most boundaries, Scouts and explorers always preceded the settlers, The first group to cross the mighty Colorado River into Arizona, in response to instructions from President Young, was led by Jacob Hamblin. The object was to make friends with the Indians, teach them the 8ospel, if possible, and see what the Prospects might be for colonization, There were twelve men in Hamblin's party, including an Indian guide. They left the Santa Clara settlement, in Southern Utah, October 28, 1858, on came to the Crossing of the Fathers, the place where Spanish Missionaries had crossed the Colorado, in 1776. '� crossing was made in safety, and a continued journey of several brought the scouts to a Hopi Indian village in Northern Arizona, Page 162 on the south side of the Colorado River, The Indians were friendly, providing welcome food and shelter. Ne very old man said that when he was young, his father had told him that he would live to see white men come among them, from the West, who would bring great blessings, and that he believed this prediction was fulfilled in the coming of these Mormons. Several villages were visited, and 800d will prevailed. After a few weeks, it was decided that the main part of the stoup should return, It as considered advisable to leave a few of the brethren with the Indians to hear their language and their to William Hamblin, Andrew S. Gibbons, Thomas Leavitt, and Benjamin Knell to remain. At first, they were well treated. They taught the Indians to make ladders, using nails instead of buckskin string. Then, some jealous Indian priests stirred up feeling against the missionaries, and the chief advised them to eave. Their return journey, in the winter Snows, was fraught with cold and hunger. This first trip is typical of many that followed. wagon trail was charted over the cliff country from the ferry to the Little Colorado River, a branch of the great stream. Many of the hardy missionaries and frontiersmen made repeated journeys. In the spring of 1873, the first party of prospective settlers, consisting of ten wagons, and known as the "Haight Expedition," crossed the river and went part of the way to the Little Colorado, but the maze of steep canyons and the dry barren desert discouraged this party, and they gave up and returned to Utah. In a report which this company sent to Bigham Young, the country was described as barren, with narrow river bottoms, alkaline soil, very little water, and that bad. No spot was discovered by this company which was considered fit for settlement. Henry Holmes, a member of this vanguard company, wrote in his journal many references to the "forbidding" country. One excerpt is noteworthy in this connection: The country is rent with deep chasms, made still deeper by vast torrents that pour down them during times of heavy rains.... However, I do not know whether it makes any difference whether the country is barren or fruitful, if the Lord has a work to do in it. Again, in October of 1875, a scouting party headed by James S. Brown, a former member of the Mormon Battalion, was sent out from Salt Lake City. They established headquarters at Moenkopi, about sixty miles from the Big Colorado River; they explored the Little Colorado country, and_ returned with a favorable report. There were many springs at Moenkopi, and it became a missionary outpost and oasis for later Arizona pioneers. BY 1878, there were four settlements in Arizona in the vicinity of what is now Winslow and Joseph City (St. Joseph) on the Little Colorado River adjacent to the Navajo lands and the now famous Painted Desert, and directly north of the wild Apache country. Thus, the settlements lay between two' fierce and hostile Indian tribes. The Indians, however, gave the settlers very little trouble. From a drawing by John E. Weyss Courtesy, United States Geological Survey THE CROSSING OF THE FATHERS Twenty-five Miles Above Lee's Ferry on the Colorado River "THE BARREN DESERT IS A FRUITFUL FIELD" 163 164 These settlements were organized into the Little Colorado Stake, with Lot Smith as its president, and Jacob Hamblin and Lorenzo S. Smith as counselors. This was the first stake organization effected in Arizona. In order to exist, it was necessary for the saints to work together, and these communities lived the "United Order." Responsibility for bringing water to the land, farming, stock raising, dairying, and lumbering was delegated to each man, according to his training and ability. A community kitchen served meals at a common table, to as many as one hundred fifty at a time. Bakers and cooks presided in the kitchen, the women and girls taking turns as helpers. Friendly Indians came to trade blankets or yards of heavy, dark jeans cloth, furnished them by the Government, for melons or fruit. Sometimes they came to get some sewing done on the sewing machines, which fascinated them. The four settlements on the Little Colorado were: Allen's Camp (later named St. Joseph after the Prophet Joseph Smith), Lot Smith's Camp at Sunset, George Lake's settlement at Obed, and Jesse O. Ballenger's settlement (later named Brigham City) near the present site of Winslow. At Allen's Camp, the first plowing was done on March 2s, 1876, by John Bushman and Nathan Cheney. Jacob Morris immediately began to build a house. An irrigation ditch was surveyed and on April 3, Bushman planted the first wheat. The first child, Hannah Marie Colson, was born July 17, 1876; and a year later, the first death, that of Clara Gray, occurred. THE Little Colorado proved to be a treacherous stream. The first LEE'S. FERRY, ARIZONA This famous ferry is located at the point where the Paria enters the Colorado River. The bridge over Marble Gorge is seven miles downstream from Lee's Ferry. Courtesy, Josef Muench STREET SCENE IN A HOPI VILLAGE The Pueblo Indians retain many of their old habits of living. Burros haul wood for the fires; corn and peppers dry at the doors; and there are always dogs running in and out. Dam, made jointly by Allen's Camp and Obed, cost the settlers $5,000. {In the first flood, the water rose twelve feet and the dam went out. In 1877, another dam was washed away. Other dams were washed out in 1881 and 1882. 'The Church historian, Andrew Jenson, reported that at least $50,000 had been lost by this community in the construction of insecure dams. He called St. Joseph the "leading community in pain, determination and unflinching courage in dealing with the elements around them." In 1894, St. Joseph had completed its eighth dam across the Little Colorado, and Joseph W. Smith, in writing of the dedication of this dam, remarked upon the rosy-cheeked, well-clad children, "showing that the people were by no means destitute, even if they had been laboring on ditches and dams so much for the last eighteen years." The prayer offered at the dedication of the dam was characteristic of pioneer courage: "O Lord, we pray that this dam may stand, if it be thy will�if not, let thy will be done." When William J. Flake came to Snowflake, some fifty miles southeast of Winslow, in 1878, he found that James Stinson had been there for five years, and had three hundred acres of land under cultivation along the upper branches of the Lit. Tle Colorado. Flake bought Stinson's interest for $11,000 worth of cattle. Soon families began moving in. Apostle Erastus Snow, in charge of colonization in Arizona, organized the Snowflake Ward, naming it in honor of the first settler and for himself as a representative of the Church. A stake, em "THE BARREN DESERT IS A FRUITFUL FIELD" 165 166 bracing what is now both Snowflake and St. Johns Stakes, was formed and named Eastern Arizona Stake, with Jesse N. Smith as its president. Ammon M. Tenney led a group of settlers into St. Johns, about fifty miles east of Snowflake and near the New Mexico border, late in 1879. They found that this valley, also, was already occupied by "Gentile" ranchers. 'Tenney bargained to pa six hundred and fifty head of cattle in exchange for squatter's rights. By 1887, many other families had settled in this locality and the Eastern Arizona Stake was divided, creating the Snowflake and St. Johns Stakes. Jesse N. Smith and David K. Udall, respectively, became presidents. Those who pioneered the early settlement of Arizona came from Utah in response toa call from their Church. Their average age was thirty years. They were just getting established in life. Many of them had small families. Their farms and gardens were beginning to yield the fruits of their labor. They loved Utah's mountains and valleys, and their dream of the future was rudely broken by such a call. They would have preferred to remain where they were, instead of moving to Arizona, where hard work and scanty fare awaited them. David K. Udall, at twenty-nine years of age, had a wife and one child. He went to Glendale, Utah, thirty miles from his home in Kanab, to attend quarterly conference. There, he was informed that he was called to go to St. Johns, Arizona, to preside as bishop of that ward. He was, then and there, set apart to that calling, and directed to proceed to Arizona as soon as possible. He settled his business affairs, and, after thirty days on the road, he arrived in St. Johns in October 1880, THIS moving to Arizona was a major project, indeed. Besides leaving their beloved home and going to a new country, it meant that, with the miles between, and travel as it was then, they would see their loved ones left behind seldom, if ever, again. And, although they left with sad hearts and many misgivings, none thought of refusing the call. They took up the burden and went to work with a will to make new homes and build up the stakes of Zion. The day-by-day journey in the covered wagon was like that of other such pilgrimages. Only a few Pieces of furniture, or heirlooms, could be taken. The load consisted mostly of food, warm clothing, and bedding. The miles covered each day were gauged by watering places. The journey was slow and greatly impeded by loose stock, driven by horsemen. Threshing machines and _gristmill and sawmill machinery were taken along. Heading south from Utah, over the Kaibab Mountain, down House Rock Valley, with the towering Vermillion Cliffs at their left, they wended their way. Then, they turned and traveled for forty miles, with canyon walls closing in, until they came to the river and the ferry. Crossing the mighty Colorado was hazardous. Several days were required to ferry the wagons and swim the cattle. As they set foot on the south side, another and equally dangerous obstacle _ confronted them. The trail up and over "Lee's Backbone" (the rocky ridge that juts into the river) was steep and the road narrow and rocky. A prayer of gratitude was felt in every heart, once these two milestones were passed. On and on they went until, finally, one day, they looked over the hill into the valley on the headwaters of the Little Colorado, which was to be home. And, somehow, though it was barren, it looked beautiful to them. Soon their dreams began to develop, their towns began to grow, and the desert valley became green and beautiful. In considering the events, big and little, that make up life under such circumstances, the fortitude of the frontiersman and his family must be recognized. Their fears must have been allayed with faith and prayers. The Lord did help them. But hardships were many, and the Arizona settlements had their share of trouble. Once, a father, being obliged to go to his field to reap his harvest, took his two boys with him, leaving two little girls, about three and five, alone each day. No wonder they visited the motherly neighbor often at noon, and were as often fed by her. One day, coming in just as the meal was finished, they stood looking at the table. The mother said, "Well, girls, it looks as if we have eaten everything. There is nothing left but crumbs." The smallest girl answered, "Well, Sister Lytle, do you care if we pick up the crumb? Sister Lytle soon found more than crumbs. Diphtheria, scarlet fever, and smallpox brought panic in their wake, in some instances taking a toll of all the little ones in a family. Mute evidence of such may be seen to this day in the older part of the cemeteries, where one may see three or four small headstones in a row whose names and dates show deaths of the very young, from the same family, within a period of a few weeks. In a certain family of four small children, the second child was being  167 168 buried, the third was already stricken with diptheria, and the fourth one looked up at his mother and said, "Where will we bury Harriet?" Harriet was buried alongside the others. Diet was woefully lacking in vitamins and, often, in calories. Coarse wheat bread was literally the staff of life. White flour, freighted by team from Albuquerque, two hundred fifty miles away, was a luxury. Something to eat with the bread made a meal unusual. A craving for something sweet made the first melons taste better. Fruit and vegetables were an unusual treat. Homemade molasses made many a slice of bread into a real delicacy. A can of tomatoes was a treasure to be hoarded and used only in time of sickness. The wrapper from the can, with its big, red tomato on the dark green background, gave a bright touch to the sickroom, from its place just under the clock shelf, pinned on the newspaper-covered wall. The can itself became a cup and was placed by the water bucket on the bench. Special event in a pioneer home in the 80's was one Sunday dinner. There were guests, a man and his wife from thirty miles away, friends of yesteryear, in Utah. And, for dessert, pie. Cherry pie, made from the first fruit of the little tree. The husband had brought his wife on this visit, hoping that new faces and scenes might help assuage her grief at the loss of her baby from dysentery, and restore her mental balance. In her grief, this mother had "ceased her own to cherish," and was not concerned about her other children. The pies were eaten, all but one piece, which the hostess saved to give to her married daughter, who was expecting a baby. But when the daughter came, the pie had disappeared. In her great disappointment, the wife cried.
Seeing a grown-up woman crying for a piece of pie, the woman, who was a guest, went to her husband and said, "Where are my children? I want to go to them. I am afraid they are hungry."
The horses were harnessed immediately and it was with a lighter heart the husband started home.
Another incident in Arizona pioneering illustrates the courage and the faith of Latter-day Saint farmers in the desert valleys.
It was the first time in his life that twelve-year-old LeRoy Gibbons, little brother in a large family, had been away from home. After two weeks helping his older brother care for the cattle, imagine his feelings as he came in sight of his home again. He crossed the river and came up the lane. He saw his elderly father standing at the gate to let down the bars and welcome him. The father and son were the best of friends.
As the boy got out of the wagon, his father laid his hands in his pockets, and in the pockets were peaches, four of them, from the fruit trees they had raised together.

"Here, take them," the old man said, "Here, my boy, I have saved two of the nicest peaches of that first tree for you. There is one thing I want to tell you as I give you these peaches. Since I arrived in Utah, on July 24, 1847, I have put out thirteen orchards and have never eaten the fruit from one of them until now, and I have never once moved without being called by the authorities of the Church." Early in 1880, the railroad company began building its roadbed west from Albuquerque. A contract for grading was taken by John W. Young, a son of Brigham Young, Jesse N. Smith, and Ammon M. Tenney, in order to provide work and food for the people. The project began in July, and about forty men and teams went to work. With their first pay, a load of flour was purchased, which brought welcome relief. Other contracts were taken and the work lasted several years. Later, it was found that the light spring wagon in which John W. Young came to Arizona, had been abandoned near a ranch about twenty miles from St. Johns. The story was that this was the very wagon in which Brigham Young rode into Salt Lake Valley, when he made the prophetic utterance, "This is the right place." The story was brought to the attention of the brethren in Salt Lake City and was verified by t hem. Then, the wagon was brought into St. Johns by David K. Udall, where it stood under a shed until 1893, when it was taken apart and shipped to Salt Lake City. It now stands, with other historic relics, in the Utah State Capitol. The early pioneers of Northern Arizona builded with their hearts, and with their hands, and the land became to them and to their descendants, the dearest spot on earth, "home." And 'The valleys sing, and the hills rejoice, and the barren desert is a fruitful field. Joy and gladness now are found therein; thanksgiving, (From the anthem "Let the Mountains ty miles from St. Johns, The Story Shout for Joy," words and Music by Evan was that this was the very wagon in Stephens, based on Isaiah 51:3) Courtesy, M.
