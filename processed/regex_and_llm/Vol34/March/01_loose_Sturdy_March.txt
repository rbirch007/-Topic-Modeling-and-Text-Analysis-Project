STURDY MARCH Amelia Ames March is a pioneering month, Sweeping, with gallant bow, Down from the crest of winter, Dreaming of seed and plow; Visioning billowed wasteland Plushed in the jade of spring, Daring scourge and flood to mar The golden blossoming! No month has the faith of March; Through the long trek of years, He speaks the word of promise. And the promised land appears!
