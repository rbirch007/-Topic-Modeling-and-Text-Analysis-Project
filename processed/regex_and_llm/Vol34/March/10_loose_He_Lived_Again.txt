HE LIVED AGAIN Caroline Eyring Miner The morn had come at last, and Mary's feet, Stayed only by the darkness, swiftly ran; She laid her head against the tomb, the sweet And gracious person of the Holy Man Of God, her Master, to adore in death, As she had done in life. She stopped, amazed, Was this the place? This tomb gaped wide, the earth Where he had been, lay bare, and Mary, dazed, Despairing, wept, and questioned him who kept The gardens, as she thought: My Master, where Is he? My Master? Then her sad heart leapt. He spoke. The mystery and tears and care That burdened her, dissolved like mist or rain. Her Master lived; though dead, he lived again!
