WHO MAKES A GARDEN Della Adams Leitner Who makes a garden knows another world Than he who lives in hurried, clamorous ways; The joy of finding tender buds unfurled Eases the tasks and strain of hardest days. For flowers have a secret all their own * To speak to those who love them, and to tell God's way is good; in seed, his plan is shown, And, following it, they find that all is well. "Charity Never Faileth" INCE my husband's return from the hospital, I, who am past seventy-four, have 7 had the entire care of looking after and doing everything for him. I have been, and still am, very busy, but have had wonderful help and assistance from the members of the little branch of Relief Society. Your sigers in the Society here are truly doing, or trying to do, their duty. As members of the Society, they have been most kind, although the headquarters are, and most members live, more than twenty miles from us, still they have visited us often. Sister Lucy Critchlow, president of the branch, and her daughters and daughter-in-law come often to clean up the house, and have been doing the washing and ironing all through our trouble. All members have been very kind in keeping us well supplied with eggs, milk, and butter. Although they are few in number, I wish to say the Relief Society of the Renfrew Branch is most surely trying to do good. G. W. S. West Sunbury, Pa.
