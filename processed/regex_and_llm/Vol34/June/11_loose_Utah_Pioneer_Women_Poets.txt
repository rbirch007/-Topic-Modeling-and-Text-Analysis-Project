Utah Pioneer Women Poets Rose Thomas Graham "Poetry is the human emotion seeking a way through the wilderness and struggle." RAB would have been the lives of our Utah pioneers were it not for their singers and poets. Theirs, indeed, was wilderness and struggle in sagebrush lands. But God put poetry into the hearts of these brave people, and those who expressed this poetry gave hope to the sorrowful and discouraged and received joy themselves. Talents were not hidden under a bushel. Though poverty and hard work were the heritage of the desert, though books were few and opportunities for education limited, particularly in the outlying settlements, many women expressed themselves in poetry which reflected the courage and vitality of pioneer life, as well as the lasting beauty and culture in the hearts of the women. Though the principal theme of pioneer poetry was the establishment and growth of the Church and the work of women as mothers and homemakers, still, many of the authors were deeply interested in national and world affairs, in history and government, in geography and travel, and in the various religious movements beyond the borders of Utah. Some of the most significant poetry portrayed the grandeur of the mountains and the beauty of the arid valleys, the color of wild flowers on the hills, and the blue depths of the mountain lakes, the peace and comfort which the "promised land" gave to the latter-day pilgrims who had spent so many years seeking a safe retreat in which to build their homes and establish the stakes of Zion. Eliza R. Snow Foremost among Latter-day Saint poets, stands Eliza R. Snow, the "sweet singer of Israel," sister of Lorenzo Snow, fifth president of the Church. She received an excellent education and was associated in young girlhood with Alexander Campbell and other well-known religious leaders. Thus she became interested in the philosophy of Mormonism and became a member of the Church. Having cast her lot with the saints, she followed their migrations from Ohio to Missouri and into Illinois. In every phase of pioneer history she was a leader among women, and became the secretary in the first Relief Society organization. Eliza R. Snow has truly been called the poet laureate of Mormondom, for she celebrated in vibrant verse the history of the Church. For subject material she used the arrival of the saints in their various temporary homes and their forced departures to new locations. She wrote of events in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith and portrayed his teachings in her poems. She told of the beauties of Nauvoo and the sadness of the exodus. This cultured woman, frail of stature, drove an ox team part of the Page 387 way across the plains. She shared in all the hardships and ministered tirelessly to those who were ill or discouraged, those who had suffered the loss of loved ones, and those who seemed to regret leaving their comfortable homes for the precarious life of the wilderness. Her tasks in the valleys of the mountains embraced a multitude of very different skills. She became proficient in spinning, weaving, sewing, and other household tasks. She was an ordinance worker in the temples; she cared for the sick, comforted those who mourned, and assisted all who came to her for counsel and advice. While traveling in Europe with her brother Lorenzo and _ other Church officials, Eliza R. Snow was greatly impressed by the beauty of the landscape and by the old buildings and the history connected with them. Her description of Florence is typical of her impressions during this visit: Beneath high, villa-dotted hills, That in succession rise Like rich, gemmed parapets around, The lovely Florence lies. It was, however, her visit to the Holy Land that touched Eliza R. Snow the most deeply, and she was forever grateful for what seemed to her a sacred privilege: I go to place my feet upon the land Where once the Prince of Peace, the Son of God Was born where once he lived and walked and preached.... "Sister Eliza," as she was affectionately called, became the first General President of Relief Society in Utah, and in this capacity she ELIZA R. SNOW traveled extensively and delivered hundreds of inspirational addresses which, in themselves, were literary masterpieces. 'The development of the ideals and the great accomplishments of Relief Society became marvelous as shaped by the women of pioneer times, and the intelligent mind and brilliant talents of Eliza R. Snow contributed much to this development. In writing of the Relief Society, Sister Snow explained its mission: It is an institution formed to bless The poor, the widow, and the fatherless; To clothe the naked, and the hungry feed, And in the holy paths of virtue lead. "O My Father," the famous song lyric written by Eliza R. Snow, is regarded as a masterpiece and its lines are known and loved all over the world, and revered by many people who are not members of the Church. UTAH PIONEER WOMEN POETS Here the simplicity of wording, the power of inspiration, and the theme of a great message are combined to make this song "the living letter of music." Charles Dana Gibson, Editor of the New York Sun, in 1897 listed this poem as first in his list of the ten best poems in the English language. The poet of the Mormon migrations, the sweet singer of the valleys, became known far beyond the boundaries of Utah. It is in honor of this pioneer poet that the Eliza R. Snow Memorial Prize Poem Contest is conducted by the General Board of Relief Society, and the women of today who enter their poems in this contest are following in the pathway of one who sang her way to a place of usefulness and beauty forever in the hearts of Latter-day Saint women. There's a depth in the soul, that's beyond the reach Of all earthly sound of all human speech, A fiber too sacred and pure to chime With the cold, dull music of Earth and Time.... Hannah Tapfield King Hannah T. King, "a leader from England," became a leader among the women of Utah, where she taught school for a number of years, and also contributed prose articles and poems to the Woman's Exponent. Some of her poems were written as advice to young girls, and two books, popular with the English aristocracy, came from her pen: The Toilet, dedicated to "her girls" and The Eras, dedicated to "her boys." Exemplifying her work, is this poem: 389 Courtesy, Kate B. Carter HANNAH T. KING TO A YOUNG LADY FRIEND Walk slowly, walk softly, walk calmly along, Seeking wisdom to guide and direct; That hereafter, when mingling in life's busy throng, It will plainly be seen to what class you belong, And may that be God's own elect. Notable among the writings of Hannah King, is an epic poem dedicated to President John Taylor. Following the true epic panorama, the poem gives a view of Church history, detailing events from the time of the Prophet Joseph Smith to the arrival: of Brigham Young's company at the place which was to become Great Salt Lake City. This poem portrays much exaltation of spirit and deals vividly with the stirring events of pioneer history. Going beyond the presentation of the 390 events themselves, the poet probes the hearts of the people to discover their motives and their purposes, their patriotic and religious sentiments. Hannah King's poem "Let There Be Light," which was published in 1884 in the Woman's Exponent, reveals the poet's attitude toward faith in God and the relationship of faith to the world of nature: Light.... What a world of wealth is light! In all its grandeur, all its might. Light is indeed direct from heaven, The grandest boon to mortals given; And wheresoever it may shine It tells of life and light divine. This genial, life-engendering light Brings untold beauties into sight; No blade of grass could raise its head, No floweret leave its leafy bed, Did not this light upon it shine, The very breath of light divine.. Courtesy, The Salt Lake Tribune Sarah E. Carmichael (Williamson) Sarah E. Carmichael, born in Long Island in 1838, was called the "Golden Singer of the Wasatch" and the "Patriot Poet." One writer speaks of her as "'a spirit throbbing with feeling and ideas." At the early age of seventeen she had many ambitious poems published in newspapers and magazines. But her mind was too big; it failed her when she was but thirty. Had she, in later life, retained the brilliance of her youth, she might have been listed among the great poets of the nation. She wrote with acute
