The Prophet Brigham Young Elder Willian E. Stoker Bishop, South Twentieth Ward, Ensign Stake [This article was written by special request in honor of the birthday of Brigham Young who was born June 1, 1801, in Wittingham, Windham County, Vermont. Ed.] MILLIONS steadily acclaim Brigham Young the greatest pioneer of the nineteenth century. William H. Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State, said, "America never produced a greater man." Some of his critics have said, "Without him Mormonism would have failed." But few have seen, behind the man, the power of God which made him great. Just as "Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him," Brigham was full of wisdom, for Joseph had conferred upon him the keys of the kingdom through the Priesthood of God. Viewing his accomplishments in these valleys, he said, "It is the Lord who has done this. It is not any man or set of men, only as we are guided by the spirit of truth." Fully aware of the powers of the Priesthood he held, he did not hesitate to speak in the name of the Lord, when occasion required. At the death of Joseph Smith, their leader, a spirit of uncertainty was upon the saints. Various men tried to assume the Church leadership. Prominent among them was Sidney Rigdon, who claimed the right to be guardian of the Church. On August 8, 1844, thousands of the saints gathered at Nauvoo to hear Sidney Rigdon present his claims, but they were unimpressed. Then Brigham Young, as President of the Twelve Apostles, stood up in the wagon, which was being used as a pulpit, and prefacing his remarks with, "Attention All," he proceeded to remind that vast congregation that Joseph had conferred upon the apostles, with Brigham at their head, all of the keys and powers which he, Joseph, had received of the Lord. George QO. Cannon, a witness of this meeting, said: If Joseph had risen from the dead, and again spoken in their hearing, the effect could not have been morte startling than it was to the many present at that meeting; it was the voice of Joseph himself; and not only was it the voice of Joseph which was heard, but it seemed in the eyes of the. People as though it was the very person of Joseph which stood before them. The mantle of Joseph had fallen upon Brigham. A sure testimony had been given the people, and from that day forward he was accepted as their leader without reservations. They had heard the voice of the shepherd, and they knew it. The spirit and the power of Brigham Young's calling were already upon him that day in August 1844, when he said: All that want to draw away a party from the Church after them, let them do it if they can, but they will not prosper.... If any man thinks he has influence among this people to lead away a party, let him try it, and he will find that there is power with the Apostles which will carry them off victorious through all the world. Page 363 364 OSEPH had predicted that the saints would go to the Rocky Mountains and become a mighty people, and he had visioned another leader bringing them to the valleys. The Lord had prepared a modern Moses, Brigham Young, for this task. He was sometimes called "the fulfiller." The man for this great undertaking must, of necessity, have been a great spiritual leader, for the saints would have followed no other. Under pressure of the mob, the exodus from Nauvoo, across the Mississippi river, began February 4, 1846. The saints were westward bound, with the few. Earthly possessions which they could take with them. Their condition was pitiable. They had appealed in vain for governmental protection. June 1846 found them camped on the Indian lands of Towa, poor and in dire want. The United States was at war with Mexico, and Captain James Allen was dispatched to overtake the Mormons and recruit a battalion of 500 able-bodied men from their ranks. 'This was a test of loyalty seldom asked of any people. But, on the advice of Brigham Young, they were mustered in, and leaving their families, they began the longest and most difficult infantry march in the history of our land. To them Brigham Young said: Now I would like you brethren to enlist. And go and serve your country, and if you will do this and live your religion, I promise you in the name of Israel's God that not a man of you will fall in battle. He further promised them, on the same condition, that they would not be required to fight. And so it was. Samuel Brannon, who had brought 235 saints from England around Cape Horn to California on the ship Brooklyn, met the pioneer companies on Green River, June 30, 1847, hoping to persuade Brigham to forsake his intention of settling in the barren desert and to come with him to the paradise he had found in California. Brannan predicted that the saints could not possibly live in Salt Lake Valley because the mountaineers had said that there was frost every month in the year. Brigham replied: If there is any place so poor no one else wants it, that is the place for us. Brannon, unable to persuade his leader, returned to his California paradise, left the Church, became wealthy, and later lost his wealth and was buried in San Diego as a pauper. July 24, 1847, when the main body of the first pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young, ill with mountain fever, was assisted so that he could look over the valley from the site of the "This Is the Place" monument. After gazing intently fora few moments, he exclaimed: "It is enough, this is the right place, drive on." How did he know? Because previously, in vision, he had seen this valley, with a tent settling down from heaven and resting, and a voice said to him: "Here is the place where my people shall pitch their tents." He told the brethren who preceded him into the valley that they were to bear to the north after entering, that they would find a stream near which they should camp; they were to begin plowing and planting, and if the ground was hard and sterile, as reported, they should throw up a dam and let the water soak up the land before planting. THE PROPHET BRIGHAM YOUNG 365 THE PROPHET BRIGHAM YOUNG Thus was started the first irrigation by the Anglo-Saxon people. Irrigation has since proved to be the key which has unlocked the hidden wealth of the soil in the entire intermountain territory. GALT Lake Valley was regarded by trappers as a "country God forgot." Few, if any, believed the saints could live here. Speaking of her first view of Salt Lake Valley, Clara Decker Young said: When my husband said, "This is the place," I cried, for it seemed to me the most desolate place in all the world. But Brigham never wavered in his faith that, under the blessings of God, the saints could live and prosper in the valleys of the mountains and raise anything that would grow elsewhere in a similar latitude. July 28, 1847, Brigham Young pointed out the spot where the Salt Lake Temple was to be built. This temple required forty years of hard 366 labor in its construction, and was built in the poverty of the people. In 1853, at the dedication of one of the cornerstones, Brigham said he had seen the Temple in vision not ten feet from where he then stood. Further he said: I have not inquired what kind of a Temple we should build. Why? Because it was represented before me. I see it as plainly as if it was in reality before me. After the cricket war and near famine, there came the cry of gold from California. This was a great test of the faith of the saints, because of their poverty. In 1848, Brigham wrote, ""My greatest fear about this people is that they will get rich and forget God. Some few have caught the gold fever." He counseled them to remain in their comfortable homes and raise grain. Said he: You will do better right here than you will by going to the gold mines.... I promise you in the name of the Lord that many of you that go thinking you will get rich,.... Will wish you had never gone away from here, and will long to come back, but will not be able to do so. Some of you will come back, but your friends who remain will have to help you.... Here is the place God has appointed for His people. Some could not be persuaded to remain. The lure of gold took them away from the Church and many of them never returned. Fifty years later, the writer, as a boy, filled a mission in California and met some of these men and their families. 'They didn't even have the gold. One old man dropped on his knees as we were holding a street meeting in San Diego and said: I haven't heard those hymns of Zion for fifty years. I am out of the Church, and I would crawl on my hands and knees to Utah if only I could get back where I stood with the Lord before I left the saints. Truly, Bigham Young was a great pioneer, but he was much more than that. He was a prophet of the living God to his generation. An apostate later wrote of him: He had the power to center in himself a thousand interests and a thousand hearts. No one could hear him pray and doubt his sincerity. He invited his followers to test his teachings at the Throne of Grace, saying: Every man has the right of receiving revelation for himself. It is the very life of the Church. When the saints have done all they can, the Lord will do the rest. One of his greatest gifts was perhaps that of discernment the power to choose the right men for special assignments. As he sent these men out from headquarters to settle the valleys close by and afar off, he blessed them by the power of the Priesthood he held. He set them apart for the tasks before them, always promising them, in the name of the Lord, success in their labors on condition of obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ. An outstanding example of such promises was the case of Jacob Hamblin, whom he called to labor among the Indians during their early uprisings. Jacob's life frequently hung in the balance, and at times his death at the hands of hostile Indians seemed certain. But, always, his faith was unwavering in the promise of Brigham to him: "If you never shed the blood of a Lamanite, no Lamanite will ever shed your blood"  a promise, in the name of the Lord, (Continued on page 431)
