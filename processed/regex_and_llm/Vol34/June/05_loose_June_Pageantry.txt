JUNE PAGEANTRY Amelia Ames When June bends down the radiant bough And lifts the wondrous yield Of scintillating jewels Upon a jasper field, And calls the meadow lark and thrush To open up the day And thread the folded tv/ilight With silver roundelay, June merely paints the landscape And furnishes the song For love's incessant pageantry To which we all belong .... Lovers new, lovers old, Broken hearts and mended, Living in the mystery That is never ended! The Art of Poetry Writing A SYMPOSIUM OF OPINIONS IN order to assist the women who wish to enter their poems in the Eliza Roxey Snow Memorial Prize Poem Contest, the following short articles on poetry technique are presented. The authors of these suggestions are some of the poets who have been winners in previous contests. Ed. POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE ENTERING A POETRY CONTEST Eva Willes Wangsgaard First Prize 1942; 1946 Second Prize 1939; 1947 DE sure that you have something to say which you feel very deeply. A poetry idea must come as forcefully from the heart as from the head or, perhaps, it should be more from the heart. The subject should have wide appeal. Consider the audience who will read the prize-winning poem. Consider its taste, its interests, its dislikes. Then choose a poem which will please and not offend. Write the poem as beautifully as your knowledge of poetry technique will let you. You would not send your child to a party in shabby clothes. A brain child should be dressed as well. Use words economically. They are your working materials and a mirror of your inner self. Don't let them show that you are careless or wasteful. Don't cheat in small ways or un-consciously. That is, don't use a word just because it rhymes, without Page 370 checking to see if it also carries the exact shade of meaning you need. Of course, faulty poems sometimes win contests because the judges have to choose for appeal, subject matter, current interest, and many other points; and a poem, otherwise: faulty, may still fill more needs than a perfectly constructed sonnet which lacks personality. Poems are like people; it is difficult to find one that has everything. Arrange the progress of your poem climactically, so that it climbs to a good strong ending. Your poem will attract attention if you consider these four points arranged according to their importance: 1. The last line 2. The title 3. The first line 4. The body of the poem In any general contest where the subject is not assigned, heart appeal is almost everything if the poem is written so that it comes through to the reader. THE ART OF POETRY WRITING 371 WORDS AND THEIR WAYS IN POETRY Beatrice Knowlton Ekman Second Prize 1932; 1936; 1943; 1944 POETRY is emotion expressed in rhythm. Poetry is born, verse is made. Wordsworth says: It is the honorable characteristic of poetry that its materials are to be found in every subject which can interest the human mind. Therefore, the raw materials of poetry are human experiences. All poetry is made from these. It is human experience, however, understood and recreated in a special way. The theme of. The poet is life, and it becomes his crown. Shelley said that poetry must be rhythmical, though not necessarily metrical. It is only the reading of poetry that can foster the love of poetry. A poem may be written in sonnet, lyric, ballad, narrative, or dramatic form, but it must have rhythm, emotion, imagination, and utterance. The sonnet is a fixed form and requires a certain train of thought and rhythm. All these forms give a vast field for the conveyance of emotion and thought, and afford good practice for the student. A poem can express a thought, a picture, or a mood, and the beginning of a poem should set the tempo of what is to follow. The materials for the communication of poetry are limited to only one medium, that of words; but. They must be words of a peculiar pattern and grouping. The words should be chosen with just the right atmosphere to give the feeling one wishes to express   colorful words, gay words, swift words, words of inspiration, words of courage. It is the peculiar use of words that makes real poetry and gives us the feeling that A. E. Housman so well describes in his book The Name and Nature of Poetry. In order to write a good poem, one must be thoroughly familiar with the technical knowledge for handling all the tools of the craft. The knowledge of technique makes the poetic thought easier to express when it presents itself in those rare moments of inspiration that a poet feels when something comes, that must be said. In writing poetry, I would like my poems to reach the hearts of those who love beauty as I love it and those who have had the human experience that enables them to understand what I seek to portray. POINTS TO LOOK FOR IN POETRY Christie Lund Coles First Prize 1944; Second Prize 1945 GINCE, to me, poetry is not so communication of thought as it is an emotional experience much, I endeavor when I have finished a poem to see if it has emotional appeal. Or, if it is primarily 372 a poem of thought, I try to see if that thought has been any better expressed in poetry than it might have been in prose. If it has not, the poem should never have been written. Poetry is brief and very compact. It must say in a few lines what would take a page or more in prose. I try to see that it is kept as brief as possible, yet is still understandable to the reader. I have no sympathy with poetry which is so complex that even a second or third reading does not yield both beauty and meaning. [ ask myself, is this of sufficient appeal to the particular type of reader who will read it? Yet, I do not often consciously slant my work to any group, because it is never as good poetry when I do. I try to cut out all inversions, contractions, obsoletisms, and anything that is archaic or trite. I try to make sure that the poem has form, rhythm, and proper meter, yet, in preserving these things, has not lost any spontaneity or simplicity. For, to me, simplicity is the keynote of all beauty. And certainly good poetry first, last, and always should be a thing of beauty to make the blood quicken and the eye mist. Lastly, I ask, does the poem have a universal theme, and will it leave the reader moved, uplifted, and perhaps a little better for having read it? IMPORTANT POINTS IN POETRY Berta Huish Christensen Tied for First Prize 1934 Second Prize 1933; 1935 SEV ERAL points seem important to me in the writing of a poem, and I try to use them as guides in judging my own. However, I realize the truth in Shakespeare's comment that it is far easier to say what should be done than to carry out one's own teaching. ~Originality and freshness of expression are to me prime requisites of a good poem. Most experiences of life have been written about. If there is not a slightly new approach, or original phrasing, why another poem? Unless it fills some specific requirement which would make the treatment intentional, this original phrasing should not give a bizarre or vague effect. The purpose of language is to reveal thought, not to conceal it. Since the rhythmical flow of language is the basis of poetry, a poem should conform to a definite metrical pattern and, if thyme is used, a definite rhyming scheme. A sonnet should be a sonnet. But this conformity should not be achieved by the use of "padded lines'? Whose obvious reason for being is to meet the demand of meter or rhyme. Padded lines and obvious rhyme words are the badge of the amateur. As nearly as possible one should use the exact and most' suitable word for the meaning intended. I feel that the length of a poem should be in keeping with the nature and importance of the theme. Brevity in poetry is a precious and desirable quality.. A certain amount of accuracy and THE ART OF POETRY WRITING consistency in making analogies is a point which I think should be stressed. Confusion results from too many or mixed comparisons. To summarize concretely, one might express the essentials of good poetry in this manner: Originality but not vagueness Conformity but with no "padding" for meter or rhyme Brevity without sacrificing clearness Simplicity but not triteness Sentiment but not sentimentality 373 Length according to the importance of the theme I think that a poem should do something to the reader otherwise why waste time on the writing or the reading of it? Therefore, the aesthetic effect, although an illusive thing to describe, is important. It seems to me that a poem should stimulate thought, enlarge appreciation, or enrich the soul by giving an emotional lift. Always in a good poem there is something to remember. POETRY IS A CRAFT Anna Prince Redd First Prize 1938 OETRY isa craft. Buta poet is not a craftsman until he has learned all the techniques that will help him perfect his art. When there are so many sources from which these techniques may be learned  textbooks, writers' magazines, workshop groups, correspondence courses  it is inexcusable for verse writers not to know them. Yet there are many who do not. They go on using outworn phrases, contractions, inversions, and shoddy poeticisms, and then they grieve because their verses do not win contests, or sell to any of the hundreds of verse markets open to them. The reason for this is that many aspiring poets are shock resistant. They refuse the impact of self-criticism, relying upon the delusion that the enumerated faults of which they tread apply to the work of others, never to their own "inspired" lines. Once we learn that these pitfalls apply to us and do something about it we commence to have our poems published and to win contests. We eliminate 'tis and twas, and all the other objectionable contractions. We say things directly, without inverting the thought for the purpose of a lazy rhyme; we strive for new and vivid phraseology, for clarity, and for that quality of emotion required to make a poem out of what would, otherwise, be just verse. Verse has been described as words arranged according to some conventionalized repetition. Poetry is verse which produces a deep emotional response. One of the things that judges look for in contest poems is a quality which produces this "deep emotional response." Verse may be technically imperfect, yet produce this satisfying response. Poetry of distinction and excellence has both technical perfection and emotional appeal. Poetry transcends verse. It builds upon it, going back into the realm of clarified experience, or the longing 374 for experience. To write poetry requires work. One cannot lack the capacity for work and accomplish anything worthwhile. Revision is a necessity. Study, and revise again! What you read applies to you. Let there be, "more poetry in life, more life in poetry!" AFEW POINTS IN EVALUATING A POEM FOR A CONTEST Dorothy J. Roberts First Prize 1943 POEM is basically emotional spiritual, not a rhythmical scientific treatise nor a rhymed philosophy. It should be made alive by some soul quality which seems to cause the reader's heart to leap in response. Study the great poets for help. There must be a breath of newness, something fresh in mood or outlook, in word or phrase or form, which transmits the peculiar flavor of you. Subject matter is not as important in determining the value of a poem as are mood and treatment. The everyday things that make up the average life are rich in material. Use the plainest objects of home and garden for bold and startling effects. A safety pin, a snail, or a dandelion may as effectively inspire a poem of grace and dignity as a mountain ora sunset. Something should be left unsaid to intrigue the reader's imagination. Your "T's" and "me's", when published, are no longer strictly your personal pronouns. Let them grow beyond you until they include your unknown kin of experience and emotion. Then allow these readers to realize their own spiritual connotation for the physical symbols you present. There should not be too many weighty words in a line. Space heavy, significant words in smooth-flowing settings of simple, musical phrases. Weave garlands of words, search for fitting and unusual action words and adjectives. Paint scenes with your words. Use color amethyst, mauve, umber., ' Take care that the picture and similies agree. Brooks and Warren, in their book Understanding Poetry, criticize, as confusing, the poet who depicts a plant as both a suckling child with its mouth pressed to the earth, and as a woman with decorated hair, and with her arms raised in devotion. Cherish optimism and faith. Your outlook will be reflected in the essence of your lines, whatever flowerlaned or cloud-hung ways your thoughts may take en route to the finale.
