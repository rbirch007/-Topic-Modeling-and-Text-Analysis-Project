VOL. 34 JUNE 1947 NO. 6 Fine Raiment THE journals and diaries in which our forefathers recorded their daily experiences, their plans, and their hopes, have now become a choice part of our heritage. 'There is a wealth of faith, courage, and enduring wisdom revealed in the writings of the men and women who "teared stately columns in the land of Deseret." One pioneer, who lived through the bitter cold of winter in a dugout, wrote a daily account of hardships and hunger, but he recorded, also, his wealth of faith and joy. "We were always hungry and cold, but we managed to clothe our spirits in fine raiment." This valiant Latter-day Saint helped to build the magnificent Manti temple on the very hill in which he had once made his dugout home. He and all his people were proud of the marble edifice which they built during their years of poverty and sacrifice. Temple workers came from the valleys to the north and from the towns to the south. They arose before dawn and made the long journey of many hours in the stinging blizzards of winter that they might perform the sacred ordinances In subduing the arid valleys, there was much hard work and the stern requirements of making a living could never be forgotten, but there was a constant striving for fine raiment to clothe the spirit. The pioneers Page 404 did not expect their tasks to be easy, rather they prayed for strength to overcome the difficulties and the dangers of the frontier. Many journals speak of the responsibility which our forefathers felt towards themselves and towards their posterity in establishing an enduring commonwealth based upon the virtues which they felt would bring lasting strength and happiness to the unknown generations destined to reap a rich spiritual harvest from the ideals which the pioneers nurtured in the mountain valleys. Like all great builders, they looked beyond their. Own span of mortal life toward the time when their dreams would blossom for their children's children. One devout pioneer expressed this thought as follows: I fancy my children in generations to come wondering who their ancestor was and where he came from and what were the circumstances under which he came to America and why he came. I do not think a man does his duty to posterity when he leaves them entirely in ignorance concerning these important matters. I picture to myself the families of my descendants in the coming millenium, having in their possession a record of the labors of their forefathers. It is the realization that no person should live unto himself alone, but rather that he should assume his responsibilities in the eternal plan, that gives the spirit its fine raiment. W.
