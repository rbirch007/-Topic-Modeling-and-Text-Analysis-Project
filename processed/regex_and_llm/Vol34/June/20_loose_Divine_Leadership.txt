Divine Leadership The Testimony of Bishop George Romney Regarding the Accession of President Brigham Young to Leadership of the Church [This account is taken from the written report of Gustave A. Iverson who personally heard Brother Romney's testimony and copied it for preservation as an inspiration to others. The testimony was submitted to Theby Charles J. Ross, a grandson of Bishop George Romney.�Ed.] T was Sunday evening, June 22, 1919. The saints had assembled in a conference session of the Ensign Stake. The Lord had been praised in song and prayer. Silence rested upon the meeting much like a benediction of peace and good will. 'The venerable George Romney, pioneer builder and prominent in the affairs of his city and State� most important of all, a bishop during the major part of a generation, a leader of religious thought, was speaking. With a fervor that betokened vibrant spirituality and an emotion that only a man of God with a vital message could feel and convey to others, and with an urge not to be denied, he gave solemn utterance to facts within his own personal knowledge relating to one of the most remarkable events in the history of a Church characterized by a unique and wonderful existence. The bishop's theme was not unfamiliar to his auditors. Many of them had borne testimony, through the tutelage of the spirit, respecting an actuality about which the speaker gave primary evidence, so that what issued from his lips became confirmation of the virtue of their own. With deep feeling, Bishop Romney made mention of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, and this was followed by a vivid word picture of Page 422 that momentous occasion when the mantle of leadership which had fallen from the shoulders of the Prophet, found an abiding place upon those of Brigham Young. The following excerpts are taken from his testimony as it was delivered by Bishop Romney on the occasion of the conference session. The words were taken down by the writer of this article and preserved in his personal records, hoping for a strengthening of the spirit not only in his own behalf, but of those who might upon appropriate occasion hear the bishop's words repeated. They are submitted here in the spirit which the writer caught on the occasion of their initial utterance: I have heard the Prophet Joseph Smith speak as I never heard man speak, under the influence and power of Almighty God, and I bear you my testimony, which might be the last, that I know with every fiber of my body from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet that every prophecy he ever delivered or uttered about the nations and mankind as to what would take place regarding them previous to the present awful world war has been fulfilled. I knew him personally and can scarcely restrain myself from shedding tears when I contemplate that I saw the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum�men of God, men who sought the welfare of the human family, their only wish being to do good� lying in their gore. I vividly remember seeing the two brothers lying side by side after being killed. The saints felt like little children feel when their parents are DIVINE LEADERSHIP taken away from them. Those were serious times. When the Prophet was martyred and word came to Nauvoo on that bright, sunny morning of the 28th of June, it seemed like the gasp of death. There was not a dry eye among the people. I said the people were all children. But they knew the shepherd's voice. Rigdon and others said, "I am the man, I am the man," but it did not take. The sheep knew better. And when the Twelve returned from the East, I shall never for Sidney. 423 get in this world or in the world to come the scene as Brigham Young arose after Sidney Rigdon had used up an hour and a half delivering an eloquent discourse. When Brigham got up the mantle of Joseph Smith fell upon him. It was Joseph's voice; it was Joseph's appearance, and I testify to you, if I never again do so on earth, in the presence of God and angels, that this is verily the truth. This is true� that the mantle of Joseph did fall upon Brigham Young and the people knew it. The Bright Side Alice Whitson Norton O matter what happens, there is always the consoling thought that it might have been worse; there is a bright side to the darkest cloud no matter how black it may be, if we will but look for the brighter side. It is all in the mind of the individual whether he gropes in darkness: or lives in the sunshine. God did not create us for mourning purposes; and yet there are people in 'his world who take a great delight in looking at the black side of everything. If today is perfect, they make it unpleasant by wondering what tomorrow will be like. Some people carry the worries of their day's work into the home. Home should be the place for relaxation of the tired, weary brain, the pleasure ground of every normal thinking individual, but the sanctuary is often abused. A man goes home taking all his troubles with him; the children come home bringing all their perplexed thoughts; the mother, tired out by the work at home, feels the mental depression, becomes irritated and nervous. The dinner is not satisfactory, the evening is spoiled; everybody goes to bed cross, and the morning finds them unfit for a good day's work, prepared only to look for the dark side of the new day. Carrying burdens *home and. Cuddling them throughout the evening and night makes anyone unfit for a good day's work, while an evening spent in happy conversation, good reading, and clean amusement makes any individual feel better, makes him rest better, and prepares him for good service. It is the bright side of things that count. The thing to do in this world is to look each day in the face, make that day stand for something, make it a bright, happy day�let tomorrow take care of itself. It is today we live, today we serve, and today for which we must account. Yesterday is gone, tomorrow may never come; only today is ours, and it is not only the privilege of every individual to make of it something worthwhile, but it is the duty of every individual, also.

This bazaar was outstanding in the number and variety of articles displayed, and in the excellent quality of the work. These sisters have also conducted a successful canning project, and they have been zealous in the care of the sick and needy. They have truly lived the gospel and carried out the objectives of Relief Society. ERRATUM: The note from San Fernando Stake, published on page 205 in the Magazine for March 1947, credited the West Glendale Ward with the pictures of the November bazaar. However, these photographs were received from the East Glendale Ward. Under the direction of President Florence Hill Dalton, the members of East Glendale Ward Relief Society made the articles and prepared the beautiful displays on sale at that unusually successful bazaar. 428.

PERCEPTION Clarence Edwin Flynn Beyond the range of vision beauty dwells; Beyond the reach of hearing music rings; Beyond our understanding wisdom tells The deeper meanings of created things. Who am I to insist that what appears Alone is real, or hold life's wonder bound, Or to deny the music of the spheres, Because I have no way to catch its sound? Perhaps another world around me lies, With higher beings dwelling near te me, Like certain rays unnoticed by my eyes, But far more real than are the things I see. One day death's fingers will unveil my sight, Unstop my hearing, and unloose my mind. Then I shall know a universe of light To which the flesh so long has made me blind.
