Her poem "Moonrise on the Wasatch" shows delicacy and a tender beauty: The wind seemed far, yet darkness was not deep..... ALLL SARAH CARMICHAEL UTAH PIONEER WOMEN POETS The languid air crept to the rose's lips and perished there.... One of her poems, combining strength and delicacy, is "The Mines," which was greatly admired by William Cullen Bryant. He changed the title to "The Origin of Gold" and included the poem in his great collection A Library of Poetry and Song. Part of this famous poem is quoted below: There's a light that burns with a quenchless glow, In the wide deep caverns of earth below; Like the fire that lives on the Parsee's shrine Is the amber torch of the lighted mine. Burning forever, steadily bright; Burning forever, so still and deep, Flickering never, a changeless light; Proud and passionless, still and fair; Burning forever, without a glare; A quenchless flame in a dreamless sleep... The matchless ode "Abraham Lincoln's Funeral" is considered Sarah Carmichael's masterpiece. Here great strength and vigor mingle with a deep compassion. Many critics have placed this great ode as equal, if not superior, to Walt Whitman's "O Captain, My Captain." Toll! Toll! All rivers seaward wend. Toll! Toll! Weep for the Nation's friend.... Toll!

Augusta Joyce Crocheron Augusta Joyce Crocheron, born in Boston, was taken by her parents, at the age of two, to live in San Francisco. Years later, she came with her family to Utah and served as secretary in both the Relief Society and Y. L. M. I. A. Her mother was called "The Mormon Nightingale." Of Augusta, herself, Emmeline B. Wells once wrote: "She seemed to me to always have the wrong setting; so refined, so gentle, so desirous of everything beautiful, and yet denied them all." She is author of three books, Wild Flowers of Deseret, The Children's Book, and Representative Women of Deseret. At the time she died, in 1915, she was also working on a story 392 of The Book of Mormon in verse. Following are excerpts from two of her longer poems: LUCY SMITH The Prophet's mother! On her breast The sacred infant slept. From infancy to youth, her love Its faithful watch care kept; And from his life a gentle child's  Whose earliest words she taught, Her ear and heart with joy received The wondrous truths he brought. SALT LAKE CITY All the valley lay in shadows Cast by clouds that hid the sun; Ripened grain fields, em'rald meadows, Shining lines where waters run..... Emmeline B. Wells - "Aunt Em," a dear little lady who loved pale blue in a neckpiece or as a trimming and who, on April 29th, 1921, was laid tenderly away in a blue-gray casket, is well remembered by many still living. Emmeline B. Wells was born Emmeline Woodward, in Petersham, Massachusetts, February 29th, 1828, of English descent. At an early age she had a strong leaning toward literature and did some writing. This probably led to her later profession. In 1842 the fourteen-year-old girl was baptized, and, in 1844, her mother sent her to Nauvoo, fearing the influence of her many friends who were not in sympathy with the Latter-day Saint religion. She, however, remained staunch in her belief. At Winter Quarters she followed the teaching profession until her journey to the "Valley" in 1848 where, almost from the time of her arrival, she was engaged in public labors for the benefit of women. Two years after her husband, Bishop Newell K. Whitney, died, she married Daniel H. Wells, and EMMELINE B. WELLS spent the rest of her life in security with her family. Annie Wells Cannon, one of her three daughters, was a writer and well-known figure in the Church. The Woman's Exponent, established in 1872, was edited by Lula Greene Richards until 1877, when Brigham Young appointed Emmeline B. Wells as the second editor. One year before this time, President Young had commissioned Mrs. Wells to head the grain-storing movement among women, which duty she faithfully performed. In October 1910, President Joseph F. Smith appointed Emmeline as General President of the Relief Society, a position which she held until her release, only three weeks before her death, April 25th, 1921. At a Professional and Business Women's Convention held in Mackinac Island, Michigan, in 1929, Em- UTAH PIONEER WOMEN POETS meline B. Wells was voted the outstanding woman of Utah the one who had given the greatest service to her State. On this occasion she was impersonated by Elizabeth Fitzgerald, a little, ladylike teacher of West High School, who wore Mrs. Wells' paisley shawl, and resembled her in face and figure. On the one-hundredth anniversary of Emmeline's birth (February 29th, 1928), a marble statue of her, the work of Cyrus E., Dallin, was un. Veiled at the Utah State Capitol. It was the gift of the State in remembrance of. The women of the State, and the first bust in Utah's Hall of Fame. At that time the bust was draped with the same paisley shawl worn by Miss Fitzgerald, Emmeline B. Wells wrote much prose and poetry, in the Exponent and elsewhere. Her second volume of poems was published when she was eighty-seven years of age. The song "Our Mountain Home So Dear" is one of her lyrics. The following excerpts give an idea of her trials, and her later joy in the security of her home and family: SOMEWHERE I see adown the Shadows of long years The faint dim outlines of a dreamy land... The keenest hopes and joys my life has known, And silent griefs which I have borne alone. THE DEAR OLD GARDEN My dear old garden! Still I call it mine; and mine it is, for in its grateful shade.... My children and my children's children A FRAGMENT I only place my hand in thine, and all my Pulses thrill to thee  An indefinable, transporting joy which lifts my soul in ecstasy. 393 Emily Hill Woodmansee Emily Hill Woodraansee, born in England, came to Utah at the age of twenty with the handcart company of 1856. She walked the entire distance of one thousand miles, pulling a handcart all the way. Writing of hardships endured, she said: "T was the youngest of eleven living children, fully enjoying privileges accorded the youngest..... Truly, I never knew what trouble was Til I became a Mormon..... Her well-known hymn "Providence Is Over All" speaks of her faith and trust: When dark and drear the skies appear, And doubt and dread would thee enthrall, Look up, nor fear, the day is near, And Providence js over all, Courtesy, Kate B. Carter EMILY H. WOODMANSEF 394 Lines from her poem "Misunderstood" reveal her sensitive mind: How can a stranger in their grief take part, Whose greatest trouble can be least explained? How can a stranger soothe the aching heart, Whose sorrow must be silently sustained? Sarah E. Russell and Isabel Russell Johnson These sisters, writing under the names of "Hope" and "Millicent," respectively, were born in Canada, where the gospel was brought to their parents by Parley P. Pratt. Their family, with others, suffered mob violence and many trials. Isabel tells of a harrowing experience: One morning the mob came, ordering father to bring out the whole family, saying they would kill them all, starting with the children. Without a word, Father brought out an old shawl, spreading it on the ground, then, one child at a time, and last, taking baby Sarah from her mother's arms, put her down. Facing the mob, he raised his right hand to heaven and said, ISABEL RUSSELL JOHNSON 'Millicent' ) PS SARAH E. RUSSELL ( "Hope" ) "There they are. Shoot, if God will let you!" Awed and subdued, the mob slunk away. These sisters were prominent in Church organizations in Salt Lake City; later, both lived in Mexico. Poems of each, quoted in part, present their talents: THREE EVENING SHADOWS By Millicent Creeping down, creeping down, Shadows with a golden crown.... Tis thus the shades of evening fall In youth, when trustfulness o'er all A tender beauty throws... Falling down, falling down, Shadows with a sable crown. Thus when the veil is rent apart And troubles gather round the heart... Falling down, gently down, Shadows with a snowy crown... Thus when the ills of life are past, And that far shore is won at last, Where shadows never fall...

She walked more than one thousand miles from Council Bluffs to Utah, but she said, "All was repaid at sight of the city of the saints," Following are lines from some of her poems: CROSSING THE ATLANTIC A Reminiscence In January, fifty-three, we left our English home, Determined for the gospel's sake to Zion's land to come..... 395 OUR NATIVE FLOWERS The favored flowers of other lands Have claimed the poet's powers; But let our harp be tuned in praise Of Utah's native flowers. The hymn, "Who's on the Lord's Side, Who?" is from Hannah Cormaby's pen. Lucinda Lee Dalton This poet, writing under the name of Lu Dalton, was born in Alabama, in 1847. She came to Utah in 1849. She began teaching at the age of fifteen, and taught school for thirty-five years in Ogden and in several cities in Southern Utah. Her earlier y ats were spent in San Bernardino, California, where her father, John P. Lee, with others, had been called by Brigham Young to settle. She was a great lover of nature, and author of many poems appearing in the Woman's Exponent. Follow. Ing are lines from her poem "Indian Summer:" Fair Indian Summer, mellow, calm and sweet, Another of thy golden days is done: In mystic silence glide thy viewless feet While sinks again to rest thy gorgeous sun. The herd's faint lowing from the meadow dells Floats like an echo on the dreamy air. The mellow tinkle of their distant bells Suggests faint music from cathedrals fair. Lula Greene Richards This poet, appearing under the name of "Lulu," wrote of herself: "I was born at twelve o'clock noon, April 8, 1849, a bright, smiling Easter Sunday, at Kanesville, Council Bluffs, Iowa." She crossed the plains when she was between three and four years of age, but she remembered the trials endured. Twice she nearly lost her 396 life once when the oxen plunged 'Over an embankment, and again when she was knocked off a boat. At this time her dress caught on a nail and a man was able to reach down and rescue her. She wrote: "At six, I was a real Latter-day Saint." Reaching womanhood, she became a teacher in Sunday School, a secretary in Relief Society, and served in other Church capacities. Her literary talents were discernible at an early age. She was only twenty-three years old when she was called to be editor of the new publication for the women of the Church, The Woman's Exponent. President Young gave Miss Greene this important work as a mission and blessed her in it. Her brilliant and well-trained mind was a significant influence in shaping the policy of this publication, and her personality and her ideals are still reflected in our Church publications, In 1873, soon after she had assumed her editorial responsibilities, Lula Greene became the wife of Levi Willard Richards, and, in 1877, because of increased family duties, she resigned as editor of the Exponent. Her writing days, however, were not over and she continued to contribute to all the Church magazines and to local newspapers and periodicals as well. She became the mother of seven gifted children, among them, the artist Lee Greene Richards. This cultured and gifted woman, who remembered the crossing of the plains, died in September 1944, at the age of ninety-five, the last of the great pioneer women poets. Her book Branches That Run Over the Wall contains many beautiful LULA GREENE RICHARDS nature lyrics, as well as more pretentious poems. "The Sego Lily," quoted, in part, below, is one of her best-known compositions: What other flower so well could represent thee, Dear Utah, in high courts where kings may tread, As the white sego, which once kindly lent thee For thy new guests, new hopes, when hope had fled! There were other women poets in pioneer days, but these are names that appeared most often, and these selections present but few of the words they wrote. Only when a book is compiled on the subject, can early songs and poems be adequately quoted and an insight be gained into the valor and sensitivity that gave expression to "human emotion" in pioneer days. A Place in the Country THE CURTAINS Ruby Scranton Jones [This is the second in a series of five short-short stories  Ed.] the window looking out over the two and a half acres that were theirs, or would be in the course of ten years or so. It was mid-July, and the scrawny apples on the nearest tree were turning red. A few daisies and pansies bloomed in the neglected garden. "Our place in the country," Ellen mused, leaning her dark head against her husband's shoulder. "We have waited nine years for it, but it's worth it. Betty looks better already, and you've coughed very little since we left Chicago." "I was beginning to think you'd have to give up living on a farm when you found that ad in the paper," John replied, putting his arm around her. Then they turned and looked again at the room they had just finished arranging. 'The woodwork and floor were spotless, but the paper was faded and cracked. There was a worn blue rug, much too small, two rocking chairs, a small table with a vase of daisies, and a bright picture of dancing nymphs over the grate. "Nice," Ellen said. "Sometime we'll have a davenport over against that wall and a bookcase in that corner." "For our six books," John laughed. Ellen paid no attention. "But we can have curtains now. I've saved fifteen dollars." She picked up her purse from the table and looked to Jie and Ellen Martin stood at make sure, and then continued, "Sheer curtains that won't shut out the sunshine ruffled ones don't you think, draped back?" "Yes, ruffles, by all means." John drew Ellen to him and kissed her. "I've known we'd have ruffled curtains for nine, long years." Ellen pulled away, a little offended. Then she laughed, too. "Let's go to town now and get the material. I could have them up for Sunday  the front ones, anyway. Some of the neighbors might come to call, you know." She picked up her purse. Again and started for the bedroom. "You call the children while I get ready." As the ancient Ford turned onto the highway, Ellen looked back. "It looks much better than it did a week ago. You've done wonders, John. It'll really look elegant when the curtains are up." The town was busy as country towns are on Saturday afternoons. There were so many cars that John parked some distance from the general store and they walked slowly along, enjoying the sights so unusual to their eyes accustomed to the streets of a big city. The children, a little ahead, had stopped in front of a grain store. "Hurry," Johnny shouted, jumping up and down in excitement. "Come, see the puppies." There was a window full of them, all kinds and colors, rolling over each Page 397 398 other. "I choose that one," the boy exclaimed, pointing to a tan and white furry ball. "He's beautiful." It had Jong been a game with the children to make choices of things they saw in store windows clothes, shoes, books, toys. Of course, they never expected to have them, but it was fun anyway. "Which do you choose?" Johnny asked his sister. "J like the same one. He's so soft looking and, see, he doesn't bite to hurt at all. He's just playing." "We must hurry," their father urged. "The store won't be open much longer." He took Johnny's hand and they went on. An obliging clerk got down bolt after bolt of curtain material before Ellen saw what she wanted. It was snowy white with tiny dots. "How -much?" she asked. "Fifty-nine cents," the girl answered, and started to unroll it. "Twice fifty-nine one eighteen. Six windows. Twelve times one eighteen," Ellen figured scarcely above a whisper, frowning a little in her concentration. "Yes, that will be just right." "Where's Johnny?" Betty asked in a loud, anxious voice. "Why, he was right here," John replied, looking around the store. "We must find him." Ellen hastily turned from the counter and they hurried out. THEY looked up and down the street where cars were traveling in both directions and some boys were galloping their horses. Ellen's face went white. John asked all who passed if they had seen a small boy 'na blue suit. His voice was calm, but he started to cough. "The puppies," Betty cried suddenly and ran down the street. John and Ellen followed. And there he was, his little face pressed against the glass.: "Don't scold him," Ellen whispered. "He likes me," Johnny's voice was shrill. Just then the puppy came over and licked the glass in front of the boy's face with a bright pink tongue. "Oh, I wish I could touch him just once." His voice was low now as though he did not want to startle the puppy. "Come," his father spoke gruffly, taking his hand. "Come, or mother won't get her curtains." "Don't want curtains. Want to watch puppies." Johnny began to cry and pulled away. Elle: marched into the store. "How much are they?" she asked of the man who came to meet her. "Well, different prices. Which one do you mean?" "The tan and white one." "The Scotch collie? He's fifteen - dollars." "So much!" Ellen exclaimed. "That black one is ten. The little spotted fox terrier is only three. But the collie is the best. What do you want a dog for?" "Well, for the children and  for a watch dog." "The collie would be fine then. All collies have good dispositions and they grow big enough to be good watch dogs." Ellen turned to leave and saw her son's face through the glass. It was as full of happiness now as the pictured face of an angel she had seen once in an art gallery. She opened her purse. "Here," she said, "I'll take him." A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY The man reached into the window and lifted out the puppy as three pairs of eyes gazed in surprise. Ellen went out of the store and put the puppy in Johnny's arms. "Is he ours?" he asked when he was able to speak at all. "Yes," she answered. "Now we'll go home. Let Betty carry him to the car. You have to be very careful of puppies, you know." The children started on, talking happily. "But your curtains," John said. "You wanted them so badly." "Did I?" Ellen smiled at him. 399 She was still a little pale. "It's a bad habit I have wanting things." "Well, it's all that's got us this far. But you shouldn't have done it." John took her arm as she stumbled on the uneven pavement. When she next spoke her tone was a little belligerent. "Anyway, who ever heard of a place in the country without a dog?" "When the neighbors come to call they will probably think whoever heard of a house without curtains," John retorted. By the time they caught up with the children, they were both laughing.
