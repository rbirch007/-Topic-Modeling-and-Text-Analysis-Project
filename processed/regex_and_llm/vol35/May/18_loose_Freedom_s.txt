August 15, 1947

May W. Andrus, President, North Idaho Falls Stake Relief Society, reports that this unique flower show provided unusual interest and entertainment.

"Two hundred and fifty women assembled at the flower show and social. The floral theme was brought out in songs by the Singing Mothers and the children (pictured above) in song and dance. The stake tabernacle was fragrant with a multitude of colorful varieties of flowers which graced the stage and covered pedestals, terraces, tables, and steps at various angles, revealing the best in floral glory.

This entertainment climaxed the Centennial beautification program, the theme of which was Let the people plant every tree, shrub, and flower that will flourish in this climate, to make our mountain home a paradise and our hearts wells of gratitude to the God of Joseph."

Many handmade aprons, crocheted chair backs, laundry bags, embroidered scarves, embroidered and stenciled luncheon sets, the majority of these articles being made from feed sacks.

Among the household articles were potholders, dish towels, shoe bags, cosmetic bags, house shoes, knitting bags, hose driers, and many other useful articles.

NORTH WEBER STAKE (UTAH), WILSON WARD THREE GENERATIONS OF RELIEF SOCIETY WORKERS ASSEMBLED IN REUNION AT THE CLOSE OF UTAH'S CENTENNIAL YEAR
In the front row are nine of the thirteen women who have acted as ward presidents since the society was organized as a "Female Charitable Organization of the Wilson Precinct of West Weber Ward, July 10, 1878."
Left to right: Carol C. Nash, present president; Elizabeth H. Wilson, whose parents were early settlers of West Weber. The Wilson Ward was named for her husband's people; Laura C. Platt, granddaughter of one of the founders of Nauvoo, Illinois; Lillian B. Belnap, whose grandmother, Genet Bingham, was the first president of the Wilson Ward Relief Society; Drucilla H. MeFarland, whose grandmother, Sarah Ann Martin, was second president of the organization and counselor to the first president; Melva O. Stratford, present president, of North Weber Stake Relief Society; Gladys H. Sorenson, granddaughter of West Weber pioneers; Esther E. Bingham, granddaughter-in-law of Amanda Bingham, first secretary of the society; Rosalia B. Strickler, whose parents were converts from Switzerland.

Representative of the group in general is Idella M. Johnson, seventh from the left in the next to the top row. She attended the first meetings of the society as infant daughter of Sarah Ann Martin, young pioneer wife who came to the "West-of-Weber" country when it was still inhabited by Indians (1856). Sister Martin was president for twenty-eight years. Sister Johnson has served as treasurer and as a visiting teacher.

The minutes of this society, through the years, show many interesting accomplishments, such as the gradual development of the welfare plan from the time the women went visiting with a baby on one arm and a basket for gathering contributions on the other arm. Carpet rags, homemade soap, wheat, flour, thread, and other items were contributed.

Now, many of these faithful sisters, descendants of the pioneers, are working efficiently in canneries and sewing centers where shiploads of provisions are prepared to aid the people in lands far distant from the home valley.

In a forest of tall trees;
In a field of waving clover
And the hum of golden bees.
There is music, sweet, exotic,
In a gay canary's throat;
In the lark, and in the linnet,
And a wee wren's magic note.
There is music, gentle music,
In the ripples of a mill;
And a steel saw lends enchantment
Butterick McCall's
To a common timber mill.

FRIEND Grace B. Davis For all the beauty of this lovely tree,
For stately grace and verdant mystery
Of restless leaves whose movements lightly trace
Their graceful patterns as they interlace
In shadowed arabesques upon the velvet sod, My heart sends up its grateful thanks to God.
Her brooding branches gently sway and bend
To moods of wandering winds that lightly tend
The tiny nestlings as their cradles high
Swing gently to a twilight lullaby.
For shadowed coolness, strength, and majesty,
My heart rejoices in this friendly tree. - Mother's Scrapbook Ida R. Allredge

I was too busy and too carefree then,
And she, too patient far to reprimand.
In comradery, she sought to understand;
The years slipped by and she was laid to rest.
Oh, how I longed to counsel with her then,
Her arms around, my head upon her breast,
To feel her calm assurance once again.
One day I found her scrapbook, worn with age,
And hungrily I scanned each fingered page
My baby face, a lock of golden hair,
Choice sayings and a simple little prayer;
I shed my worries like an old, worn cloak,
For from these yellowed pages, mother spoke.

The perfect man in every way,

Made Gold edges, SECRETS

Ella J. Coulam

I told my deepest secret
To a little humming bird.
She vowed that she would keep it
And never tell a word.
Today, I saw her whispering
To each flower in the sun
I know she's told my secret
To every listening one.

When next I have a message
Of love and kindly word
I'll pretend that it's a secret
And tell a humming bird.

> SUMMONS

Marion Garibaldi

Twig-colored bird,
Stir the gray bough!
Infinite purpose
Everywhere, now!

Rainbows and flowers
Out of the murk.
Mystery, power,
In springtime lurk.

Lily and weed
Their work must do;
Courage, comrade,
Joy summons you!

Father in Heaven, I Thank Thee Arabella Hoke

Father in heaven, I thank thee tonight
For sleep and for rest
And for the stars so bright;
For angels to protect me
Till morning light.
Father in heaven, I thank thee.
Father in heaven, I thank thee today
For health and for strength
To go on my way;
For food and for raiment
And the wind that blows free,
Father in heaven, I thank thee.

From Near and Sar Camilla Eyring Kimball, author of our feature "Let Every Day Be Mother's Day," was born in Colonia Juarez, Mexico. She attended B.Y.U. And U.S.A.C., and taught home economics at Millard Academy and Gila Academy. She is the wife of Elder Spencer W.

Kimball of the Quorum of the Twelve, and they have three sons and one daughter; the eldest son, with his wife and three little daughters, is studying at Oxford University in England; the daughter, with her husband and baby girl, lives in Salt Lake City; the second son is a missionary in New England; the youngest son is a student at the University of Utah. It might interest you to know that your beautiful temple in Hawaii is shown many times on our projection screen from color photographs, which my husband took there on his way home from the islands of the Pacific. Our friends always gasp with delight at one taken of the grounds, a blue pool surrounded by trees. Although my work is unknown to you, your work is quite familiar to me because of those pictures.

Erma Myers Arthur, Vallejo, California.
I should like to thank you for the very fine things you are giving us in the Magazine. Recently my little daughter tore her plastic covered umbrella beyond repair. We read and followed the article by Mrs. Perschon (January 1948) on how to cover an old umbrella frame to our mutual benefit. Now she has a new umbrella; I have a new experience and knowledge. Happy and proud to be a contributor to such a magazine as our Relief Society Magazine. May you find great joy in your work and inspired help for every problem.

"at Jones Gabbott, Salt Lake City, Utah.
Our dear author, what a delightful story "Pankapaw," by Deone Sutherland (March 1948). Surely you make the Page 360 commonplace sublime. I think of Bret Hart making "'Miggles" a soulful story through his love for the plain and unnoticed, Write some more, please.

Cloe B. Rogers, Ogden, Utah.
Incidentally, I surely enjoy The Relief Society Magazine. I read it and pass it on.

Karl Spafford, New England Mission.
Your very fine magazine has an important place in our home. I find my mother and my daughter enjoy it as I do. Success to you in your work is the wish of all Relief Society members everywhere.
