The Art of Beautiful Tone Quality in Singing
PART II

Florence J. Madsen
Member, Relief Society General Board

The language of tones belongs equally to all mankind, and melody is the absolute language in which the musician speaks to every heart (Richard Wagner).

The Laws of Acoustics

BEAUTY of tone is dependent upon the presence of overtones with their fundamentals. To insure the proper predominance of these essential elements the singer must observe the laws of acoustics.
Some of these are:
(a) The motion of the vibrating column must be regular and unobstructed.
(b) The vibrations must be focused in the direction of, and into all possible open cavities for amplification.
(c) There must be no localization of tone in any one cavity, but equal activity to the exclusion of the others. All the cavities of the head and bones of the face are vocal resonators and, therefore, must be used in speaking and in singing.

Listening
Nature has given to men one tongue, but two ears, that we may hear from others twice as much as we speak (Epictetus).
While listening to music one should be so intent upon what he hears that he can recall, at will, the tone quality he has heard, for comparison with other tonal experiences that he might have.

Imitating
One of the most effective means of learning is that of imitating. This fact is voiced by Weiss in the following statement: "Imitation forms our manners, our opinions, our very lives." Imitation also leads to spontaneous originality. This is strongly asserted by Voltaire as follows: "A good imitation is the most perfect originality."
In order to acquire perfect tone quality one must, therefore, imitate the perfect in tonal art.

Reasoning
Reasoning is the cornerstone of all sound thinking.

It is basically essential to a full understanding of beautiful tone quality. Such reasoning should include, at least, the following facts:
(a) To become an aesthetic singer is a distinctive achievement.
(b) To produce beautiful tones one must first submerge his preconceived notions of tone to the more ideal type of tonal quality as heard in the singing of artists.
(c) The characteristics and mechanics of beautiful tones of the arts can be understood only in proportion as they are unfolded and applied in sincere efforts to sing.
(d) Tone quality can be improved only as far as faults are overcome and proper habits established.
It should be remembered that, as Gilpin says, ". . . Good habits are formed by acts of reason. . . ."
LESSON Department Theology The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 11 "He Spake Many Things Unto Them In Parables" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 19, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, December 7, 1948 Objective: To create a desire to study and understand the gospel of the kingdom. Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.
During the early part of his ministry Jesus was popular. In fact, frequently the multitudes surrounding him were so large they would impede his progress. Because of these large crowds, he found it difficult at times to speak to the multitudes. He, therefore, devised the plan of going to the seashore and having his disciples provide a "small ship" which was kept in readiness for him and in which he sat down and spoke to the crowds. The boat would be anchored a short distance from the shore. It was during one of these meetings at the water's edge that he adopted the method of explaining his talks by using parables.
All students admit that the Savior was the Master Teacher of the world. In teaching, he followed no definite plan or method. He drew his examples from nature. He would see a sower at work in a field, a fox running across his path, a woman at a well, and each would provide him a story to illustrate his doctrine. The things of nature were his own creations and, of course, he knew how to use them to the best advantage.
"A Sower Went Forth to Sow"
The parable of the sower was probably the first parable used by the Savior in teaching. Everyone is familiar with this parable, but there are many who contend that it should, in reality, be called the parable of the soil. The story is as follows:
And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: But others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear (Matt. 13:4-9).
This method of teaching was a new one even to the disciples and was a departure from the Savior's earlier method. He, therefore, gave an interpretation to this parable. In brief, his interpretation was as follows:
Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty (Matt. 13:18-23).
Space will not permit the giving in full of all of the Savior's parables. The parable of the sower is given as an example. All of the parables of the New Testament may be studied with great profit. They are masterpieces of beautiful and effective literature. Only a few salient features will be given here.
Above all we should notice that the Savior had prepared well for his listeners. He was the sower. However, the parable would apply to any authorized servant of the Lord. "The seed is the word of God." He described four grades of soil. First, the compacted roof or highway made by people and hindered animals walking along or over it. It was natural for those near these highways even to cross fields which had been sown to grain. Second: the shallow soil, underlaid by rock, would sustain the sprouting plant only for a short time, after which it would wither and die. Third: the soil upon which weed seed had been sown. Ground otherwise capable of producing a crop would not yield because of the thickness of thistles and thorns. Fourth and last: the fertile soils which would yield an increase of thirty, sixty, or even an hundredfold.
It is interesting to note that the thorns which spring up in the poor grade of soil to choke the word of God are the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches." In good soil, the teacher sows the seeds of truth with anticipation and enthusiasm, knowing that there will be a harvest; perhaps not the expected harvest, but still thirtyfold if not an hundredfold" (Dr. Carl F. Eyring-Good Tidings to All People). Even Jesus was limited by the soil. Let teachers learn to prepare well the soil.
The Wheat and the Tares
Another of the Master's great parables was the one about the wheat and the tares. (Matt. 13:24-30; 36-43) Here Jesus changes and has the seed represent the children of men. The good seed typifies the honest in heart and the righteous in the kingdom of God, while the tares are the evil minded and those who keep not the commandments of the Lord. The Master's servants wanted to immediately pull them up, but were told it could not be done without great destruction of the precious grain. The disciples were taught a lesson of patience, tolerance, and forbearance. They were assured that a time would come when there would be a separation and the tares would be burned. The time and manner were to be left to the Lord.
The Lord, speaking to Joseph Smith in 1832, referred to this parable (D. & C. 86:4-7). It is suggested that the entire section be read.

The Mustard Seed
The application made in the parable of the mustard seed was entirely in terms, for the children of Israel had long looked forward to the coming in great glory of the Messiah. It startled them to hear its beginning compared with a mustard seed. However, the use of the mustard plant for food was common among the Jews. In Palestine the mustard plant attains a largeness in comparison with time than it does in the northerly climes. The lesson of the parable is relatively easy to learn. "... the seed of truth is vital, living, and capable of such development as to furnish spiritual food and shelter to all who come seeking." The size of the kingdom to be was not to be judged because it had a small beginning.

The Leaven
The parable of the leaven is quoted frequently. It is easily understood. Like the one last considered, it typifies the vitality and inherent power to grow. Yeast diffuses itself throughout a lifeless lump and changes the flour to a buoyant mass of dough. The truths of the gospel have the power within themselves when understood, to leaven the whole lump of humanity. Both the leaven in the flour and the spread of truth are sometimes slow in action but they work quietly and effectively.

A. Perry Picture Hofmann
CHRIST TEACHING FROM A BOAT

While the leaven symbolizes truth, it must be remembered that the same thing, in different aspects, may be used to represent evil. Evil power may also permeate or "leaven" the whole lump.

The Hidden Treasure
The parable of the hidden treasure is recorded only by Matthew (13:44). The critic has often said that it was not honest for the finder to conceal the discovery of the treasure from the owner of the field. We may be assured that Jesus would not commend a dishonest act. The finder followed the Jewish law and all that was done was in accordance with the law of the day. Let us remember, also, that in the parabolic teaching of the day, little attention was given to what might be called the trappings, or outward forms. Certainly no one would, or did consider these trappings as an integral part of the story.

The happy man who found the treasure sold all he possessed and gave up everything gladly in order that he might purchase the field. The Master taught by this illustration that when once the treasure of the kingdom is found, the finder should lose no time nor shrink from any sacrifice needful to insure his title thereto.

The Pearl of Great Price
The parable of the pearl of great price should be carefully studied (Matt. 13:45-46). Of course, the pearl is used to represent great value. The merchant was seeking goodly pearls.
RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE SEPTEMBER 1948

When he found one which excelled all others, he sacrificed all he had to obtain it; it was the pearl of great price. The pearl represents truth. When it is found, no price is too great for its possession. No one can truly become a citizen of the kingdom who is unwilling to surrender all for that citizenship. "The amount each person must pay depends on how much is 'his all.' That only is a sufficient price."

Latter-day Saints have a great heritage. Their pioneer forebears gave their all for the "pearl of great prices."

The Gospel Net
Dr. John A. Widtsoe, in his book The Gospel Net, gives pathos and meaning to the parable of the same name. The gospel of the kingdom has been preached in many lands. It has gathered into its folds good and bad people, mostly good. Often the sorting does not take place until the people have gathered in Zion, and it may not be completely done there. The great "Fisher of Men" will make the final sorting eventually. The just and the unjust will be separated, and each given a reward according to merit.

Questions and Suggestions for Discussion
1. State why you think Jesus was a great teacher. From what source did he draw his great examples to illustrate his teaching?
2. Relate the parable of the sower and tell why it is sometimes called the parable of the soil.
3. Describe the parable of the wheat and the tares. What was the lesson taught by it?
4. If a copy of the book The Gospel Net is available, have someone tell briefly the story of the conversion of the mother of Dr. John A. Widtsoe.

Visiting Teachers Messages
Our Savior Speaks Lesson 3 "Inasmuch as Ye Have Done It Unto One of the Least of These My Brethren, Ye Have Done It unto Me"
Elder H. Wayne Driggs

For Tuesday, December 7, 1948
Objective: To reaffirm what constitutes the true spirit of giving.

Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger and ye took me in: Naked and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me (Matt. 25:34-40).

In essence, is thought of as being temporal rather than spiritual. Most of us are earth-drawn throughout the majority of our living days. We seek learning, work, position, and favor among our fellow men. In our struggle to attain these, we find passing satisfaction in the material things of the world. But there are greater things than these which make the material gains of life of secondary importance. The important values are the joys of the spirit. These come from the perfect service of feeding the Master's sheep.

It is said by modern teachers that if someone holds a grudge against you, and you can get that person to do you a favor, his enmity will disappear for we cannot dislike one to whom we do good. Is it not true that one reason for the love of parents for their children is that they minister lovingly to the needs of their offspring? How then can we demonstrate our love for our Savior whom we cannot meet face to face? By obeying the first great commandment and the second which is like unto it: by loving our neighbors as ourselves. Then we shall better understand that the Lord who so loved each of us that he suffered death that we might live, accepts the service we give any of our brethren as being given to him.

What a great opportunity our Church affords us to give such service through accepting calls to work in any capacity. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).

Work Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 3 Making Women's Wear from Men's Wear Jean Ridges Jennings

For Tuesday, December 14, 1948

N most cases the wool used in men's suits, if it is of good quality, is far sturdier and more durable than that available in stores for women's clothing. Even after it has been discarded as shabby or worn out, the average man's suit offers unusual opportunities for making-over, because of the excellence of its texture and quality. The worn parts are usually found in places where they can be ignored when making over the man's suit into one for a woman. Such parts as sleeve edges, plackets, trouser seat, and cuffs can all be cut away without interfering with a woman's suit. When making a man's suit over into a street suit for yourself, it is usually necessary to shorten the sleeves, which does away with the worn part, and it is unnecessary to use the upper part of the trousers which eliminates those worn parts. The legs of the trousers are turned upside down to make the skirt, bringing any weak spots toward the hem and also allowing a little flare at the bottom. Fit the coat to your proportions. Make the shoulders narrower with a center dart tapered to the bustline in front. Narrow the neckline at the center back seams of coat and collar. Adjust the hip and waistline with a dart taken from the coat hem to under the bust, being sure it is in line with the shoulder dart. The side seams can be fitted as needed according to the lines of the figure. Sleeves can be taken in as needed, tapering them to match the underarm seams and the armhole. Shorten as necessary.

Using the upper part of the trousers for the bottom, make a four-gored skirt. The new longer length can be obtained by making a fitted yoke for the top of the skirt from the unused top of the trousers or from the vest. When the man's suit is too faded or shabby to use on the right side, tip the suit to pieces, clean and remake using the wrong side of the fabric for the right side of your suit. The entire suit will need to be recut, using a commercial pattern.

On most women the pockets in a man's coat come rather low. If they are patch pockets, they can be raised. If bound or flap pockets, a patch pocket can be set over them at a higher more becoming level. An attractive lady's suit can be made by cutting the coat short to just below the waistline thus avoiding the pockets entirely. For this model the collar can be eliminated and a plain fitted neckline used instead. If the suit is striped, many clever effects can be devised as trimming by reversing the stripes in bands, pockets, yokes, etc.

Last, but not least, the man's coat could be easily made into a bolero.

*Literature—*literature of the Latter-day Saints
Literature of the Gospel Restoration
Lesson 3—Gospel Messages from the Book of Mormon
Elder Howard R. Driggs
For Tuesday, December 21, 1948
MAIN emphasis is given in the Book of Mormon to the "things of God." As a result, in every book of this scripture will be found awe-coined, principles of the gospel impressively and plainly stated, and prophetic literature of soul-stirring quality. All of these spiritual expressions are in accord with the Bible, whose divine lessons of life are amplified and clarified by this other "Book of Books."
Our readers may recall that in the study of the Bible from the literary viewpoint, we dealt with what Dr. Moulton calls Wisdom Literature. The book of "Proverbs" is made up of such literature—sayings of practical worth and uplift, pointing the way of righteousness. In the Book of Mormon, there is no such book. Bringing together the bits of wisdom, but similar gems of distinctive literary quality are to be found in many of the chapters of the book. Following are examples of these treasures of wisdom:
Yes, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things (1 Nephi 11:22).
The guilty taketh the truth to be hard; for it cutteth them to the very center (1 Nephi 16:2).
Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy (2 Nephi 2:25).
See that ye have faith, hope and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works (Alma 7:24).
This is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and is my joy (Alma 29:9).
Do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?—do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week? (Alma 32:10).
Blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble (Alma 32:16).
Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek (Ether 12:26).
For the eternal purposes of the Lord shall go on, until all his promises shall be fulfilled (Mormon 5:22).
I love little children with a perfect love, and they are all alike and partakers of salvation (Moroni 8:17).
We have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness (Mormon 9:6).
Many, as they read these gems of spiritual thought, will recall others they have found in the Book of Mormon. A search for such treasures will bring true riches. What may be found of appeal to each one who seeks, will be more deeply impressed if the choice saying is written and kept in a little book of reference. This practice is commended.
Vitality will also be given to this search for precious lines if the gems are studied in their settings. For example, after the soul-testings

For example: For all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever (Jacob 3:2). Whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil (Alma 5:40). In the moving story that Alma the younger tells to his son Helaman, of his being redeemed from sin and turned to the joy of active goodness, we have an effective example of stirring literature. Writes Alma: And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul. And.... While I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.... When I thought this, I could remember my pains no more.... Yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!: Yea, and from that time... I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost (Alma 36:16 ff.). 643 Joseph Wm.

Certainly in the Book of Mormon there is a wealth of Wisdom Literature of practical, sterling worth. Added to this there are many places where the prophets of long ago days on our American continent made plain the divine principles of the gospel. As a striking example take the masterful interpretation of the resurrection and the restoration by the prophet Alma, as recorded in chapters 40 and 41 of the book of Alma, or from the same book in chapter 42, the exposition of justice and mercy. This represents really great religious literature. It is worth reading and re-reading; indeed one must read it often grow up with it, to grasp its deep import. A few concluding paragraphs from these splendid chapters will serve here to illustrate the profound thought, the high literary quality of the whole portrayal of divine truth: But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice. For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus none but the truly penitent are saved... Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds. If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God. Only a few hints of the richness of the gospel messages, with some suggestions of their distinctive literary quality, their sincerity and clarity in revealing saving truths could be given in this brief lesson. Brought forth with divine help by the Prophet of these latter days, The Book of Mormon contains a wealth of reference: Book of Mormon. Each member of the class should provide her/himself 1.

Caution: In making any of the foregoing studies keep attention not alone on the doctrine but also upon the effective expression of the principles of life and salvation so well portrayed. The Book of Mormon while in consonance with the Old and the New Testament in the presentation of gospel truth has a distinctive style or way of presenting old truths. This is but natural, because of the different authors who have made the record and it adds to the charm of this "Book of Books." One good way to enhance the appreciation of this "New Witness for Christ" is to have some of its fine passages voiced or read aloud expressively.

From Sar Rosa Lee Lloyd, author of "Learn of Love," says that somewhere during her early education she learned about love and how important it is when writing poetry or fiction or staying married to the same man forever and ever. Rosa Lee began her writing career at the age of seven and even now she has to be careful or her imagination will run away with her. She has won two national story prizes and has sold numerous stories and poems to United States and Canadian national magazines. She was editor of the Year Book at Davis County High School, a member of the Utonian staff at the University of Utah, and she is a past president of the Art Barn board of directors, past president of the Barnacles (story-writing group) and is now the president of the Salt Lake Chapter, League of Utah writers. Mrs. Lloyd and her husband Llewellyn lost their gifted and promising son Tyndale in the recent war.

I should like to take this opportunity to mention the enjoyment I have gained from reading the fine material presented in the Relief Society Magazine. "The Visitors" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) and "'Pankapaw" by Deone R. Sutherland (March 1948) held a particular appeal to me.

It is indeed a pleasure to have work appearing in a Magazine which consistently publishes real poetry. "Hillside Grain Field' by Eva Willes Wangsgaard is delightful.

I appreciate the fine material contained in the Relief Society Magazine and look forward to receiving it each month.

I especially like the editorial "Of Fathers and daughters" (June 1948) for my father was very dear to me. And I like the photos and art work of the Magazine.

Carol Read Flake, author of "Sudden Storm," tells us: 'Words cannot express the joy with which I received notice of the acceptance of my story. I am humbly happy that my first story is to appear in the publication of my own beloved Relief Society. During my mission to the Eastern States (1935-37) I served for a time as mission Relief Society secretary under Sister Don B. Colton. I am the mother of five children, four sons and one daughter. The oldest is eight and the youngest is one. I shall be happy when I can be regularly engaged in Church work, but I hope to have more children girls!

I have received letters from people as widely separated as California and New Jersey referring to my recent article ("For Makers of Rhythmic Beauty," June 1948). One lady in the East wanted to start to work immediately on a course of work under me, but I had to tell her I was not teaching a correspondence course in the subject at this time.
You are putting out a very attractive and helpful Magazine. Warmest wishes for your continued success.

Anna S. D. Johnson, author of "The Seventh Handcart Company," published in the July issue of the Magazine, has been requested by many readers to furnish a list of the five couples married aboard ship. Here is the list:
C. C. A. Christensen and Eliza Haarby; C. C. N. Dorius and Ellen Gurinda Rolfson; J. F. F. Dorius and Karen Frandson; Lauritz Larson and Anne M. Thompson; Jacob Bastian and Gertrude Pederson.

"Some young people said regarding my story 'Questing Lights,'" writes Belle Watson Anderson, "that they thought everyone who came over on the trek was an old or tired person. 'How lovely to find they were young people, just like we are, with our problems."
