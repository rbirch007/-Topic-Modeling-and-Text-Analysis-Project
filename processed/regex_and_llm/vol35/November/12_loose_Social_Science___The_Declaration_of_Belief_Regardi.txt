The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General" Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, February 22, 1949 Note: A lesson is outlined for Tuesday, February 22, 1949 since some Relief Societies hold their meetings on days other than Tuesday. It is suggested that Relief Societies which meet on Tuesdays present the February 22 social science lesson on March 22 and the March 22 lesson on the fifth Tuesday, March 29, or combine the February and March social science lessons and present them together on March 22. EVAN JENSEN ECTION 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants, "A Declaration of Belief regarding Governments and Laws in General," is the work of Oliver Cowdery, "the Second Elder" of the Church in the new dispensation (Progress of Man, page 367). Objective: To study section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants as the belief of Latter-day Saints in regard to earthly governments and laws in general. The Latter-day Saint doctrine of divine authority to build a real kingdom of God on earth occasioned persecution and conflict. 'The memories of the American revolution of 1776 were still fresh in the American mind, and the American revolution had been a revolt in which the idea of divine authority in secular affairs had been repudiated. The views of the English philosopher, John Locke (1632-1704) had become very popular in the United States. In 1690 Locke had published Two Treatises on Civil Government. The first treatise was an attack on and an utter repudiation of a work written earlier by Robert Filmer, entitled Patriarcha, which contended that God ordained true government with Adam, and that priestly power to rule, or divine authority, had descended from Adam on down to the British monarchy. Devastating this argument in the first treatise, Locke's second treatise contended for popular representative government and the natural rights of man to "life, liberty, and property." Now came along Joseph Smith with a doctrine misunderstood as being similar to the odious one (in the American mind) of Filmer, with the Prophet and the Latter-day Saint Priesthood substituted (in the American mind) for the British monarch of "divine right." Joseph Smith's reconciliation of divine authority to build "the kingdom" was subsequently developed in terms of the doctrine of the divinely inspired Constitution. At a special general conference on August 17, 1835, following the approval by those assembled of the revelations to be included in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, Oliver Cowdery read an article written by himself on "Governments and Laws in General"... "which was accepted and adopted and ordered to be printed in said book" (D. H. C. II, page 247) now known as section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Why? As the printed book still states, in order "that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood..." Significance of the Declaration The Declaration regarding governments and laws is most significant. In the first place, it occupies an official position in the covenants of the Church, moved, seconded, and adopted in open meeting by the people of the Church themselves, upon the initiative of one of its members.

Not designated as a direct revelation from God, the Declaration recommended itself to the friends and enemies of the Church as a democratic statement of belief which could not be derided as emanating from outside, extramundane sources. But more RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE NOVEMBER 1948 important, in order "that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood," the Declaration may be considered the direct ancestor of the very important 12th Article of Faith, which has made it possible for missionaries to preach "the kingdom" in foreign countries without being subject to the charge that they were subversive in undermining support by their people of foreign governments: We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. Can a man divide his allegiance between kingdom-building and divine authority in a gospel embracing "all truth," with citizenship in the American, British, or any other nation? 'This was the problem. And, from the beginning, it was charged that a Latter-day Saint could not remain a good Latter-day Saint and be a loyal citizen at the same time. The "Declaration of Belief," adopted by the voice of the people August 17, 1835, is one of the first and best answers to this question and, as such, presents some of the interesting contributions Latter-day Saint experience has made to political thought. Implicit in the Declaration is the theory that both Church and State were "instituted of God for the benefit of man." When to this is added the doctrine of the inspired Constitution, a unique theory of Church-State relations (suggested in lesson three) is furnished. In general there are two theories of the proper relation of Church and State, typified by two of the great reformers who had to meet the question head-on, Luther and Calvin. In Luther's theory, the Church is subordinate to the State. In Calvin's view, the State should subordinate itself to the Church. American experience, commencing with Roger Williams, has urged the doctrine of separation of Church and State. But when separated, what is their relationship? The Latter-day Saint attitude and experience suggests the answer: their relationship is co-ordinate. Both are responsible, or should be, to God; and both are responsible to the people in building a great world society in which liberty and toleration can prevail. By this means God's kingdom can be built and, although Latter-day Saint doctrine suggests that eventually everyone will acknowledge Christ, yet everyone will have his liberty— even, said Brigham Young, "to worshipping a red dog." In case of conflict between Church and State as they pursue their twin, co-ordinate missions, the 8th section of the Doctrine and Covenants indicates (as does the Declaration) that conflicts should be reconciled by reference to that law "which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges..." This implication of co-ordinate roles and responsibilities for Church and State may be also stated as a broad social, as well as political, theory, deriving from the fundamental "facts" of (a) God's existence and (b) man's existence. Thus, all social institutions bear the same responsibility, in Latter-day Saint doctrine, as Church and State—to make a better world and assist in bringing to pass "the eternal life of man." The Declaration, of course, 783 suggests answers to the two fundamental questions of political theory (1) the nature of the State, and (2) the nature of man. The State is limited by the rights of men: We do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public and private devotion...(D. & C. 98:4). In return for the liberty granted men, and which the good State must respect, men on their part, it is explained: Are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments;... And that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience (D. & C. 98:5). This is one of the great documents of human, political experience. Full analysis of the entire Declaration will be made, step by step, point by point, in a series of lessons to follow the present survey. It is a great and significant landmark in the literature of Latter-day Saint political thought and should be read again and again. Its concluding verse (12) has significance for the "mission of America," shared by Church and State, and for world affairs: We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world... As starved, cold Europeans in destroyed cities survey their task; as civil strife rages in humanity-filled Asia; as all people survey the chasm between Communist totalitarianism and the chance afforded men to earn temporal salvation by means of God-granted liberty, we may fortify our minds with the political doctrines "adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835" (D. & C., 1921 edition, page 250). Questions for Discussion 1. In the early days of the Church it was often claimed that Latter-day Saints believed that civil government was unimportant. Church history on every page disproves this misunderstanding. In this connection, what is the especial significance of the Declaration: of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in general? The Twelfth Article of Faith? Joseph Smith's teachings concerning the United States Constitution? What experiences can the class suggest as to whether or not Latter-day Saints make good citizens? What are the two general theories of Church-State relations that have had wide acceptance in the western world? If Church and State are in conflict, is a Latter-day Saint required to choose which he should support, or does modern revelation suggest a happier solution? What is that solution? How does Latter-day Saint political theory point an important method whereby any such conflicts may be avoided? Read verses 1 and 12 of the Declaration, separately, to the class. Discuss each in the light of the foregoing lessons.

The Three are One:
Geo. A. Smith
Willard Richards
Jedediah M. Grant
John W. Young
Daniel Hanmer Wells
George A. Smith

At the October conference of 1868, George A. Smith was sustained as first counselor to President Brigham Young, succeeding Heber C. Kimball. This selection brought to the First Presidency a man of unusual ability who had already proved his worth to the Church, and whose remaining seven years were to be given to supervisory functions in the Church.

George A. Smith was born in Potsdam, New York, on June 26, 1817. He was a son of John Smith and a first cousin of Joseph the Prophet. All of his family were Congregationalists but young George could not see that this form of Christianity agreed with the scriptures, so he remained aloof from all formally organized religious bodies.

About 1830 he heard of the Book of Mormon through his uncle, Joseph Smith, Sr., who visited his home. He was convinced that it was of divine origin and two years later, in September 1832, was baptized. Moving to Ohio, he was soon sent out as a missionary and until the exodus to the West, spent much of his time engaged in missionary work, traveling extensively in the eastern part of the United States.

He faithfully kept a diary and in it is recorded the vast amount of preaching he did. Before 1870 he had delivered 3800 gospel discourses.

After the migration into the Great Basin, Elder Smith became an outstanding pioneer leader. He was a robust man of unbounded energy and soon engaged in many activities that were necessary for the establishment of the new Zion. He led the colony that established Parowan in 1851 to establish the iron industry, and assisted in the general settlement of the southern part of the Territory.

He has appropriately been called the "Father of the Southern Settlements." So affectionately was he regarded in that area that the city of St. George was named in his honor.

Politically, he served as a territorial delegate to Congress at Washington, D.C., and assisted in forming the Provisional State of Deseret. He was a member of the territorial legislature in every session between 1850 and 1870, with the exception of one year spent in Congress.

LESSON DEPARTMENT John W. Young

When George A. Smith departed this life, the vacancy in the Presidency was filled by John W. Young, a son of Brigham Young.

This young man was born at Nauvoo in 1844 and was ordained an apostle by his father in 1864, but never became a member of the Council of the Twelve. He was interested in industrial pursuits, particularly in the construction and maintenance of railroads which in this era were beginning to enter the West.

In 1866 the plans for a railroad to the Pacific, with its possible arterial branches serving the intermountain territory, made it apparent that a new era was about to dawn upon the Church that would end the saints' economic, religious, and social isolation. The Church leaders planned branch roads to serve the various settlements, and were in need of competent advice.

Brigham Young chose his son John as a special counselor to him in this capacity in the late sixties, and in 1875 set him apart as his first counselor. He functioned in this capacity until his father's death in August 1877, after which for several years he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles.

He later moved to New York City where he engaged in railroad management.

Willard Richards

As Brigham Young was assisted by three first counselors during his administration, he similarly had the assistance of three second counselors. The first of these was Willard Richards, who was born in Massachusetts on June 24, 1804. His family were Congregationalists but Willard never formally joined any church.

He became a successful practicing physician and in the summer of 1835 saw a copy of the Book of Mormon which Brigham Young had left with his cousin near Boston. Willard read a portion of it and declared, "God or the devil has had a hand in that book, for man never wrote it."

He journeyed to Kirtland the next year and, in December 1836, was baptized. He accompanied Heber C. Kimball to open the British Mission in 1837 and remained there as one of its presidency until 1841, having the unique distinction of having been ordained an apostle in England in 1840.

At Nauvoo he was one of the outstanding men in its public life, holding the office of temple recorder, clerk of the Church, private secretary to Joseph Smith, clerk of the town council and clerk of the municipal court. He was with the Prophet in Carthage Jail when he was martyred.

Brigham Young chose him as his second counselor in December, 1847 and in that capacity he became the member of the Presidency who assumed much of the clerical and financial phases of Church administration. It was a great change from the calling of a New England physician to the duties he assumed in Salt Lake City. He was Secretary of State in the Provisional State of Deseret; a member of the territorial legislature; postmaster of Salt Lake City; manager of the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company; general Church Historian; and proprietor and editor of the Deseret News, the first newspaper in the intermountain area, which he established in 1850. His premature death in 1854 brought to a close a career that had.

Under the inspiration of God, given Brigham Young valuable help in organizing and administering the great migration of the saints to the West, and their organization into permanent groups to build the kingdom of Jedediah M. Grant.

The man whom Brigham Young selected to succeed Willard Richards was Jedediah M. Grant, a man very unlike his predecessor in office. Fi. Der Grant was born in Windsor, New York, February 21, 1816, and had joined the Church in 1833. During his early years in the Church he spent most of his time in missionary work and gained a reputation as a great gospel preacher and an unusually able scriptorian. He it was who opened the Southern States Mission of the Church.

In October 1847, he arrived in Salt Lake Valley. When the city was incorporated he was elected its first mayor, which position he continued to hold until his death. He was also a member of the territorial legislature. At the April conference in 1854, he was ordained an apostle and sustained as the second counselor to Brigham Young. For the next two and a half years his energies were spent in promoting what is commonly called "The Reformation." The saints had become so engrossed in their struggle to wrest their sustenance from the parched earth that some had seemed to forget that it was their religion that had been the cause of their going into the West. President Grant literally wore himself out physically, through his strenuous efforts to get the people to see the vital values in life. As a result of his efforts, there was a universal revival of spiritual life and energy, such as the saints had never before witnessed in the Church.

This calling of the people to repentance had a lasting effect upon the Church membership and resulted in a renewed interest in missionary work to the nations of the world. His early death—forty years of age—probably resulted from overwork in this cause. Coupled with his vigor and uncompromising battle against slothfulness and "backsliding" as he termed it, Jedediah M. Grant had a compassion for all who suffered. He died at Salt Lake City on December 1, 1856, nine days after the birth of his son, Heber J. Grant, who became the seventh President of the Church.

Daniel Hanmer Wells The third of Brigham Young's second counselors, was Daniel Hanmer Wells, who was born in Trenton, New York, October 27, 1814. In 1833 he had moved to Commerce (later Nauvoo), where he was a large landholder and prominent in civic affairs. He dealt kindly with the saints who had been driven from Missouri, and although not a member of the Church, was treated as one of their number and was elected to the office of town councilman and appointed a brigadier-general in the Nauvoo Legion. When the saints were forced to leave Nauvoo he decided to cast his lot with them, although had he remained he undoubtedly would have become wealthy from the spoils of their labors. His baptism took place in Nauvoo in 1846. He arrived in Utah in 1848.

There he became active in the territorial militia, taking part in the campaigns against the Indians with marked success, and carrying to a successful conclusion the "bloodless war" with Johnston's Army in 1857 and 1858. On being ordained an apostle and set apart as second counselor to Brigham Young, January 4, 1857, he took over the supervision of public works, an essential portion of the economy of the Church, which provided employment for the immigrants during the adjustment period between their arrival in the Valley and the beginning of their agricultural or manufacturing pursuits. He likewise visited the many settlements of the saints and in 1876 visited the newly founded colonies of saints in Arizona, giving them counsel and inspirational advice.

The death of Brigham Young released him from his office, but he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles. In this capacity he served as president of the European Missions and ended his days as president of the Manti temple. He died March 24, 1891.

Topics for Discussion 1.

What evidence can you present to show that God inspired Brigham Young to choose his counselors because the Church had need for the talents they possessed? 

2. What evidence can you find that these men grew, under the power of their calling, to meet the needs of the Church and its members?

3. What do you suppose caused Willard Richards to make the remark he did about the Book of Mormon when he first commenced to read it?

4. How do you account for the fact that so many of the early Church leaders were converted to the restored gospel by the Book of Mormon, even before they had seen Joseph Smith?

5. Read the two accounts of Jedediah M. Grant's preaching in the Southern States, as given on pages 59 and 60 of 791 Jenson's L.D.S. Biographical Encyclopedia.

You may be interested to know that I visited several of the families that I have been sending the Magazine to. They are all non-members, and each one praised the Magazine very highly, saying they passed it on to friends and relatives when they had finished reading it. It was the means of a good many interesting gospel conversations.
Una McDonald, Las Vegas, Nevada.

"The Visitors" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) is a fascinating story. It reveals unusual ability to portray human behavior patterns truthfully and entertainingly. To my delight I find no flaws in her portrayals, no confusion of traits, not one tiny slip out of character, and I knew intimately the two dear women she describes so charmingly.
I predict for Mrs. Tarlock a brilliant career in the realm of homey stories.
