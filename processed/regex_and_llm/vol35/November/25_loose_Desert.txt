desert at night, they said, and we could sleep comfortably at Flagstaff. "Flagstaff is such a long way," I protested. "It will take us all night to get there." "It is just a four or five-hour drive," declared our eldest. "We can be there before midnight." Knowing from past experience he could outargue me, and also that he was generally right, I found my place in the back seat of the car. We drove through the beautiful meadows of the Kaibab just as the sun was shedding its last rays. On one side of the road we could see deer and cattle grazing together, and on the other, a stately stag posing on a cliff, as if for a picture. Then, as my husband took my hand, I knew that he, as well as I, was seeing this scene twice—now, and as it looked twenty-four years ago when he brought me, his bride, to this lovely spot for our honeymoon. The mountains and pastures looked just the same. The deer and cattle together could have been an identical picture. But on that turn of the road where one white-tailed doe bounded lightly into the forest we remembered a band of twenty-five bucks.

We had surprised dozens of the delicate little creatures who had given us startled glances and darted away. Either not so many deer, I thought, or they keep hidden better. And I looked in vain for the whitetailed, black squirrels which I remembered were formerly everywhere. The moon was coming up as we left the great forest and started down the historic hill to the desert. Twenty-four years ago we would not have dared cross it at such an hour. Then, we had looked down upon the same scenes—the interminable range of low, red mountains so symbolic of this country, with the only landmark in all those endless desert miles a low rock house at the foot of the hill. My thoughts traveled backward.... Leigh and I started down that rocky trail which (nearly a quarter of a century ago) served for a road. We saw a car near the rock house and two men, probably a quarter of a mile away, climbing toward us. As they came closer they hailed us, and we looked to our water supply, for we thought they would surely need a drink. But as THEN—AND NOW

We approached them they waved a small canteen at us and swore mildly.

"Wouldn't you know it—just a couple of kids! Where on earth are you heading for?"

"Flagstaff, and on to Phoenix."

"Flagstaff!" One of them sat weakly on the tuning board while the other cried, "Take a fool's advice and turn back. You will never make it." They told us their story. They had been stuck in the sand, time after time, and had dug themselves out with their bare and blistered hands. They had been four days crossing the desert, and when they reached the rock house they had had to abandon their car because their gasoline supply was exhausted. We talked to them a few minutes, but assured them we were going on. They refused our offer of water and continued their climb, shaking their heads, while we jolted down over the sharp rocks of the old wagon road.

This was not the first time we had been discouraged. The day before, a few miles out of Kanab, we had partially broken a spring. The owner of a combined livery stable and garage sold us a used one, but when we told him we intended to cross Lee's Ferry he was surprised.

"Why didn't you go by way of California?" he asked. "You'll never make it this way."

We explained that we had intended going another route. In fact, we had been in Yellowstone Park the previous week, and before we dared start for the Pacific Coast we had telegraphed for advice on getting into Arizona from California. Our answer had been to avoid California 755 as Arizona had a quarantine against California cars in June of 1924 because of a raging epidemic of hoof and mouth disease. Cars had been held up at the bridges for weeks, and there was no relief in sight, so we had decided to try Lee's Ferry.

Our adviser was still pessimistic. He said we would get stuck in the sand, that he had taken a party to the Ferry just a few days before, and that he charged fifty dollars for the trip, but after these people had seen the road they had given him one hundred dollars. But we couldn't afford even fifty dollars. It had taken practically every cent we had to spare to buy that spring for the car.

We weren't afraid, but we hated to appear too self-confident, so we left him, saying we would go on to the canyon and decide what to do then. There was no hotel at the north rim in 1924, so we camped out. The business of the canyon seemed to be centered in a big, log store and post office. Just after dark we walked toward it.

Coming through the windows we heard strange and unearthly sounds of music, accompanied by weird shrieks and wails. Curiously, and a little frightened, we pushed our way into the big room and watched a man engaged in one of the favorite pastimes of the day—working the dial of a home-built radio and trying to find every station he could reach. It was my first encounter with a radio!

Leigh talked to some of the men gathered there. When they learned we were planning to go across Lee's Ferry, they looked at us in amazement. I don't recall that they actually told us not to try to 756 go, but one after another started telling some pretty tall stories, or so they sounded to me.

I can picture one of the men now, long and lean, wearing high-heeled boots and Stetson hat and faded overalls. He waved his hand toward the great chasm and pointed out some dim and flickering lights from the blackness beyond.

"See those lights?" he said. "Well, last summer an old party came here late in the afternoon—him and his wife in a big Packard limousine with a Negro chauffeur. They turned up their noses at our accommodations here but decided to spend the night in one of the cabins. When it was dark enough to see the lights, the man asked where they were coming from, and I told him they were from El 'Tovar, the big hotel on the south rim."

"How far is it across?" he says.

"Thirteen miles," I say.

"He turned to his wife and said, 'Let's go over for dinner and stay there.'"

Well, we all thought he was joking, so we all chipped in and said, "Yes, why don't you? It's an easy drive, only thirteen miles," and so on. We couldn't understand how ignorant a feller could be about distances out here. But when we saw they were actually taking us serious and were putting their bags in the car we changed our tune.

We told him he couldn't drive to the other side that night. It was 135 miles of no roads at all, and he couldn't carry enough gas in that big Packard to get him over there.

Well, this old guy had taken us serious at first, and now for a while he thought we were joking. When he found out we meant it, he got RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948 stubborn and accused us of trying to make them stay in this wild place. We finally persuaded him to fill his tank and take five gallons of gas extra.

But this old boy, he had an awful time. He made it to the Ferry all night, but the next day he ran out of gas. There wasn't a chance of anyone coming along that road who could help him, so he left his wife and the colored man and started to walk. He walked all day, lost in those hot, dry hills, but finally found an Indian camp, and bought some kerosene. It took him all the next day to get back to the car, and another day to get to the Little Colorado, to a filling station.

They had run out of water and were nearly dead when they finally reached El Tovar. He said all he wanted to do was to get out of this forsaken country and he would never come back. He had enough of western scenery to last him all the rest of his life!" All the men laughed and several recalled the circumstances. Others had more stories to tell, but Leigh and I said nothing. The next morning we took a last look at the magnificent gorge and started back through the Kaibab. At Jacob's Lake, Leigh stopped the car and asked, "Which way?" I answered, "Don't be silly. We've got to get home." "Hail, oh, hail to Arizona!" sang my husband as we drove through the wonderful Kaibab Forest to the top of the hill. "Jumping off place," I called it. It was there we had met the two men. We were soon on the desert, trying to follow a poor semblance of a road. It was never too clearly defined. Sometimes we just drove south, but sooner or later we found the trail. The year 1924 was unusually dry, and there wasn't a green plant anywhere. Off in the distance, not far from the rock house, we saw a herd of wild buffalo. They looked weak and disheartened from lack of food and water. We wondered if they would be alive by August.

We were stuck in the sand several times, but Leigh had had foresight enough to bring a shovel. We would put brush under the wheel, dig a little, and the famous pulling power of the old 1917 Dodge would get us out of that hole. Late in the afternoon we knew we were nearing the river, as we could see signs of green, which could be cottonwood trees. Just before we reached the Ferry we came onto a most interesting scene. In one sand area were hundreds of balanced rocks and peculiar formations. Delightedly, we took pictures. Then on a sandstone cliff we saw a carved date—1879.

"Grandfather Noble came over this road about that date, when he moved his family to Arizona," said Leigh.

The ruggedness of the country, the silence and absence of any life made me wonder if we were the first humans to travel this road since! But at the Ferry we were received casually enough. The man who collected our dollar said he ferried a car across every few days, and saw no hardships ahead. It was a thrill to put the car on the historic, old Ferry. I tried to ask questions about the history of the place, but our pilot didn't seem anxious to talk, although he did tell us that a few years before the cable broke and the boat got out of control. I wondered if the passengers had been asking too many questions at the time.

The green cottonwoods and willow trees gave a grateful shade to the hot country. We saw snatches of gardens and fruit trees, but the ferryman's business was to get us across the river, which he did, with dispatch. We climbed "Lee's Backbone," the rocky hill on the south side of the river, about sunset. Leigh recalled his mother's stories about crossing this road as a young girl. Her father had been sent by the Church as a bishop to a small Arizona town, and they had traveled these wearisome desert miles by team and wagon. It took them a month, and one of the nightmare spots of the trip had been the climb up "Lee's Backbone."

We blessed the Dodge for its comparative speed and endurance, and drove on about ten miles, congratulating ourselves on making the terrible journey with so little trouble. Then, as it was beginning to get dark, we made our camp.

In those days there were few road maps, and for some reason, probably because the people who had tried to frighten us had nearly always emphasized the danger of the north side of the Ferry, we thought we were practically to Flagstaff. Because the air was heavily loaded, Leigh threw away our big can of water, and we lay there in that wilderness, listening to the coyotes howling and promised ourselves we would sleep in a hotel the next night.

I suppose it was because we thought we would surely get somewhere soon that made the next day so long. It seemed almost endless. The rocks of the "jumping-off place" hill had cut into our tires and we had to stop and patch one every hour or so. The road wasn't so bad, but it didn't seem to lead any place. Once we came upon some fresh wagon tracks, and followed them twenty miles, only to find that they turned around and came back over the same ruts. Forty miles lost! We put a few rocks in the road to discourage the next traveler from making our mistake, and went on. But our water supply was running low and we bitterly regretted leaving the big can behind.

Late that afternoon we reached the "Little Colorado" trading post. The river was dry, but the store was open. A woman waited on us, and expressed no surprise at seeing us. She allowed us only one canteen of water for ourselves and the car. We decided to drive on, no matter how long it took us, when we heard the now tragically familiar sound of another blowout. In disgust, Leigh pulled off the road. "I can't fix another one tonight," he said wearily. "We will just camp here and go on in the morning."

We put up the cot. There was only a swallow or two of water left in the canteen, and we laughingly made a ceremony of drinking it. Then we lay down to the most fantastic dreams. They were all about water. We were swimming in it, sailing on it, but when we reached for a drink it was gone.

We were awakened from this uneasy slumber by the sound of a car passing us, and we thought we heard someone laugh. We sat up in bed and looked about us. It was barely light, but Leigh recognized the place. We had made our bed in a triangle of grass which marked a junction of three roads—one west to Flagstaff, one east to Albuquerque, and the northern one we had traveled!

I had fallen asleep as my tall son drove swiftly across the same old desert on well-paved roads, and I was awakened by a display of neon signs and flashing lights.

"This is the junction," Reid said. "It will be in Flagstaff in a few minutes."

"The junction!" I cried. "I remember this place. And I'm thirsty!"

Then I smiled, a little embarrassed, even after all these years.

"If there had been a few lights twenty-four years ago we wouldn't have been caught in such a predicament," I explained, mostly to myself. "But what time is it?"

It was just four hours since we had left Jacob's Lake.

"It's too short a time even to realize where we've been," I said.

"Would you rather have it the way it was before?" jibed my youngest.

Would I? Well, I'll have to admit I appreciate all the comfort I can get when I travel these days. But take twenty-four years from my age and give me the same boyish companion, and I would still be thrilled to face the unknown. For if you never get off the paved highway, and can make a month's journey in four hours, where is the excitement, or the fun, or the adventure? 

SEASONING (Continued) 759 Seasoning (Continued from page 743)

"Now, what are you thinking?" Maury demanded.
"Of your father's house."
"Why?"
"PM remembering how small it was, and how there was always room for people—always room for the hungry, the cold, the cast out. - - everyone who needed food and friendship."
She laughed.
"Hard put we were at times to make it go, but that is where my father's thrift was right welcome."
"That's what I mean," he said. "Some people, who have little, have so much. And some, who have much, have nothing at all."
He looked about him.
"Gosh! I have a lot to learn, like how it's not the food that makes Thanksgiving, but the seasonings from the heart."
She nodded.
"Aye, I know."
She looked at the clock.
"You must hurry now. You must not be late for her dinner."
John pursued the last shred of turkey.
"Maury, did I ever tell you that red is my favorite shade of hair?"
She paused, fork in midair.
Tears sprang suddenly upon her glowing cheeks.
"Nay, you didna'.. You really find it fair?" 
"T find it fair," John repeated.

WILD GEESE
Beatrice K. Ekman

Above the marshes and reed-fringed lagoon,
I hear the wild geese honking in their flight;
Bathed in the luster of the hunter's moon,
They dip their wings down trackless lanes of night.
Over the coarse marsh grass pale vapors rise,
On the dark lake a bright moon-path is drawn,
As, faint and faraway, the honking dies
And wild geese merge with moonbeams and are gone.

I WAIT FOR SPRING
Grace Sayre

I shall pause long when autumn's golden flame
Burns in the maple's glory, to its last dim ash.
I cannot bear earth's poignant claim,
Graying to embers in a wintry blast.
The leaves that drift beyond the garden wall
Will rest in golden layers on the sod;
But I must not look back to see them fall.
I pause.... While empty boughs commune with God.
And who am I to gaze on nature's pall?
I wait for spring where autumn's gold is massed,
And by these symbols, know the year has passed.

A Party for You
Sara Mills

HERE'S party blood in your veins. Read one of the old pioneer diaries. It will tell of furniture pushed outside to make room for dancing feet. Any pretext was enough: a visitor, a person about to go visiting, or no pretext at all. Often as not the party lasted through the night to morning chore time. It was these parties that kept gaiety alive in the bleak days.

Now, in far-removed 1948, you have an essential need to keep gaiety nourished. Give at least one party this holiday season. The memory of it will leave a warm glow to help you up the steep, cold ascent of the January and February hills.

We're passing on to you a menu for a party dinner you can engineer single-handed, if need be. The dinner is an easy one, but so good it will set the tempo for a fine, blithe evening.

Roast turkey is the main dish (as cheap as any other in these days). It is abetted by potatoes au gratin in an elegant guise; a salad that can be made the day before, and a fruitcake. This may be the one you made in November, or the mincemeat fruitcake listed on the menu.

For bread, buy clover-leaf rolls and break them in threes for serving. Dress your turkey the night before, down to the last stitch. Also make your salad the day before, and prepare your potatoes. The dinner is self-serving, of course. Because your oven will be turkey occupied in the afternoon, set your potatoes to bake in the casserole the first thing in the morning. Then keep them covered on top of the oven, popping them in the last thing to be re-heated.

For a drink, use your favorite fruit-juice concoction, hot or cold.

MENU

Roast turkey with dressing warm
Potatoes au gratin
Pear jello
Celery with avocado cheese relish
Cranberry sauce
Mincemeat fruitcake
Clover-leaf rolls
Fruit drink

POTATOES AU GRATIN

Potatoes (boiled in skins, approximately one large one to two persons)
Thin cheese sauce (about 1/2 cup of grated American cheese to each pint of thin white sauce)
Bread crumbs (fine and dry)
1 large onion, sliced
Worcestershire sauce
Butter, salt, and pepper

Boil the potatoes in their jackets. When they are cool, slice them in smallish pieces and place them in a large dish. Season with salt and scatter slices of raw onion throughout the potatoes. Cover and leave in a cool place overnight.

Next morning, remove all onion slices. Make a thin white sauce of butter, flour, and milk. Add the seasonings and the grated American cheese. In a large casserole, place alternate layers of potatoes, bread crumbs, and cheese sauce, topping the dish with a thin layer of crumbs. Dust lightly with pepper and dot with butter. Place in a low oven, about 250°, and bake for two hours.

Taste well for seasoning, have plenty of the thin cheese sauce, and bake slowly. You will have a dish of rarely blended flavors.

A PARTY FOR YOU

PEAR JELLO
1 package lime jello
2 cups liquid
1 can or quart bottle of pears
2 small packages cream cheese
1 pinch ginger
1 tbs. Vinegar

Dissolve jello in 1 cup of boiling water and add 1 cup of pear juice. Pour half of the jello, with vinegar added, into a flat pan. Put in ice box. Place remaining jello in bowl and when it is congealed, beat with a rotary egg beater. Cream the cheese smoothly with a fork; add gradually to the beaten jello. Add ginger and pears cut in pieces, and place on top of plain jello. Chill.

For a large party you will need to double this recipe.

AVOCADO CHEESE RELISH

1 cup finely mashed avocado
2 tsp. Lemon juice
4 3/4 cup sieved Roquefort cheese
1 tbs. Thick, sour cream
Dash of Tabasco and Worcestershire sauces
Salt and pepper to taste

Mix all the ingredients well and chill.

Just before serving, place a portion of the relish in celery stalks chilled in ice water.

761

MINCEMEAT FRUITCAKE

2 cup shortening
1 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 cup mincemeat
2 cups flour
2 tsp. Baking powder
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/4 tsp. Each cinnamon and cloves
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup chopped nuts
1/2 cup, chopped, candied fruits

This is a cake you can make with utmost confidence.

Cream the shortening and sugar together.
Add the egg and mincemeat.
Beat well.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cloves.
Add alternately with milk to mincemeat mixture.
Fold in chopped nuts and fruit.

Bake in a greased, paper-lined loaf pan in a 350° oven for 1¼ hours. Serve in thin slices. You may need to double this recipe, also.

At the last minute, while your husband is carving the turkey and you are tending to heating the rolls and potatoes, ask one of your guests to arrange the salad and celery stalks. You can now enjoy the party with unruffled ease.

STAR VALLEY STAKE (WYOMING), BEDFORD WARD
RELIEF SOCIETY HOLDS SUCCESSFUL BAZAAR, December 5, 1947
A dancing party was held in connection with this bazaar, which was planned as a Christmas gift sale and social. It was a very successful occasion and netted over $250 which was contributed toward financing the new ward chapel now being planned. This little organization, having only thirty members, has completed its quota for the Relief Society Building Fund. The organization was assigned $150 and $159 was collected.

The sisters are happy to have an interest in this beautiful building, soon to be built for the women of the Church.

Sister Sharp comments regarding this interesting branch: "A number of years ago a family by the name of Futter heard this wonderful gospel. There were the father, mother, and eight children, five girls and three boys. In a short time they joined the Church and have been faithful members ever since. A few years ago the family moved to Springs and all of them live there now except one daughter who lives in East London. This daughter is interested in Relief Society and is a subscriber to the Magazine. The Springs Branch Relief Society is a family affair—except for Gertrude Stemmett, but she is, with the others, a member of the Relief Society family. The Springs Branch is very wide awake and very ambitious. When they have a bazaar they make a number of lovely things, knit and hand-embroidered, as well as many good things to eat. After doing all this work and making many donations... they buy back their own things."

Among the many helpful projects which this group has sponsored is one which provides a source of income—a Mother's Exchange, to which the sisters contribute good clothing which the members of their families have outgrown. These articles are then sold to people who need them, at minimum prices.

Another project, primarily for the convenience of the members of this society, was the making up, by means of a hectograph, of booklets listing the names and addresses of all the branch members. At a dime apiece, these more than paid for the hectograph.

The group is now at work on menu booklets featuring recipes that can be prepared in advance, so mothers can get to Sunday School. These booklets should pay for the quilting frames ordered recently.

The Practice of Consonants for Better Singing
Florence Jepperson Madsen Member, Relief Society General Board

He who knows how to breathe and how to pronounce, knows well how to sing (Pacchiarotti).

THERE are various approaches to the improvement of word resonance and clarity in speech and song. One of these is to quickly leave the consonant and sustain the vowel. This should be practiced with the following syllables: may, may, may, etc.

Me, me, me; my, my, my; mah, mah, mah; mo, mo, mo, moo, moo, moo.

After practicing these alone combine them, as for example: me, may, mah; my, may, me; mah, mo, moo; me, may, mo; me, may, my, mah, mo, moo, etc.

When moderate facility has been gained in singing the above exercises replace the M with the consonants: B, P, N, L, D, T, W, etc. The L is particularly useful in effecting tongue flexibility.

After sufficient technique has been acquired in vowel and consonant articulation, definite words should be used to apply this skill. With this objective in view, the following list of words should be practiced both in speaking and in singing:

May, Bay, Pay
Maun, Dawn, Pawn
Mayme, Name, Lame
My, By, Lie
Mate, Bate, Date
Might, Bite, Night

Mah, Bah, Paw
Mile, Dial, Tile
Mall, Doll, Ball
Mow, Bow, Doe
Mote, Dote, Note
Mole, Toll, Dole

Me, Be, Lea
Meet, Beet, Neat
Meal, Deal, Peel
Moo, Boo, Too
Moon, Boon, Doon
Mood, Food, Wooed

These groups of three words should be increased to include others—words commencing and ending with different consonants, sustaining the vowels longer and longer. Practice all syllables and words first on one particular pitch, then on different pitches, scale and chordwise.

Sing the exercises in the easy range of the voice and according to definite rhythmical patterns. When three syllables are sung the triplet group may be employed to good advantage and practiced sequentially up and down the scale.

When syllables and words beginning with a single consonant have been learned, attention should be turned to the study of double consonants preceding a vowel, such as the following:

Blay, Blee, Blah, Blow, Bloo
Flay, Flee, Flaw, etc.
Play, Plee, Plah, etc.
Dray, Dree, Drah, etc. (The R is slightly trilled with the tip of the tongue.)

The articulation of consonants, single or double, should be short and distinct, the sustained vowel being the tone.

Clear, flexible speech is a prerequisite to beautiful singing.

Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.

FOLLOWING the events described in our last lesson, Jesus returned for a brief visit to Nazareth. The people there had rejected him once but he was willing to give them another chance. He is always merciful and willing to forgive. He went to the synagogue and they were astonished at the marvelous work he had done. However, the people were looking for a Messiah and rejected him a second time. They said he was the "... Son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and Juda and Simon." His relatives were plain folk. "And they were offended at him."

At Nazareth, Jesus did not accomplish any great work because of lack of faith among the people.

The Twelve Charged and Sent

The work of the ministry needed expanding. Jesus sent forth his apostles on separate missions to preach the gospel. They had been students under the Master for many months; now they were to leave him and commence the work that Page 770 ultimately took them into all parts of the known world.

At first they were to go only to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel." These were to be given the first chance. This was only a temporary restriction. Later they were to go among all nations.

Always they were to preach, "the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

They were given the Priesthood and told to "Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give" (Matt. 10:8). They were to rely upon divine aid for all their needs.

They were not to take money and were not even to take thought of their lives.?

Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? (Matt. 6:25).

All these things were to be provided if they would have faith.

They were told:

But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (Matt. 6:33).

LESSON DEPARTMENT

The apostles were not to give offense. They were sent as sheep among wolves. The Lord would guide them. Jesus said to them: "For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you" (Matt. 10:20).

The Lord well knew that families would be divided and much strife would result when children would be arrayed against parents and neighbor against neighbor. The apostles would be hated and would endure much suffering, but they ought not to expect a life of ease. Their Master had not escaped. If they were faithful, their Father would watch over them. The love of their work must supercede every other thing.

With these important instructions and the knowledge that the Holy Ghost would guide them, they left on their missions. Jesus continued his personal ministry.

The length of time the apostles were gone on their missions is not given. Their labors greatly increased the spread of the gospel of the kingdom. In the meantime, Jesus continued his marvelous work. It is easy to understand how his fame had spread far and wide and was causing much excitement. Herod Antipas had given the order for John the Baptist to be killed, and since his death, he was afraid of the people. He averred that Jesus was the Baptist returned from the tomb.

The Twelve Return

The report of the apostles, when they returned, was very encouraging. They had taken the message wherever they had gone. In each of the cities or towns they had visited, they had preached the gospel of repentance. They had anointed the sick with oil and, by the power of the Priesthood, the afflicted ones had been healed. In fact, they had done mighty works among the people.

After their return, Jesus took the Twelve to the desert for a brief rest, but eager crowds followed them. As the multitude gathered on the hillside whither they had gone, Jesus looked upon the vast throng with pity. He first taught them many things, healed their sick and comforted them.

Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light (Matt. 11:28-30).

Five Thousand Fed in the Desert

The crowd was so interested that evening came on before they realized the passing of time. It was springtime and the people could stay all night, but they had no food.

The disciples urged Jesus to send the people away:
But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. He said, Bring them hither to me. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children (Matt. 14:16-21).

Human knowledge is powerless to explain the miracle. It was done by the power of God. The Creator, however, taught a great lesson against waste. Barley bread and fish contributed the chief diet of the people in that region. The Master had them gather the broken meat and bread and there was much more left than the whole of the original supply. The people soon began to discuss the miracle. This was the Messiah for whom they were looking. He had power to feed them. They started a movement to proclaim him king to reign instead of the unpopular Herod. However, Jesus dismissed the now excited multitude and directed his apostles to leave by boat. Ascending the hill alone he spent most of the night in prayer.

Jesus Walks Upon the Water

The return trip by boat proved to be a memorable journey for the disciples. A storm arose and the small ship toiled heavily in a rough sea. The men could not use the sails and could survive only by holding the vessel by sheer strength. Jesus knew of their plight and came to their rescue by walking on the storm-tossed waters. When the disciples saw him coming, they thought he was a ghost and were frightened.

But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God (Matt. 14:27-33).

This event was a demonstration that faith is a principle of power. It only we could have faith, the Lord would say to our troubled souls, "It is I, be not afraid."

In the Land of Gennesaret

They landed near a place called Gennesaret—one of the beauty spots of that region. From there, they journeyed north to Capernaum. In the towns through which they passed, "the sick were laid in the streets, that the blessing of his passing might fall upon them." In fact, they "besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole" (Matt. 14:36).

In Search of Loaves and Fishes

Jesus soon discovered that the people who had been fed in the desert were seeking him again that they might partake of his bounty. The Lord rebuked them, saying:
. . . Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled (John 6:26).

They wanted to follow one who would feed them.

The Lord then gave some vital instructions:
Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed (John 6:27).

It was hard for them to understand. He urged them to believe in him and obey his gospel. They knew that while Moses led their fathers, the Lord had provided manna. They had seen the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Why could they not believe now in Jehovah? Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus the Christ of the New Testament.

Christ, the Bread of Life
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world (John 6:32-33).
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead . . . if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever . . . (John 6:49, 51).
Once before the Lord had given similar ideas when he spake to the woman of Samaria (John 4:13-15):
Though within the reach of all who diligently strive to gain it, faith is nevertheless a divine gift, and can be obtained only from Christ.
Jesus said, "I am the bread of life." That bread, he stated, was his flesh. "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day" (John 6:54). The symbolism of bread and water is, perhaps, more difficult for us to understand on first reading than it was for the Jews. "The idea of eating, as a metaphor for receiving spiritual benefit, was familiar to Christ's hearers, and was as readily understood as our expressions 'devouring a book,' or 'drinking in instructions.' " 'The ribbis,' . . . laid it down as a rule, that wherever, in Ecclesiastes, allusion was made to food or drink, it meant study of the law, and the practice of good works" (Geikie. Life and Words of Christ, 1, page 184; page 43 textbook). By the symbolism, Jesus taught that we were to believe in him as the literal Son of God and keep his commandments.
However, it must not be overlooked that his doctrine was difficult for the Jews to accept.
Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? (John 6:60).
". . . Doth this offend you? What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?" (John 6:61-62). Surely it was implied that after his death and resurrection he would ascend to his Father. Only through the Holy Ghost can these great truths be known. "It is the spirit that quickeneth.. I From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him" (John 6:63, 66). This evoked the inquiry from Jesus unto the Twelve: "Will ye also go away?" Peter answered with deep conviction: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948 and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God (John 6:67-69).
Though they did not fully understand all the doctrine, "they knew Jesus to be the Christ."
Questions and Suggestions for Discussion,
1. Enumerate the powers that were given to the apostles of Jesus when they were sent forth on their first great missions. Tell also of the duties required of them.
2. Read Matt. 11:28-30 and tell of your own happiness found in the service of the Lord.
3. Give an account of the feeding of the multitude by the Savior.
4. Did the Savior mean it literally when he said, "Ye are the salt of the earth..— Ye are the light of the world," etc.

Lesson 5—Judge Not That Ye Be Not Judged"
Elder H. Wayne Driggs
For Tuesday, February 1, 1949
Objective: To point out that it is not our place to pass judgment on another.
WHEN the Savior gave us the injunction "Judge not, that ye be not judged," he set for his followers a standard which is hard to live up to. This is because it seems natural for all of us, in our finite state, to see the imperfections of our own. Not once, but many times did the Savior teach those who gathered round him that they gave them Later, to the scribes and the Pharisees he made it clear that even they whose office it was to interpret the law, must not condemn the woman taken in sin, for they themselves "Let him who is without sin, cast the first stone," he said. He tells us to substitute mercy for harsh judgment.
Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven (Luke 6:36-37).
Because of our human frailties there will always be flaws in our natures. It is easy to sit in judgment upon another, but it is unjust to do so since we cannot know all the circumstances that may have contributed towards an act. The Savior knew that only God can render a just judgment, for he alone knows the intents of one's heart. Outward appearances and actions may be misunderstood and misconstrued. There is no living man who is all-wise and who can judge the justice of an act from its inception in the mind to its final result.
Albeit the Lord has given to some of his servants, including the bishop of the ward, to be common judges, and to such persons so authorized, gives them wisdom and discernment and inspiration sufficient to qualify them to act in this high place. "Judge not, that ye be not judged" (Matthew 7:1).

Lesson 5—Outmoded Formals
Jean Ridges Jennings
For Tuesday, 'February 15, 1949
PERHAPS the one article in a woman's wardrobe which gives the least value for the money expended is the formal. Often there is no room in the family budget for a mother's formal, and if there is she hesitates to buy one because she feels she won't get enough wear from it.
Formals need not be considered wasteful or extravagant if we extend their usefulness by making them over into attractive articles of clothing after we have grown tired of them as formals or when they have become outmoded. One might even be farsighted enough to plan the new formal with a view to using it later for some other purpose.
For first consideration is the possibility of shortening a formal and either dyeing it or combining it with other material for use as an afternoon or street dress. This, of course is done only if it can be made appropriate to the occasion. Or why not have a dressy negligee or house coat for a feeling of luxury in those few odd moments of leisure lounging? Often, when a fancy housecoat or robe is an extravagance, an old evening gown can be converted into something of this sort that may give much pleasure.
As has been stated many times before, one must always be careful to make sure that the color and type of material in garments that are made over is becoming to the individual who is to wear the garment. In some cases little girl's dresses can be fashioned from old formals.

If the material is dainty in color and launderable, it is especially usable for this purpose. With the current trend for fuller, longer skirts there is a strong fad for ruffled petticoats. Where is a more logical place to turn for the material from which to make one than to old formals? Taffetas, satins, and other slick materials are usually good to use, and any color in the rainbow, or combination of colors is in vogue. From dresses of washable materials and pastel colors, other undergarments can be made both for children and grownups. Use such dresses for slips, panties, and camisoles. Here, again, is a source of material for blouses. The possibilities are almost unlimited. There is no end to the kinds and colors of material from which one could make a blouse. Whether eyelet pique, silk crepe, taffeta, sheer chiffon, or even heavy brocade, most everyone could fit the blouse into her wardrobe for varieties of occasions. And, as a last suggestion, consider the possibility of redecorating a bedroom with ruffles fashioned from the skirt of an old formal. Make a new skirt for the dressing table, a ruffle around the edge of a mirror, fluffy bows for curtain tie-backs. Or you could even disguise a shabby table or makeshift for a table with a full circular flounce falling to the floor that you made from your old dress.

Literature of the Gospel Restoration Lesson 5—Earlier Evangelistic Literature Elder Howard R. Driggs

For Tuesday, February 15, 1949

FERVOR to share the enriched truths of the restored gospel—to radiate its glorious new light—naturally brought some stirring evangelistic literature. Missionaries, as soon as the Church had been organized, were sent forth. Not only did they voice the glad tidings whenever they found folk to listen, but gradually they used pen and press to spread the newly revealed word of God farther and wider. It was all impelled by a desire to share—to keep the good things that had come by giving them to others. Indeed one can keep the gospel bright and beautiful only by sharing it. Zeal to do this vibrates through the writings of those earlier missionaries. It still does in the work of today.

Two things, however, seem to add to the intensity of the early-day earnestness: first, the nearness to the Prophet and to the divine drama of the restoration; second, the testing hardships and bitter persecution that had to be met and overcome. We are brought closer to all this in the Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, one of the outstanding missionaries who lived through those soul-searching, early-day experiences.

With Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and Ziba Peterson, Parley was on the first official mission—this to the Lamanites on the Missouri frontier. A few paragraphs from his Autobiography, a volume of high literary merit, will help make the story live again.

The four elders, after traveling afoot for hundreds of miles, and meeting with outstanding success in converting folk in and around Kirtland, Ohio, finally found themselves in Illinois, where they were halted, "by a dreadful storm of rain and snow, which lasted for a week or more. Although in the midst of strangers," writes Elder Pratt, "we were kindly entertained, found many friends, and preached to large congregations in several neighborhoods."

His story continues:

In the beginning of 1831 we renewed our journey; and passing through St. Louis and St. Charles, we travelled on foot for three hundred miles through vast prairies and through trackless wilds of snow—no beaten road; houses few and far between; and the bleak northwest wind always blowing in our faces with a keenness which would almost take the skin off the face. We travelled for whole days, from morning till night, without a house or fire, wading in snow to the knees at every step. . . . We carried on our backs our changes of clothing, several books, and corn bread and raw pork. We often ate our frozen bread and pork by the way, when the bread would be so frozen that we could not bite or penetrate any part of it but the outside crust (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, chapter VII).

On reaching Independence—gateway town to the untamed West—two of the elders found employment as tailors to help, while Oliver Cowdery and Parley P. Pratt crossed the frontier line and commenced a mission among the Indians. The first night was passed with the Shawnees, then the elders went over the Kansas River to work among the Delawares. There they found the principal chief—"a venerable looking man" held in reverence as "the great-grandfather, or Sachem of ten nations or tribes." The two missionaries were made welcome by this Indian leader; and after he learned, through an interpreter, of their errand, particularly something of the Bible they brought, he called a council. Oliver Cowdery then addressed the red men. His words, as recorded by Elder Pratt, in part, follow:

Thousands of moons ago, when the red men's forefathers dwelt in peace and possessed this whole land, the Great Spirit talked with them, and revealed His law and His will, and much knowledge to their wise men and prophets. This they wrote in a Book; together with their history, and the things which should befall their children in the latter days.

This Book was written on plates of gold, and handed down from father to son for many ages and generations.

It was then that the people prospered, and were strong and mighty; they cultivated the earth; built buildings and cities, and abounded in all good things, as the pale faces now do.

But they became wicked; they killed one another and shed much blood; they killed their prophets . . . and sought to destroy the Book. The Great Spirit became angry, and would speak to them no more ....
This Book, which contained these things, was hid in the earth by Moroni, in a hill called by him, Cumorah ....
In that neighborhood there lived a young man named Joseph Smith, who prayed to the Great Spirit much, in order that he might know the truth; and the Great Spirit sent an angel to him, and told him where this Book was hid by Moroni; and commanded him to go and get it. He accordingly went to the place, and dug in the earth, and found the Book written on gold plates.
But it was written in the language of the forefathers of the red man; therefore this young man, being a pale face, could not understand it; but the angel told him and showed him, and gave him a knowledge of the language and how to interpret the Book. So he interpreted it into the language of the pale faces, and wrote it on paper, and caused it to be printed ....

So we have now come from him, and here is a copy of the Book, which we now present to our red friend, the chief of the Delawares, and which we hope he will cause to be read and known among his tribe; it will do them good.
Observe here, how Oliver Cowdery, with teaching skill, meets the minds of his listeners simply, concretely, and in terms the Indians could understand. This is real literary art. It was in a dramatic setting—worthy of portrayal by a gifted painter.
The response of the Indian chief is likewise picturesque and touching:
We feel truly thankful to our white friends who have come so far, and been at such pains to tell us good news, and especially this new news concerning the Book of our forefathers; it makes us glad in here (placing his hand on his heart).
It is now winter, we are new settlers in this place; the snow is deep, our cattle and horses are dying; our wigwams are poor; we have much to do in the spring—to build houses, and fence and make farms; but we will build a council house, and meet together, and you shall read to us and teach us more concerning the Book of our fathers and the will of the Great Spirit (Ibid., chapter VIII).
These good intentions unfortunately could not be carried out. Rising interest on the part of the Indians in Mormonism brought immediate opposition to missionary work among them. Indian agents, stirred doubtless by sectarian enmity, ordered our elders, with threat of using military force, off the reservation.
The elders left to continue their work for a time around Independence. It is interesting to note that the very same year our Latter-day Saint missionaries were trying to carry the restored gospel to the Indians, 1831, four chieftains from the farther Northwest came down the Missouri River to St. Louis seeking what they called "The White Man's Book of Heaven." Two of these red men died that winter in the frontier city; the other two returned to their people in the wilds, disappointed; they had been given gifts enough, as one of them said, "to make our moccasins heavy," but the light of the gospel they sought had not been given to them. Their people must still "sit in darkness." Had the Latter-day Saint missionaries been permitted to carry forward their work, the desire of the red men for light and truth might at the time have been splendidly gratified.
Although this first mission of our four young elders, so far as the Indians were concerned, was thwarted, there was rich fruitage from it elsewhere. Not alone in Kirtland, where a religious leader, Sidney Rigdon, and practically his whole congregation, joined the Latter-day Saints, but elsewhere along their route, the elders gathered hundreds into the fold. It was the beginning of a great missionary work, leading to the calling of many others into the service of spreading the gospel far and wide.
All of this zeal was inspired by the Prophet, who gave himself untiringly to the labor of love for mankind. His devoted brother Samuel had pioneered the carrying of the gospel into the wider field when he went forth alone to try to sell the Book of Mormon. Though generally rebuffed and unwelcomed on his humble mission, Samuel did place one copy of the Book where it reached Brigham Young, and through him, Heber C. Kimball. A first convert made by Parley P. Pratt was his own brother Orson. Later, in Canada, he also brought John Taylor into the fold. George A. Smith, a cousin to the Prophet and grandfather of our President George Albert Smith, and another leader Wilford Woodruff, were also among the early ones to cast their lot with the Latter-day Saints. These stalwarts in the faith performed, with others, valiant service in carrying the restored gospel to our Nation and the world.
One thing vitally needed to reinforce the missionaries was convincing literature akin to the Epistles of Paul and others of the long ago. The Book of Mormon provided basic scripture of an impelling interest; the growing Doctrine and Covenants gave living revelation for guidance and inspiration mainly of the membership. Other writings to help expound truth and light to an indifferent or scoffing world, were also essential. Experiences in the field brought Parley P. Pratt to a keen realization of this need; and he set to work with zeal to meet it. As a result, in 1837, he produced his stirring little book, Voice of Warning.
This first volume of evangelistic literature by one of the members of our Church not only braced every elder in his work but became a great missionary itself. It was a forceful reply, to begin with, for the scoffers; it met enemies of the Church on their own ground with courage; it portrayed with understanding and eloquence the meaning and message of the restored gospel. In a word, it was and is religious literature of classic quality; it lives and lasts.
Space and time do not permit any extended study here of the Voice of Warning. To get something of a mastery of this outstanding work requires reading and rereading, and in the spirit of the time and setting of its creation; but the reward in spiritual uplift and better understanding of our gospel is richly worth the study. From the viewpoint of this course—the appreciation of our literature—there are also inspirational outcomes to be gained from even a hurried perusal of this remarkable book.
One is impressed first of all with the author's mastery of the Bible. His keen analysis of the Scriptures marks him as a theologian of high attainment. His portrayal of their truths in relation to the restored gospel is of compelling and convincing character. Added to all this, the author's skill to tell a story, to write clear, straight-to-the-mark composition, to create rhythmic sentences, and to lift his message into the concrete with apt words, give literary quality of high order to his work. His prose is poetic; it lends itself to expressive oral reading.
Just a few sentences and paragraphs will serve here for illustration:
One of the greatest obstacles in the way of the spread of truth is the tide of pub-opinion (The Voice of Warning, "American Preface," XII).
Opinion and guess-work in the things of God are worse than useless; facts, well demonstrated, can alone be of service to mankind (Ibid., XVI).
During this thousand years Satan will be bound, and have no power to tempt the children of men. And the earth itself will be delivered from the curse which came by reason of the Fall.

The rough places will become smooth, the barren desert fruitful; the mountains levelled; the valleys exalted; the thorn and thistle shall no more be found, but all the earth shall yield her increase and abundance to constitute any kingdom in heaven or on earth; namely, first, a king; secondly, commissioned officers duly qualified to execute his ordinances and laws; thirdly, a code of laws by which the subjects are governed, and fourthly, subjects who are governed.... In this respect the kingdom of God is like all other kingdoms, whenever we find officers duly commissioned and qualified by the Lord Jesus, together with his ordinances and laws existing in purity, unmixed with any precepts or commandments of men, there the kingdom of God exists, and there His power is manifest, and his blessings are enjoyed as in days of old (Ibid., "The Kingdom of God," pp. 74:75). The Book of Mormon has perhaps been less understood, and more misrepresented, by the world at large than any other publication which has ever appeared (Ibid., "Origin of the American Indians," page 104). Be ye hard-hearted, ye ungodly children of men; your eyes will very soon behold him who was crucified for your sins; then shall ye see that the resurrection of the dead is a reality, something tangible, and that eternity is not a land of shades, nor a world of phantoms, as some suppose (Ibid., "The Resurrection and Restoration," page 166). From this beginning, for which the author gives to God the honor for whatever is praiseworthy in it, and pays tribute also to Joseph Smith for his inspiration and invaluable contributions, our evangelistic literature has continually been enriched through like service from others. Through pen and press we are still getting many worthy contributions to forward the spread of the restored gospel to the ends of the earth. Studies and Activities 1. What is implied by the term evangelistic literature? Cite examples of such literature used to help missionaries today. 2. Compare the various means available today in spreading the gospel with those at the time of Peter and Paul; and also with those when our Church was in its beginnings. 3. What accounts for the striking success of the earlier missionaries, despite limitations, in carrying the restored gospel to our nation and the world? 4. For the teacher: Assign to two members of the class the reading aloud expressively of the following excerpts from The Voice of Warning: a. Prophecy concerning the Savior: "Prophecy Already Fulfilled," chapter 1, beginning page 24 with words "We will now proceed to show" and ending page 25 with words "from the earth." b. As to the Book of Mormon: "Origin of the American Indian," beginning page 65 with words, "The Book of Mormon has" and ending page 66 with "Book of Mormon really is." Note not only the thought of these selections but the literary qualities of the language—clarity, movement, rhythm, word choice. 5. Be prepared, if time permits, to give other brief excerpts from writings of other early-day missionaries of special merit in proclaiming the gospel, or brief stories of the heroic carrying of the message to the world. See the biographies suggested or other like books for such words or incidents. References Autobiography and Voice of Warning by Parley P. Pratt. These for amplifying story of first missionary work, and beginnings of evangelistic literature for the promotion of this great service. A good history of the Church such as Essentials of Church History, by Joseph Fielding Smith; or Comprehensive History of the Church, by B. H. Roberts, will be of help not only in connection with this lesson, but of others in the course. Biographies such as Brigham Young, the Man and His Work, by Preston Nibley, Wilford Woodruff, by Matthias F. Cowley, and like works on our early leaders will also be helpful for human background in these studies. 780 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948 LESSON DEPARTMENT 781 Social Science—Latter-day Saint Political Thought Lesson 4—The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General" Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, February 22, 1949 Note: A lesson is outlined for Tuesday, February 22, 1949 since some Relief Societies hold their meetings on days other than Tuesday. It is suggested that Relief Societies which meet on Tuesdays present the February 22 social science lesson on March 22 and the March 22 lesson on the fifth Tuesday, March 29, or combine the February and March social science lessons and present them together on March 22. EVAN JENSEN ECTION 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants, "A Declaration of Belief regarding Governments and Laws in General," is the work of Oliver Cowdery, "the Second Elder" of the Church in the new dispensation (Progress of Man, page 367). Objective: To study section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants as the belief of Latter-day Saints in regard to earthly governments and laws in general. The Latter-day Saint doctrine of divine authority to build a real kingdom of God on earth occasioned persecution and conflict. 'The memories of the American revolution of 1776 were still fresh in the American mind, and the American revolution had been a revolt in which the idea of divine authority in secular affairs had been repudiated. The views of the English philosopher, John Locke (1632-1704) had become very popular in the United States. In 1690 Locke had published Two Treatises on Civil Government. The first treatise was an attack on and an utter repudiation of a work written earlier by Robert Filmer, entitled Patriarcha, which contended that God ordained true government with Adam, and that priestly power to rule, or divine authority, had descended from Adam on down to the British monarchy. Devastating this argument in the first treatise, Locke's second treatise contended for popular representative government and the natural rights of man to "life, liberty, and property." Now came along Joseph Smith with a doctrine misunderstood as being similar to the odious one (in the American mind) of Filmer, with the Prophet and the Latter-day Saint Priesthood substituted (in the American mind) for the British monarch of "divine right." Joseph Smith's reconciliation of divine authority to build "the kingdom" was subsequently developed in terms of the doctrine of the divinely inspired Constitution. At a special general conference on August 17, 1835, following the approval by those assembled of the revelations to be included in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, Oliver Cowdery read an article written by himself on "Governments and Laws in General"... "which was accepted and adopted and ordered to be printed in said book" (D. H. C. II, page 247) now known as section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Why? As the printed book still states, in order "that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood..." Significance of the Declaration The Declaration regarding governments and laws is most significant. In the first place, it occupies an official position in the covenants of the Church, moved, seconded, and adopted in open meeting by the people of the Church themselves, upon the initiative of one of its members.

Not designated as a direct revelation from God, the Declaration recommended itself to the friends and enemies of the Church as a democratic statement of belief which could not be derided as emanating from outside, extramundane sources. But more RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE NOVEMBER 1948 important, in order "that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood," the Declaration may be considered the direct ancestor of the very important 12th Article of Faith, which has made it possible for missionaries to preach "the kingdom" in foreign countries without being subject to the charge that they were subversive in undermining support by their people of foreign governments: We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. Can a man divide his allegiance between kingdom-building and divine authority in a gospel embracing "all truth," with citizenship in the American, British, or any other nation? 'This was the problem. And, from the beginning, it was charged that a Latter-day Saint could not remain a good Latter-day Saint and be a loyal citizen at the same time. The "Declaration of Belief," adopted by the voice of the people August 17, 1835, is one of the first and best answers to this question and, as such, presents some of the interesting contributions Latter-day Saint experience has made to political thought. Implicit in the Declaration is the theory that both Church and State were "instituted of God for the benefit of man." When to this is added the doctrine of the inspired Constitution, a unique theory of Church-State relations (suggested in lesson three) is furnished. In general there are two theories of the proper relation of Church and State, typified by two of the great reformers who had to meet the question head-on, Luther and Calvin. In Luther's theory, the Church is subordinate to the State. In Calvin's view, the State should subordinate itself to the Church. American experience, commencing with Roger Williams, has urged the doctrine of separation of Church and State. But when separated, what is their relationship? The Latter-day Saint attitude and experience suggests the answer: their relationship is co-ordinate. Both are responsible, or should be, to God; and both are responsible to the people in building a great world society in which liberty and toleration can prevail. By this means God's kingdom can be built and, although Latter-day Saint doctrine suggests that eventually everyone will acknowledge Christ, yet everyone will have his liberty— even, said Brigham Young, "to worshipping a red dog." In case of conflict between Church and State as they pursue their twin, co-ordinate missions, the 8th section of the Doctrine and Covenants indicates (as does the Declaration) that conflicts should be reconciled by reference to that law "which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges..." This implication of co-ordinate roles and responsibilities for Church and State may be also stated as a broad social, as well as political, theory, deriving from the fundamental "facts" of (a) God's existence and (b) man's existence. Thus, all social institutions bear the same responsibility, in Latter-day Saint doctrine, as Church and State—to make a better world and assist in bringing to pass "the eternal life of man." The Declaration, of course, 783 suggests answers to the two fundamental questions of political theory (1) the nature of the State, and (2) the nature of man. The State is limited by the rights of men: We do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public and private devotion...(D. & C. 98:4). In return for the liberty granted men, and which the good State must respect, men on their part, it is explained: Are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments;... And that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience (D. & C. 98:5). This is one of the great documents of human, political experience. Full analysis of the entire Declaration will be made, step by step, point by point, in a series of lessons to follow the present survey. It is a great and significant landmark in the literature of Latter-day Saint political thought and should be read again and again. Its concluding verse (12) has significance for the "mission of America," shared by Church and State, and for world affairs: We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world... As starved, cold Europeans in destroyed cities survey their task; as civil strife rages in humanity-filled Asia; as all people survey the chasm between Communist totalitarianism and the chance afforded men to earn temporal salvation by means of God-granted liberty, we may fortify our minds with the political doctrines "adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835" (D. & C., 1921 edition, page 250). Questions for Discussion 1. In the early days of the Church it was often claimed that Latter-day Saints believed that civil government was unimportant. Church history on every page disproves this misunderstanding. In this connection, what is the especial significance of the Declaration: of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in general? The Twelfth Article of Faith? Joseph Smith's teachings concerning the United States Constitution? What experiences can the class suggest as to whether or not Latter-day Saints make good citizens? What are the two general theories of Church-State relations that have had wide acceptance in the western world? If Church and State are in conflict, is a Latter-day Saint required to choose which he should support, or does modern revelation suggest a happier solution? What is that solution? How does Latter-day Saint political theory point an important method whereby any such conflicts may be avoided? Read verses 1 and 12 of the Declaration, separately, to the class. Discuss each in the light of the foregoing lessons.

The Three are One:
Geo. A. Smith
Willard Richards
Jedediah M. Grant
John W. Young
Daniel Hanmer Wells
George A. Smith

At the October conference of 1868, George A. Smith was sustained as first counselor to President Brigham Young, succeeding Heber C. Kimball. This selection brought to the First Presidency a man of unusual ability who had already proved his worth to the Church, and whose remaining seven years were to be given to supervisory functions in the Church.

George A. Smith was born in Potsdam, New York, on June 26, 1817. He was a son of John Smith and a first cousin of Joseph the Prophet. All of his family were Congregationalists but young George could not see that this form of Christianity agreed with the scriptures, so he remained aloof from all formally organized religious bodies.

About 1830 he heard of the Book of Mormon through his uncle, Joseph Smith, Sr., who visited his home. He was convinced that it was of divine origin and two years later, in September 1832, was baptized. Moving to Ohio, he was soon sent out as a missionary and until the exodus to the West, spent much of his time engaged in missionary work, traveling extensively in the eastern part of the United States.

He faithfully kept a diary and in it is recorded the vast amount of preaching he did. Before 1870 he had delivered 3800 gospel discourses.

After the migration into the Great Basin, Elder Smith became an outstanding pioneer leader. He was a robust man of unbounded energy and soon engaged in many activities that were necessary for the establishment of the new Zion. He led the colony that established Parowan in 1851 to establish the iron industry, and assisted in the general settlement of the southern part of the Territory.

He has appropriately been called the "Father of the Southern Settlements." So affectionately was he regarded in that area that the city of St. George was named in his honor.

Politically, he served as a territorial delegate to Congress at Washington, D.C., and assisted in forming the Provisional State of Deseret. He was a member of the territorial legislature in every session between 1850 and 1870, with the exception of one year spent in Congress.

LESSON DEPARTMENT John W. Young

When George A. Smith departed this life, the vacancy in the Presidency was filled by John W. Young, a son of Brigham Young.

This young man was born at Nauvoo in 1844 and was ordained an apostle by his father in 1864, but never became a member of the Council of the Twelve. He was interested in industrial pursuits, particularly in the construction and maintenance of railroads which in this era were beginning to enter the West.

In 1866 the plans for a railroad to the Pacific, with its possible arterial branches serving the intermountain territory, made it apparent that a new era was about to dawn upon the Church that would end the saints' economic, religious, and social isolation. The Church leaders planned branch roads to serve the various settlements, and were in need of competent advice.

Brigham Young chose his son John as a special counselor to him in this capacity in the late sixties, and in 1875 set him apart as his first counselor. He functioned in this capacity until his father's death in August 1877, after which for several years he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles.

He later moved to New York City where he engaged in railroad management.

Willard Richards

As Brigham Young was assisted by three first counselors during his administration, he similarly had the assistance of three second counselors. The first of these was Willard Richards, who was born in Massachusetts on June 24, 1804. His family were Congregationalists but Willard never formally joined any church.

He became a successful practicing physician and in the summer of 1835 saw a copy of the Book of Mormon which Brigham Young had left with his cousin near Boston. Willard read a portion of it and declared, "God or the devil has had a hand in that book, for man never wrote it."

He journeyed to Kirtland the next year and, in December 1836, was baptized. He accompanied Heber C. Kimball to open the British Mission in 1837 and remained there as one of its presidency until 1841, having the unique distinction of having been ordained an apostle in England in 1840.

At Nauvoo he was one of the outstanding men in its public life, holding the office of temple recorder, clerk of the Church, private secretary to Joseph Smith, clerk of the town council and clerk of the municipal court. He was with the Prophet in Carthage Jail when he was martyred.

Brigham Young chose him as his second counselor in December, 1847 and in that capacity he became the member of the Presidency who assumed much of the clerical and financial phases of Church administration. It was a great change from the calling of a New England physician to the duties he assumed in Salt Lake City. He was Secretary of State in the Provisional State of Deseret; a member of the territorial legislature; postmaster of Salt Lake City; manager of the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company; general Church Historian; and proprietor and editor of the Deseret News, the first newspaper in the intermountain area, which he established in 1850. His premature death in 1854 brought to a close a career that had.

Under the inspiration of God, given Brigham Young valuable help in organizing and administering the great migration of the saints to the West, and their organization into permanent groups to build the kingdom of Jedediah M. Grant.

The man whom Brigham Young selected to succeed Willard Richards was Jedediah M. Grant, a man very unlike his predecessor in office. Fi. Der Grant was born in Windsor, New York, February 21, 1816, and had joined the Church in 1833. During his early years in the Church he spent most of his time in missionary work and gained a reputation as a great gospel preacher and an unusually able scriptorian. He it was who opened the Southern States Mission of the Church.

In October 1847, he arrived in Salt Lake Valley. When the city was incorporated he was elected its first mayor, which position he continued to hold until his death. He was also a member of the territorial legislature. At the April conference in 1854, he was ordained an apostle and sustained as the second counselor to Brigham Young. For the next two and a half years his energies were spent in promoting what is commonly called "The Reformation." The saints had become so engrossed in their struggle to wrest their sustenance from the parched earth that some had seemed to forget that it was their religion that had been the cause of their going into the West. President Grant literally wore himself out physically, through his strenuous efforts to get the people to see the vital values in life. As a result of his efforts, there was a universal revival of spiritual life and energy, such as the saints had never before witnessed in the Church.

This calling of the people to repentance had a lasting effect upon the Church membership and resulted in a renewed interest in missionary work to the nations of the world. His early death—forty years of age—probably resulted from overwork in this cause. Coupled with his vigor and uncompromising battle against slothfulness and "backsliding" as he termed it, Jedediah M. Grant had a compassion for all who suffered. He died at Salt Lake City on December 1, 1856, nine days after the birth of his son, Heber J. Grant, who became the seventh President of the Church.

Daniel Hanmer Wells The third of Brigham Young's second counselors, was Daniel Hanmer Wells, who was born in Trenton, New York, October 27, 1814. In 1833 he had moved to Commerce (later Nauvoo), where he was a large landholder and prominent in civic affairs. He dealt kindly with the saints who had been driven from Missouri, and although not a member of the Church, was treated as one of their number and was elected to the office of town councilman and appointed a brigadier-general in the Nauvoo Legion. When the saints were forced to leave Nauvoo he decided to cast his lot with them, although had he remained he undoubtedly would have become wealthy from the spoils of their labors. His baptism took place in Nauvoo in 1846. He arrived in Utah in 1848.

There he became active in the territorial militia, taking part in the campaigns against the Indians with marked success, and carrying to a successful conclusion the "bloodless war" with Johnston's Army in 1857 and 1858. On being ordained an apostle and set apart as second counselor to Brigham Young, January 4, 1857, he took over the supervision of public works, an essential portion of the economy of the Church, which provided employment for the immigrants during the adjustment period between their arrival in the Valley and the beginning of their agricultural or manufacturing pursuits. He likewise visited the many settlements of the saints and in 1876 visited the newly founded colonies of saints in Arizona, giving them counsel and inspirational advice.

The death of Brigham Young released him from his office, but he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles. In this capacity he served as president of the European Missions and ended his days as president of the Manti temple. He died March 24, 1891.

Topics for Discussion 1.

What evidence can you present to show that God inspired Brigham Young to choose his counselors because the Church had need for the talents they possessed? 

2. What evidence can you find that these men grew, under the power of their calling, to meet the needs of the Church and its members?

3. What do you suppose caused Willard Richards to make the remark he did about the Book of Mormon when he first commenced to read it?

4. How do you account for the fact that so many of the early Church leaders were converted to the restored gospel by the Book of Mormon, even before they had seen Joseph Smith?

5. Read the two accounts of Jedediah M. Grant's preaching in the Southern States, as given on pages 59 and 60 of 791 Jenson's L.D.S. Biographical Encyclopedia.

You may be interested to know that I visited several of the families that I have been sending the Magazine to. They are all non-members, and each one praised the Magazine very highly, saying they passed it on to friends and relatives when they had finished reading it. It was the means of a good many interesting gospel conversations.
Una McDonald, Las Vegas, Nevada.

"The Visitors" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) is a fascinating story. It reveals unusual ability to portray human behavior patterns truthfully and entertainingly. To my delight I find no flaws in her portrayals, no confusion of traits, not one tiny slip out of character, and I knew intimately the two dear women she describes so charmingly.
I predict for Mrs. Tarlock a brilliant career in the realm of homey stories.
