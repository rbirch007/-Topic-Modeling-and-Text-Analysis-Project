REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBMITTAL OF MATERIAL FOR "NOTES FROM THE FIELD"
(All notes and photographs are to be submitted through stake and mission Relief Society presidents).

This section of the Magazine is reserved for narrative reports and pictures of Relief Society activities in the stakes and missions.

Its purpose is threefold: (1) to provide a medium for the exchange of ideas and methods for conducting Relief Society work which have proved successful in some organizations and which may be helpful and stimulating to others; (2) to recognize outstanding or unique accomplishments of Relief Society organizations; (3) to note the progress of Relief Society work in various parts of the world. It is recognized that personal accounts of individuals who have long served Relief Society, or who have otherwise distinguished themselves, are always of great interest, but the space available for "Notes From the Field" is so limited in relation to the number of stakes and missions that it must be reserved for reports on the work of the organization rather than that of individuals. Wards and branches desiring to submit reports for publication in "Notes From the Field" are requested to send them through the stake or mission presidents. It often happens that one or two wards or branches in a stake or mission will send reports on special activities which are being conducted on a stake-wide or mission-wide basis, and, in such instances, it would be to the advantage of the stake or mission to have the report cover the entire activity in the same issue of the Magazine, with all participating wards or branches represented. Reports and photographs should be submitted as promptly as possible after the events described have taken place in order that they may be published while the activities are still of current interest. Where narrative reports are submitted, with or without accompanying photographs, the name of the stake and ward, or mission and branch, should be given together with the title of the activity reported, the date, and other pertinent data, including the name, address, and position of the person making the report. Pictures which are submitted for publication can be used only if they are clear and distinct and will make good cuts for reproduction. Black and white glossy prints reproduce most satisfactorily. Pictures should have the following information written clearly on the back: Name of stake and ward, or mission and branch Title of picture, stating the activity represented or the purpose Date picture was taken Name, address, and position in Relief Society of person submitting the picture Identification of persons in the picture should be made on the reverse side. Names should be given from left to right, written clearly, and spelled correctly. The given names of the women should be used, not their husbands' names (for instance, Sarah D. Erickson, not Mrs. James Erickson). The positions of the executive officers: president, counselors, and secretary-treasurer If the photograph has reference to some particular activity, such as sewing, visiting teaching, etc., the name of the leader and her position should also be listed. Material submitted for "Notes From the Field" should be addressed to the General Secretary-Treasurer of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah.

Regardless of weather, physical handicaps, or the sorrows that have been hers, Sister White has faithfully performed her duties. She is a Gold Star mother of World War II.

FINLAND MISSION, HELSINKI BAZAAR
Left to right: First Counselor Vieno Tyren; Secretary Hellevi Niemi; President Ida Helio; President of Finland Mission Relief Society Mae Matis; Second Counselor Hilma Hellsten.

Sister Mae Matis reports that none of the articles in this bazaar were made from new material and yet each article was beautifully made and will be very serviceable. In commenting upon the activities of our Finnish sisters, President Matis writes: "From this faraway country the sisters of the Relief Society send their choicest greetings.... We now have four active Relief Society groups in Finland, at Helsinki, Turku, Larsmo, and Jacobstad. All the sisters are willing and anxious to do their part and we are looking forward with a great deal of anticipation.

'Two of the groups held bazaars in December. I admired their spirit to even try with so little material to work with. It is impossible to buy material or yarn of any kind here. The sisters unraveled old sweaters, socks, and shawls which had already been made over several times and remade them. They were happy with their efforts and it was a goal for them to work toward."

(Worse, she had forgotten his birthday. She had forgotten everything but this. She looked critically at the paper, and for a moment her heart pounded with pride; but even work socks would have been better than nothing. In quick anger, she started to tear the paper across. No-o. No. This was Starlight. Strangers had lost the stallion, but she had him. He could never run away from her. Run away? She could find the Indian camp. The Indians liked her as she was. They wouldn't expect her to earn money, but she couldn't leave Papa, no matter what.)

THE family was at the supper table when she stumbled into the kitchen, tired and heartsick. Immediately three pairs of eyes were turned toward her. "Was Mrs. Home late getting home?" Marie asked. "I didn't see her in town." "Likely they were at Stangers," Levi said. "I heard they caught Starlight." "See the package Mama sent and Papa likes his hat so well he won't take it off," Marie added.

Gloria wet her lips with her tongue. The hat was wonderful. Papa cocked his head to one side to show off. The fun in his eyes was more than she could stand. "Did you lose your tongue?" Levi demanded, "I know," Marie's voice took on that know-it-all tone. "She has her pencils. You didn't buy Papa a birthday present, did you?"

The old pec'cy pain tightened inside Gloria. Her eyes stung and her heart was broken in two, but she would not let Marie know. "Course, I brought him something." "Where is it? Why don't you give it to him?" They all waited. She kept her eyes away from Papa. If only she had found a horse— if only she had tried to find one, but she hadn't remembered.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�APRIL 1948 "Did you lead him home or did he just follow you?" The defiance in Gloria crumbled fast. Her nostrils flared, but her head was high and her voice steady. "Here he is, Papa." The sudden stillness was horrible. Papa held the paper before him.

He pushed back his hat to get the benefit of the fading light. Marie and Levi were back of him, looking over his shoulder. Gloria waited. If he would scold her she could stand it. "Glory! Glory!" was all he said, and in a frenzy of regret she threw herself into his arms. "I do love you, Papa," she sobbed. "Don't believe her when she says I don't love you. I love you more than all the world." One hand still held the paper to the light, and it was trembling. With the other arm, he drew her close against him. There was a queer note in his voice when he spoke, as if he were laughing and crying at the same time. "Glory, you have killed my pecancy humor. We shall never use the word again." Marie and Levi exchanged glances. This was queer talk, even for Papa. "It is good, isn't it? I mean really - good?" Marie had forgotten her impatience. "I'll bet anyone who has seen Starlight would recognize it," Levi added. 

Papa spoke to all of them. "Some day this sketch will be exhibited as an example of the early work of a famous painter of animals in action. This is the most precious gift a man ever received." Gloria looked into his eyes and THE GIFT knew that something very special had happened to him, and it was her drawing that had done it. Once again that pain swelled and swelled inside her, but it was not pec'cy anymore.

The Basic-Seven Pattern for Nutrition (Continued from page 273)

To thicken soups, add a small amount of flour or cornstarch to cold water in a separate bowl, mix well, then stir into the soup. Use a wooden spoon to blend thoroughly. For gravies and sauces, use the same method but add more thickener as needed.

Whole-wheat cereals and flour, brown, unpolished rice, oats, and other whole-grain products contain the "enrichment and vitamins" nature produced in them. They are more valuable as food and less expensive than synthetically enriched flours and cereals.

Far-sighted home-makers will protect health by including daily in the family diet milk and milk products; fruit and vegetables; meats, fish, cheese, or eggs; cereals, whole-grain or enriched breads; butter, margarine, or other animal and vegetable fats. They will reduce expense by planting gardens and preserving food at home.

With "prudence and thanksgiving," they will gather the harvest in the time of plenty "in the season thereof" and store it for the lean days to come.
