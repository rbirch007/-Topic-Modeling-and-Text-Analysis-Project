h, I've got along without any special attention from him." Janie tried to give her words a light touch. "T can worry along. But," she said with deep conviction, "he wouldn't hate me that night if I had a pretty dress to wear." She felt as if a ton had dropped from her. It was good to have Miss Ardman know. Miss Ardman stopped so suddenly that she almost stumbled into a pool of still brown water. "You're going to be able to get the dress, aren't you Janie?" Her voice was rising. "I told you about it the first day and you promised." "Oh, Ma will make me a dress all right, but Til still be Janie Carlson and the others will be the characters in the play." "I let you into this,' Miss Ardman deliberated, looking ahead, "Tl have to see you through." Hot tears stung Janie's cheeks. They walked together to the big red brick house where Miss Ardman boarded and into her room. It was, Janie thought, a lovely room, with its white ruffled curtains and matching spread. There was a desk with a shelf of books above it. Miss Ardman silently placed her books on the desk and opened the closet door. Slowly she removed a large zippered bag and opened the zipper -and removed a dress from inside. ANIE'S mouth snapped open again. In all her dreams she had never thought of such a dress. It was made of yards and yards of frosty white organdy embroidered in red dots the color of a cluster of shining cherries caught in the red velvet of the tiny waist band. The 37 bodice was close fitting and cut from the shoulders. And there was a filmy plaited bertha to frame the face. Out of the bottom of the bag, Miss Ardman extracted a pair of red satin pumps. For all her naivete, Janie knew this dress would make the others look commonplace. She sat on the floor, tears welling to her eyes. Her face was luminous with rapture as she asked, "I may wear it?" Miss Ardman held the dress out, admiring its swirling folds. "I suppose I'm a fool to let you wear it," she said more to herself than to Janie. Her slender fingers carressed the folds of the skirt. "It's a special dress. I've never worn it. Mother sent it to me because all through college I didn't have a really pretty dress. Lack of money and lack of materials, but now the beautiful materials are back. I was saving it for the May Ball." Janie knew what she meant. The May Ball was the biggest dance of the year in Ronsville. "My fiance, he was a naval officer and now he is a medical student in his last year at the University, is coming," Miss Ardman said in a sudden burst of confidence. "I wanted him to see me in it first. Janie nodded her head solemnly. She also knew that she was the first student to know about the fiance. Miss Ardman smiled down at her serious face. "It will be your Cinderella dress, but midnight will come for you when the curtain falls. Don't forget it!" She placed the dress reverently back into the zippered bag. Janie got to her feet, her face rapt and serious. "I promise," she said. (To be concluded) How to Make a Kapok Quilt Ilean H. Poulson NE of the most attractive () and useful gifts I have ever received was a kapok-filled baby quilt. It was given to me by my husband's mother when our first baby arrived nearly six years ago. Since then we have made three additional quilts of this type. 'They are favorites with our children because they combine attractiveness with unusual softness, warmth, and little weight. — Because of the scarcity of kapok during the war years we were able to made only small quilts. Adults who have used quilts filled with kapok claim that the insulating properties of this material make it equally useful for filling light summer quilts. The following directions indicate the steps necessary to make the quilt. 'The same procedure can be used for a down-filled quilt if you are fortunate enough to possess enough down for the purpose. Secure enough medium weight unbleached muslin or ordinary flour sacks to make a bag as wide as you wish the quilt to be made and twice the desired length. Fold across the center and join the ends, but do not join the sides of the quilt. Machine stitch through the center, lengthwise. Then begin at one end and sew across the quilt at intervals of about eight inches to form two sets of deep pockets. The pockets are then filled with kapok. I use one pound for a large Page 38 crib quilt, less for smaller ones. Divide the kapok evenly among the pockets and sew the sides to prevent the escape of the down-like kapok. The kapok is then distributed evenly throughout each pocket and a row or two of loose basting stitches lengthwise through each pocket will aid in keeping it in place, preventing bunching. Machine stitching, especially if it is very close, reduces the softness of the finished quilt. APOK quilts should not be washed. (Experience was my teacher, and a good one.) They do seem to enjoy frequent outings on the clotheslines to air and sun. Since it is essential that the cover be washed when used for infants, we made outside coverings that were removable and washable. My favorite covering is a colorful patchwork top made of soft, bright percale scraps pieced together with flour sacks that were dyed bright yellow. The lining for this cover was also made from the same bright yellow material. Care must be taken to select only very soft materials for this purpose if the fluffy kapok is to show off to best advantage. The cover and lining are placed with the right sides together and seamed along both sides and one end. Make sure that the quilt and the covering will fit perfectly by using the same measurements for HOW TO MAKE A KAPOK QUILT each. Then turn to the right side and slip the completed covering over the kapok-filled bag. To complete the quilt, after the inner bag is properly fitted within the cover, close the open end of the cover, with small invisible stitches. The quilt is then tied with yarn in the same way that grandmother used to tie the heavy woolen quilts of her day. Quilting or tying this type of quilt too close- 39 ly tends to pack the kapok. Therefore, it should be tied only where necessary to hold the inside bag and the cover in place. It then takes but a moment to snip the ties and remove the cover to launder it. If, after use, the kapok becomes somewhat lumpy it can be fluffed by lightly pulling the lumps apart with the hands. This can easily be done without removing the cover.
