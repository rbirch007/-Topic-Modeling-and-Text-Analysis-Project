strength, and power that come from membership in a great and divinely inspired sisterhood which reaches out to the far corners of the earth and binds together in closest bonds of fellowship women of many lands. This new year the general board extends its sincere love to the more than 100,000 women throughout the world who comprise the Relief Society sisterhood. May the new year bring to each one the opportunities, privileges, and responsibilities that go into making a good life. We extend to you our deep appreciation for the contribution that each has made to the work of Relief Society during the past year. Your responsibilities have been heavy and unusual in nature and many of your tasks arduous. But with a diligence born of faith in the divinity of the work and with the spirit of loving devotion you have magnificently met each assignment, engraving on the history of Relief Society an enviable record of achievement for the year 1948. As we go forward into another year, may the accomplishments of the past year sustain us. May we realize that each duty we have successfully performed and each task we have mastered have left us better qualified to meet whatever lies ahead. As we go forward into another year may we continue strong in faith and in good works. May there emanate from Relief Society women everywhere a love for mankind. May there be a renewed determination to love the Lord and keep his commandments, for in this we most appropriately speak our gratitude for his manifold blessings unto us and we best equip ourselves to enjoy a happy and successful new year., Affectionately, BELLE S. SPAFFORD MARIANNE C. SHARP General Presidency Page 3 The Modern Family and Spirituality Achsa E. Paxman Member, Relief Society General Board OME is the first and most important school in life, and religion should be the foundation of its education. Everything we want ourChurch and community to be, we must begin to teach in the home, our first aim being manhood and womanhood. 'The most powerful and sustaining force in helping us to meet the realities of life is religion. It helps us to face danger, disappointments, and sorrow. Religious faith helps us to put our trust in the Lord and must be acquired early in life and exercised throughout life. It is a great influence and blessing in every Latterday Saint home. A mother is responsible for the atmosphere of the home. If our children are to do their part we must do ours. One of our leaders has said, "I am not afraid of the youth of this Church. What are you parents doing? Are you doing your part in every way?" Unless we are more capable wives and wiser mothers who teach by example the principles of honesty, dependability, and _ righteousness, we have fallen short of our goal in spite of all our accomplishments. As mothers, it doesn't matter, when we die, whether we have scrubbed our floors every day or not, but it does matter whether we have taught our children the Word of Wisdom, Page 4 and family prayers, and whether or not our children have a testimony of the gospel. A few years ago the following suggestions were given by Dr. Wayne B. Hales as helps in family life: 1. Always be an example to your child. 2. Establish confidence among your boys and girls. 3. Establish traditions for your home so strong that nothing can come to break it. Have various days stand out as events in the home. 4. Use the agencies that are available for building character. Morality can be taught as well as arithmetic. The parents who can plant devotion and faith in God in their children have already laid a good foundation for a fine and happy life. 'The value of the blessing on the food and family prayers gives spiritual joy and gratitude in the home. People who pray together do not get very far apart. In our modern Latter-day Saint homes we must teach by example the principles of honesty, dependability, and righteousness. It is the responsibility of the home to teach the three R's: righteous living; reverence; and responsibility. How do we teach righteousness? By righteous living. Reverence? By devotion to prayer and to Church principles and teachings. Responsibility? Each member should be given responsibility. Home work Award Winners Eliza R.
