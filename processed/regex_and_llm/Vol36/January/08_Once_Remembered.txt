children for some time. She rose hastily and went in search of them. They were at the far end of the block, watching a neighbor rake autumn leaves into a burning pile for the delight of his children. There were two of them. They raced around their father, shouting with delight when sparks showered around them. The man caught them and held them wnder each arm, laughing over them, pride in his face. Joanna's children stood shyly back from the blaze, spectators only, taking the new role humbly. "Children," Joanna cried, unaware of the tears scattering from her eyes. "It's time for supper. Did you forget? Let's have a race home." They leaped around her like puppies. "Race! Race! Should we give Sally and Mike a head start?" "Oh, yes. David, you and Penny get way back here. Farther, much farther." Her voice had a queer catch in it, but they didn't seem to notice. 'Now, run!" They sped away from her; leaves whirled up from their feet. She watched their fleeing forms. Penny ran like a doe, fleet and wild, her dark hair streamed behind her. David ran with his head down, his arms close at his sides. Michael laughed when he ran, spurts of laughter, pushed out of his fat body. Sally only pretended to run, not really interested in such a boisterous business. Penny reached the porch first. She straddled the railing, waiting for Joanna. "Look, Mom, the street is pretty now. It gets pretty at night when the houses are hidden." Joanna followed her daughter's 40 eyes. It was true. The houses were hidden by shadows, their windows were cheerful with the bright golden light streaming out of them. The dark night seemed caught in the black, stripped branches of the cottonwoods. Suddenly Joanna shivered. Wiainter was not far off, almost she could hear it, baying on the hills like a gaunt white wolf. She herded the children into the house, sent them to the bathroom to be washed by Penny. She warmed a casserole dish of stewed chicken and noodles, cleared the table and set it with her own preserves, with thick slices of homemade bread and with fresh country butter that one of the women had brought from Brigham. The children sat in their accustomed places. They stared silently at the chair where their father had RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1949 _sat. Their small faces grew sharp. Joanna sat hastily in the vacant chair. She bowed her head. "David, you ask the blessing." They ate hungrily, with the intense enjoyment of healthy children. Joanna watched them, her hands folded in her lap.. Love and fear and loss shook her in turn. Suddenly she could bear it no longer, the smell of hot chicken, the singing of the kettle on the range, the children's lamplit faces. She rose and went to her room. She knelt beside the rocker, her face leaning against the knuckles of her hands. Her breast seemed torn with the whispered cry " rel haven't anyone but thee. I know I have made mistakes, done foolish things Forgive me and help me now, I humbly pray." (To be continued ) ONCE REMEMBERED Wanda Greene Nielson I tried to ease my aching heart, And turned from love away; — I never once remembered you The first monotonous day! I schooled my heart and trained my thoughts So very well! At length I took a stroll down memory's lane, Just to test my strength. Weighted to a burden, Sharpened to a pain, Love with its hurting Is in my heart again. — FROM THE FIELD Margaret C.
