reaching it we will find our own greatest happiness. So let us take that formula for our measuring rod and as the years go by, at intervals let each of us ask himself, have I grown in love this past year? Is it easier for me to love all men, all classes, all nations? Am I as kind in my home and thoughtful as I could be? Can I tell those I love that I do love and appreciate them? Or, is it too much bother? Am I as kind in my judgment as I ought to be? And it seems to me, sisters, this last is a keynote for our happiness, to be kind in our judgment of each other. It is said that we judge other people by their actions; ourselves by Our intentions, and that is not fair, is it? If we were willing to judge other people by their intentions we could never judge, because we cannot possibly know what is in another's heart. One day my little daughter came running into the house and said, "Mother, Joyce says I am spoiled." And I said, "Well, Judy, I have heard you say a dozen times that Joyce is spoiled." She did not answer for a second or two and then she said, "Well, but she is." A fine old English convert moved into one of our wards a few years ago and had been there but a short time when the bishop asked him to take charge of the sacrament table for the following month. He was so thrilled to think that he was worthy, but some of the sisters in the ward went to the bishop and said: "This man is not worthy to handle the sacrament. He smokes." 365 He had been a heavy smoker all of his life but now he had joined the Church and he was trying so hard, and these women did not know what his wife knew. Day after day she would see him out in his garden down upon his knees with the tears streaming down his face, praying for strength to leave the cigarette alone. He had conquered and he was worthy, but they did not know it. When we moved to Salt Lake a number of years ago we lived next door to a sister who held a very high position in the Church, but she did not go to sacrament meeting. She did not go to Relief Society meeting. She did not visit the poor and the needy. She did not do any of the things I thought she should in the position she held. It seemed to me she just rocked on her front porch day after day, and I was quite free in my criticism of her. But I awakened one morning to find that she had died in the night with cancer that I knew nothing about. That is why she could not do the things she wanted to do. So let us be kind in our judgments of each other. EMEMBER this morning in the closing prayer, Sister Cowley implored the Lord that we might guard our tongues. Most of the trouble and unhappiness that come in our association together is because of our unguarded tongues, the unkind things we say. Our pioneer grandmothers had a code. They prayed: "Lord, keep us from pettiness. Help us to be big in thought and word and deed." And it might help us to remember this, that great minds discuss ideals, 366 average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people. I wish we would remember and teach our children that to find happiness we must seek it in a focus outside ourselves, the kindly visit to those im troubl those in distress rather than to seek my own comfort—that must be something that Jesus would have me do, and to speak words of underus today. On the way, because the selfish putsuit of our own plans will guide us away from his path. Look about you. Who are the neurotics among us? Not these sisters on the stand, not our Relief Society officers, Out auxiliary workers, not our bishopric, not out First Presidency. They are too busy serving others to feel sorry for themselves. And men are only great as they are kind, and the more kind the more Christ-like. And I am suré we have no finer example in all the world than our beloved Prophet of today who is with us this afternoon. He is known all over this world as a kindly man who loves the children of his Father in heaven. I do so want to tell a sweet little story about him, and I do not have his permission, put I do have his daughter Fdith's, so maybe President Smith can settle with her. Fdith went to pick him up at his office, on a winter night, and he put on his hat and said he was ready to go. And she said, "Where is yout overcoat?" He said, "I haven't any." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 She said, "Papa, where is your new overcoat?" And he said, "Well, I went out at noon and I met a man on the street who was cold and shivering and did not have a coat and I gave him mine." So Edith wrapped a shawl around him and took him home, and I am sure she must have wrapped it around him with special tenderness that night, thankful for the great heart within her father. So we must let ourselves be touched by the spirit of the Master, that we may speak words of kindness and appreciation to those we meet in the common walks of life. The Master said, "Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God." And the peacemakers are those who, having love and sympathy for men, are always trying to get them to undereach other and to co-operate with their Heavenly Faon earth. There is such an opportunity to serve all about wus, and it is not always enough to do the little things we have to do. The real joy comes in doing the things we do not have to do. | No! Long ago I was riding on a bus down Ninth South. It was _ We got in the middle of a bus driver stopped the bus and got A MEASURING ROD FOR GROWTH out and helped him across, came back and got in and we went on. Not a word was said, but I am sure every heart on that bus was warmed because he did not have to do that httle thing, and I imagine dozens of motorists had whizzed by this blind man and probably thought, poor man, I hope he makes it, but the bus driver did something about it. President Smith has given a definite assignment to Relief Society to spiritualize the homes of t
