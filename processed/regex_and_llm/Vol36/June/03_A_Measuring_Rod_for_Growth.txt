MAGAZINE VOL. 36, NO. 6 JUNE 1949 -. The Cover: '" Sweet ITlemory Dorothy J. Roberts I recall him, true and wise, The lad from long ago who cries A starry beauty back to me Through nbboned lanes of memory. When twinkling pools of rain would hide Their stumbling depths from me, as guide, He steered my elbow in his palm. He poured his simple faith as balm To heal my budding discontent And lit a maiden's wonderment. I never hear him in the dark, Moving now, nor could I mark His lightened footfalls should they pass, Still as shadows over grass Or midnight sparrow under eaves. Yet often when catalpa leaves Are shielding their ethereal bloom, I drift from this dissolving room And walk with him a country lane, A summer evening washed with rain. Talisman Rose," Photograph by Josef Muench. A Measuring Rod for Growth Blanche B. Stoddard Member, Relief Society General Board [Address delivered at the annual general Relief Society conference in the Tabernacle, Thursday afternoon, September 30, 1948.| HIS morning we had a wonderful demonstration of the growth of our building fund which will make possible the realization of a great Relief Society dream. For a moment this afternoon, I would like to speak of a measuring rod for our own individual growth, the following of which may make it possible for us to realize some of our dreams., We have a beautiful song which says: "I know that my Redeemer lives, and because he lives, I, too, shall live again." 'The sacrifice of Jesus has ensured the resurrection. We shall literally live again. But his coming has brought to us another kind of living, a rich, full, abundant living that we do not have to wait to enjoy in some hereafter. Before the tme of Jesus the old Mosaic Law was in effect, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," but Jesus brought us the greater law of love, of tolerance, and forgiveness. He gave us the key for this rich, abundant life, and his gospel is highly practical. It is something that we can put into our daily lives and really live, and it is a strange thing, is it not, that we hold to perfection in obedience to natural law. We just take for granted that if we obey certain laws we get certain results. But we do not always do that in regards to this great law of love. Page 364 For instance, if I want to bake a cake, I must have certain ingredients and certain proportions, and if I skimp or leave out one I do not get a good cake. My husband is a builder. If he wants good concrete he must have cement, sand, and water, and if he leaves out any of these he has not good concrete. If you want to send a special delivery letter you must have a thirteen-cent stamp, a tencent stamp is not enough. If we want a pound we must have sixteen ounces; fourteen will not do. And it is said that one-thousandth of an inch variation in the building of an engine shaft will cause enough friction to ruin it. O, do I fool the oven with short measure recipes? Does my husband fool the sun with short measure concrete? Do we fool the laws of harmony when we play false notes? We fool only ourselves. Then why can we not accept this same procedure in following exactly and completely this great law of love which encompasses all others? Why cannot we take for our formula of life: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," a formula just as exact and scientific as any other? To solve it does not entail great sacrifice or noble and heroic deeds, just the will to live from day to day with A MEASURING ROD FOR GROWTH the happiness of others as our goal, and in
