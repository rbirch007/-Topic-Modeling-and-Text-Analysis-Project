"Ople from think we're §lng to like your city, WE ARE SO BUSY We've never been here before, I mean I haven't. Tom was _ here once when he was a child." "Things have changed a great deal since then," I told her. "I think our biggest changes have come since the war." _We got started on the war then. Mr. Hadfield had been in the navy and since my Bob had been in the navy, too, we had a common interest. From the war we went to economics. It was the subject nearest his heart since he taught it. Mrs. Hadfield added her share to the conversation in a way which indicated that she, also, was educated. They asked me all about the city. Especially they were interested in Temple Square. "Your Tabernacle organ," Mrs. Hadfield asked, "would there be any chance to hear it? I play the organ a little myself, so I'm partial to organ music." I was very happy to tell her about the organ recital every day at noon, "T'll tell you what," I volunteered, "If you like, I'll go with you someday. Maybe I can show you a few things that you might not see if you went alone." "Would you? Oh, I'd love that. Pll be looking forward to it." Both of them invited me to come again soon and I assured them that I would. (CROSSING the yard to our house, I decided that I would try to find a day next week to go to the organ recital with Lucille Hadfield, but I didn't. Very suddenly Margey and Brad decided to get married in July instead of waiting until September. There were so many things 179 for me to attend to, as there always are for a bride's mother no matter how simple the wedding may be The days slipped by. I saw my neighbor quite often during the afternoons sitting in Emily's hammock in the back yard. Always she was just sitting, not reading, not sewing, just sitting. And always I Was surprised, she had impressed me as being so full of energy that I couldn't associate idleness with her. A few times I stopped by the fence and talked to her, and she seemed so interested in whatever I had to say. I apologized for not having had a chance to go to town with her. She was very understanding. "I know all about weddings," she told me. "We had three in the family last summer. Actually we were 4 little tired of them before it was all over." "IT should think so. Well, it's over now and I won't be so busy. Why don't we plan to go to the recital this Wednesday, or maybe you've already gone." "No, I haven't. I'll be looking forward to Wednesday, then." "Good. We can go to lunch af. Ter and make a day of it, if you'd like." But on Tuesday night Dan's sister Beth came in from St. George. It was always nice to have Beth and since she came so seldom I did like to spend the time with her' while she was here. Much as I hated to disappoint Lucille Hadfield, I just couldn't go. "Of course, I understand perfectly," she answered, when I called her. "Don't worry about me, I can go just anytime." "Tm surprised Lucille hasn't become discouraged and gone by her- 180 sclf," I told Beth as I hung up the phone. "She probably has," Beth replied. "I wouldn't be concerned about it She probably goes to town every day, with nothing at all to do. | don't imagine that she is too lonesome." "IT guess not, but I am going to spend an afternoon in town with her before she leaves to go home since I suggested it." It was my turn to entertain my club on the first Thursday in August and I decided to ask Lucille Hadfield to come. Although I had invited her over repeatedly a special invitation would make her know that I was sincere in my efforts to be friendly. "This is Kate Crandall," I said when she answered the phone. "Oh, hello," her voice was sunny. "It's nice to hear from you. "Did you have a nice visit with your sister-in-law?"' "Yes, I did. You see I was teared in the country, too, and she brings me up to date on rural things." "Tm rural-minded, too. Most of the time I find the city rather dull." "Well, it can be. What I called for is to ask you to come to my club on Thursday afternoon if you will, It's here at my house. There are about a dozen of us. It isn't a card club, more of an art club. Sometimes we sew or have a book report. This time we are having a lesson on stencil painting. Have you ever done any?" "No-no, I haven't." "Well, it's simple to learn. ['m going to town tomorrow, and I'l] get the materials you'll need for you if you'd like me to." There was a long pause then. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 When she finally answered I was prepared for her excuse. "Pm so sorry, Mrs. Crandall." Her voice sounded strained and so different from what it usually did. "But I just remembered that I'm meeting 'om tomorrow afternoon. He doesn't have a class and we're going to town." It was a very lame excuse; quite obviously she didn't want to come. I hung up the phone, feeling like I had been slapped. It sounded so unlike her. Maybe, after all, she wasn't interested in being anything but a casual acquaintance. Maybe all of her friendliness was only a
