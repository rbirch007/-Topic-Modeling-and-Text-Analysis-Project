d greetings and your treasures from far places to build this house. Let the door be lighted and may your devotion be to all of us forever a sign upon its threshold. (Tue Door Is LicuTep.) As a lasting door to service— Now lighted by the many hands Who carry far the gospel's gleam, The shining portal stands! (Misston Group Sits Down.) To Zion's daughters long ago A mission was foretold, And we have brought our offerings here As prophesied of old. Eternal builders, now we come, Rejoicing to this place; From out the crested mountain lands And isles beyond the sea, In joy and gratitude we come, In faith and charity. FROM THE SHADOW OF A DREAM TO THE SUNLIGHT OF PROMISE 97 For in this hallowed valley Our stately house shall rise, With strength and love uplifted Beneath the desert skies. The sun shall gild its shining walls And beauty there abide; In welcome to the sisterhood Its doors shall open wide. Then let us come rejoicing— Our treasures now appear In blessings gleaned and gathered Throughout a glorious year! (CounsELor SHarp's Appress. THE PINNACLE Is Licutep As SHE ANNOUNCES THE Goat REACHED.) 'Wearing a Face Into a Mother's"' Caroline Eyring Miner ODAY as the college graduating class filed past the audience, a hand waved frantically in an attempt to attract one of the graduates. It was a mother's work-blunted hand, and as I looked at her more closely, her withered face beaming with pride and happiness, I suddenly knew what Gulbransen meant when he used in one of his books the striking phrase, "wearing a face into a mother's." How does a mother's face get the mother-look of love and pride, and forgiveness, and faith, and trust that we all know? It is worn there day by day as a great painting is made, stroke by stroke. To a fresh, young creature whose face is classicly fair and lovely, a child is born, and with its birth there comes into the fair young face faint lines of a great unselfish love that has borne pain and sorrow for another. In the years that follow there come more children, more cares, more tears, more sacrifices, and the fair young — face wears, line by line, and love-stroke by love-stroke, into the face of a mother. Not all mother faces are weathered and prematurely discolored and wrinkled; those are not the really telling marks of a mother face, but are the signs of a life of struggle on the part of an individual whether she is a mother or not. The lines on a mother's face that make it distinctly a mother's face are those that gather about her mouth when she says, as she has said hundreds of times, "Child, you didn't mean it, and I love you more than life in spite of all." Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, February 1, and 15, 1889 "For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WomMeEN oF Att NATIONS" e TRUTH Thou brightest of all earthly gems, How much I think of thee; Whether in mansions of the great, In wide domain and vast estate: Or in the cottage of the poor, In workman's shop or merchant's store: Upon the land or on the sea, There is nothing ever outshines thee. —Charlotte Cruse Thorpe FAIR AT ST. JOSEPH: There was a very fine display of useful and ornamental articles on exhibition; also quilts, tidies, home-made carpets and rugs, all being worthy of praise. A fine representation of statuary, including a large bust of President Brigham Young, which attracted much attention; also a display of seri-culture, millinery, etc. We had on exhibition the finest of corn raised from the second crop after barley was harvested in July; also turnips weighing seven pounds, both raised by Bishop John Taylor, of Pima, and sweet potatoes weighing eleven pounds, raised by Bro. Frank Owens. Although too late in the season for a display of fruit, there was quite a variety of a supetior quality raised in the valley this year. We have seen peaches measuring from nine to eleven inches, and bunches of grapes weighing from four to five pounds. —W. East, Prest., L. Gustafson; Sec. A PRAYER God of Thy children below, Father, Redeemer and King, Help us Thy hand e'er to know; And in all of the perils of life To cling to Thine Anchor of love, To guide through the billows of strife. —Hope TOOELE STAKE: Minutes of the Relief Society which convened in the Tooele meeting house, Dec. 8th and oth, 1888, Prest. Mary A. Hunter presiding. There were present from Salt Lake City, Sisters Zina D. H. Young and Bathsheba W. Smith. Sister Zina D. H. Young gave some very good and interesting instructions to all, and to mothers especially, and spoke by the Spirit of God. Said, "Mothers have a great work to do and a great mission to fill in raising up their children in a proper manner. Our children who are obedient to the Gospel are a great and shining light, and we should be very careful to set a good example before them, so that they may walk in our footsteps."—Ann Tate, Cor.

BLIZABETH June Barlow, who won the title "Miss Utah" last fall in the talent and beauty contest at the State Fair, is an active Latterday Saint girl, a member of the Tabernacle Choir and a ward chorister. A lovely blonde, with a winning smile, Miss Barlow feels that the training received while fulfilling her Church assignments was an important factor in her winning the crown. Singing is the talent she demonstrated. ISS GENEVIEVE RIVIER, of Lausanne, Switzerland, author and world traveler who is writing a book on America, called attention to a noteworthy situation, while visiting in Salt Lake City. A very high percentage of Swiss families shared what they had—and in many cases it was not a great deal—with one or more refugee children, sometimes over a long period, during the war. They harbored a great many French and Dutch children. @) Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon A student on the University of Utah campus is Miss Leela Ray of Calcutta, India. A young Hindu girl, with an artistic and radiant personality, Miss Ray was sent abroad by her government to master all possible phases of physical education. She has a diploma in physical education and two degrees, bachelor of arts and bachelor of teaching, from her own country. After attending the University of Toronto, in Canada, she came to the University of Utah, where she will receive a master's degree in physical education in March. After visiting other universities, she will go to the Scandinavian countries for special study. She has been invited to represent India at the International Congress on physical education for women in Copenhagen in July. Upon her return to India she will have charge of all the physical education for women in her native province of Bengal. N ancient India the seclusion of women was unknown. From four thousand years ago on, for centuries, Hindu women possessed property, took part in sacrifices and other religious duties, were present at important assemblies on state occasions, influenced politics, and often distinguished themselves in science and other learning of their day.
