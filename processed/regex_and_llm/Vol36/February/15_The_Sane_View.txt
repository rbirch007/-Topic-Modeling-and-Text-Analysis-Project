rable of the lost sheep (Matt. 18:12-14 and Luke 15:1-7). Space will not permit quoting in full. Many people have misunderstood this parable. There was great rejoicing over the finding of the lost sheep as there will be whenever a lost soul is saved. However, the ninetynine had continued joy. They were safe-folded in the Master's keeping. The one was brought back to the fold the others had been enjoying. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in speaking of this parable, said: The hundred sheep represent one hundred Sadducees and Pharisees as though Jesus had said, "If you Sadducees and Pharisees are in the sheepfold, I have no mission for you; I am sent to look up sheep that are lost; and when I have found them, I will back them up and make joy in heaven." This represents hunting after a few individuals, or one poor publican, which the Pharisees and Sadducees despised. (D. H. C. V: 262 and Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 277).

Then he gave the steps to be taken if further adjustments must be made. Extreme measures were to be taken only if a man neglected or refused to obey the decision of the Church. If the offender was finally cut off, he would be "'as an heathen man and a publican." The procedure is the same in the Church today (D. & C. 42:88-93). The Lord's instructions on forgiveness should be studied (Matt. 18: 15-22). These wonderful instructions were made more memorable by giving to the disciples the parable of the unmerciful servant (Matt. 18:23-35). The text on this parable should be carefully read.
