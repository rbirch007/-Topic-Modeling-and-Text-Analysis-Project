st. During his time many pioneer trains, including the vanguard of the Latter-day Saints, began the lonely trek to the mysterious West. But Lincoln never saw the great deserts, the snow-clad Sierras, or the sea waves on the Pacific Coast. He could not have known the strength that would come to the Nation nor the problems of world leadership which would be thrust upon it, but he did know the good way of life; he understood lasting moral principles. Now his name is known to every school child in America and the echo of it has reached beyond our land. The words which the poet Edgar Lee Masters gave to Ann Rutledge might also apply to Lincoln: Bloom forever, O Republic, From the dust of my bosom It has been said of Lincoln that he stood erect by bending over the fallen, that he rose by lifting others. REMEMBRANCE FOR FEBRUARY He was a plain man, with plain virtues—honesty, decision, tenacity, infinite sympathy. He died more tenderly lamented than any ruler in history, but the grief was not wholly for the way he died, but rather for the way he had lived, because of the courageous achievements of his fiftysix years of life. Someone once said, at the end of a walk in spring, "I have grown taller 101 from walking with the trees." So it may be reasoned that all Americans, and people of other lands as well, may grow taller by weaving into the intricate strands of their own lives the words and the wisdom and the high example of the lives of great men, until that time when universal peace shall "'lie like a shaft of light across the land." —V.

Women Against Polio Elaine Whitelaw Director of Women's Activities National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis AST summer's widespread epidemics of infantile paralysis emphasized anew the importance of women in all aspects of polio work. Women always have been leaders in the fight against this disease. Naturally this would be so, since the vast majority of those hit by polio are children, and nothing comes closer to a woman's heart than the well-being of her children —indeed, of all children. But their activities today go further than sympathy and interest. Women are serving in the ranks of those caring for patients, seeking a preventive or cure, organizing communities to meet the needs of epidemic emergencies, and disseminating factual information about infantile paralysis to prevent fear itself from becoming epidemic. Nothing stood out more clearly during 1948, when at least 30,000 new cases of polio were reported for the United States, than the growing influence of women in this work.... Every successful _ volunteer movement owes a substantial part of its development to the tireless energy and enthusiasm of its unpaid women workers. And 1948 proved this to a high degree. More than 12,000 Polio Emergency Volunteers had been trained by them to assist professionals in the bedside care of polio patients in hospitals and homes Many went into polio wards in California, Nebraska, and Texas to help. At Camp Sutton, Page 102 Monroe, N. C., fifty PEVs did all of the non-professional work, so that physical therapists there could devote all their time to muscle training and testing. One of the most serious problems after an epidemic is the follow-up care of patients. Women will play a large part in solving this in North Carolina, for they have arranged to transport patients to hospital outpatient departments and travelling orthopedic clinics run by the State's Crippled Children's Service for regular check-ups and treatments. Many of the country's "forgotten" polio cases of years past already have been given new chances for useful lives— through the efforts of women volunteers who have systematically sought them out for check-ups. CREDIT for increased knowledge of facts about polio and a consequent decrease in panic, so noticeable in 1948, can be placed largely at the door of women's clubs and organizations which have made the public education program of the National Foundation part of the fabric of their health and welfare activities. Women have been outstanding, too, in the National Foundation's research and professional education programs. When Dr. Isabel M. Morgan of Johns Hopkins University reported last July at the First International Poliomyelitis Conference in New York on the successful immunization of monkeys WOMEN AGAINST POLIO against polio, she brought pride to women everywhere. Mrs. Morgan's work, with that of her colleagues, Drs. Howe and Bodian, has shed light on the role of antibodies in protection against the polio virus. While no preventive vaccine can be produced for trials in human beings until all types of polio viruses have been found, classified, and characterized—a project scheduled for the next year's work by several National Foundation supported laboratories— it is believed the Johns Hopkins experiments have provided necessary tools for an ultimate answer to protection of man from attacks of this disease. Of the dozen fields in which fellowships and _ scholarships have been awarded with March of Dimes funds, two-thirds have included women workers The fight against infantile paralySis is a joint activity of both women and men We face three factors that make the 1949 March of Dimes a crucial undertaking: 1. There are more polio patients than ever before. Some of the increase in recent years' totals of reported cases may be due to greater knowledge of 103 polio, prompter hospitalization and better care reporting. Whatever the reason, the rise in actual cases requiring assistance is real. 2. The cost of polio care has risen. Additional professional experts are required for modern care. Medical teams are developing, including, besides the physician and the nurse, the pediatrician, orthopedist, physical therapist, medical social worker, and phychological consultant. | More complete service to patients is possible. 3. The dollar does not go as far as it used to. Hospital costs have risen 10 to 12% since 1947, while the '1948 March of Dimes drive raised less than 4% more than in 1947. March of Dimes money cannot buy as much service, food, supplies, and equipment as in the past. To do the best job of taking care of polio patients, without slowing the now promising search for a solution to the disease or interfering with the training of urgently-needed hospital specialists and research workers, men and women—together —must make the 1949 March of Dimes the most successful in twelve years. The conquest of polio, lying somewhere in the years ahead, can only be achieved by such determined and energetic partnership. — Winter Pear Dorothy J. Roberts What loveliness was felled with this brave tree To leave returning robins fugitive; What grace crashed earthward, what lost melody From branches where a meadow lark would sieve Through a silver throat, the fountain of his song. Upon these boughs each season's beauty lay, In slumber pale, but straight of trunk and strong; Ephemeral in spring's samite array, Here summer lacked no leaf to cool her shade, And autumn burned a riotous color chart. When, after its bright zenith, leaves were grayed, Still amber and vermilion lit the heart, Seeing the winter fruit no limb had lost, Awaiting final favor from the frost. Joanna Margery S. Stewart CHAPTER 2 Synopsis: Joanna, who had married David Niels against the wishes of her family, is left a widow with four children to care for and support. Courageously, she takes inventory of her resources—a home, poorly furnished and not paid for, and $1.19 in cash. OMEONE knocked at the S front door. The children, like a covey of quail, went with her to answer it. It was the neighbor who had built the fire for his children. He was carrying a stuffed flour sack, which he swung down from his shoulders. "It's navy beans. Got a cousin who brought me down a couple of sacks of 'em. He grows 'em. Thought you could use 'em, maybe." Joanna smiled at his flushed, young face. "Thank you. I surely could." He went ahead of her to the kitchen. "Tell me where to put 'em. Don't want to mess your clean house. Behind the stove do?" Joanna nodded. She moved a chair to make room. He cleared his throat. He was young and ruggedly built. Color tan up into his neck. "Anything I can do, Mis' Niels?" Joanna shook her head. "You're right kind to ask, though." When he had gone the children climbed back in their places and resumed their meal. Penny stared at the sack. "I guess we'll get a thousand suppers out of it." David rubbed his stomach. "BosPage 104 ton-baked, with molasses... That's what Daddy liked." Penny buttered her bread. "Daddy said nobody could make Bostonbaked like Mommy. Daddy said she was the best cook in the world." Joanna, standing by the stove, lifted her head. There was a sudden burning in her breast, a roaring in her ears, a breathless reaching for a spar. "Say that again, Penny What your Daddy said... About my cooking." Penny nodded her head vigorously. "He wasn't just kidding either. Every time you make Boston-baked the whole neighborhood walks by just to smell the delicious smell. Mrs. Smith says so. She told me." Hope leaped like flame. In Joanna. She opened the lid of the range and poured more coal into it. She opened the oven door and let the delicious heat surge into the kitchen. Michael's head was nodding. She went to her bedroom and brought out the rocker, sat in it, and held Michael against her. This was the hour David had loved. He had held them cradled in his laughter and his love. She searched her mind, but no story was hidden there. She reached out her arm and Sally cuddled against her. Joanna asked haltingly, "Would you... Like to hear about when I was a little girl?" They shouted their delight. She told the stories carefully, knowing she had no magic of words to make the brooks and the orchards real, to 105 the top of the Stove, 5 0 Cloc | M sleep.

She had beautiful white hair that gave her an air of aristocracy, bringing to Joanna's mind the remembrance of powdered wigs and curtsies and billowing skirts. Her eyes were a bright sparkling brown, her skin was lined, but Joanna loved to look at her, finding her beautiful. Abigail Smith was puffing. "I came through the back way, leaning under that fence always gets me. But I couldn't hold back any longer. I been watching you since crack o' dawn." She eyed the oven door. "What were you puttin' in that oven?" "Beans," Joanna said, laughter a pale ghost in her voice, as she watched her visitor's astonished eyes go from covered dish to cake pan, to half-eaten pie. "It's not for us. Folks brought us enough to last the week." Abigail Smith unwrapped her hands from her apron and came to stand before the range. ""Then who for? What you making a batch o beans that size for?" Joanna measured oatmeal into the boiling water. She avoided her neighbor's eye. "I had a thought... Maybe I could sell them. Folks say they never tasted Boston-baked like mine." "You're the best cook in this ward!" Abigail averred, "Everybody's crazy about your cooking." "Tt's all I know," Joanna said. "Tt it just has to work." Abigail opened the oven door. And sniffed appreciatively. "Well, maybe you can do it. How do you plan to go about it?" Joanna, setting the table, stumbled out her ideas. Bornly. Abigail shook her head. "Maybe you can do it. But, this depression, nobody's making out. Maybe you Should better have saved your beans." "T've got to try it," Joanna cried. "T just can't sit and do nothing." "You can go on relief, like the rest of us." "No." Joanna's mouth set stub- "No." Abigail rolled her hands in her apron. "Well, maybe if I had children, I'd feel like you do. Children make a difference." After a moment's silence, she added: "I'm nght proud of you. Leastways you'll go down fighting." Joanna smiled crookedly, "But you think I'll go down." Abigail turned to the door. "Listen, I have to go now. Henry will be getting up in a minute, but there's no call for you to drag things around in little David's wagon. I'll drive you around in that old Model T' of ours. Youll be able to carry more." Joanna's face flushed in gratitude. "That's nice, right nice of you." Her hand on the door, Abigail paused. "Why don't you make up a batch of your good bread? I'll bake it in my oven. It's got heat in it going to waste. People ought to like that bread of yours." Joanna stirred the oatmeal impatiently. "Tl do that." "You just come any time If I get done with my work I'll come over and help. What do you plan to carry the beans in?" Joanna looked wildly about the kitchen. "I never thought of that." Abigail's smile was smug. "T thought of something myself, just standing here, I thought, now why wonderful," "Smarter than a lot of folks give Me credit for. Door slammed Placent back.

She pulled on stockings, slipped into her good shoes, and stared at herself in the mirror. Her hair! She brushed it behind her ears and forced the short ends into a roll. She stared at herself. Her eyes looked too large and brilliant and anxious. Her mouth was pale. She fumbled for a lipstick, applied it hastily, and rushed back to the kitchen. She called Michael and Sally, got them in and out of the bathroom, and then, with Abigail's help, carried the basket to the back seat of the Car, The fear within her grew larger with every block that brought them nearer to town. All right, she thought, I'm afraid. But I can't let that stop me. I can't Just quit with all the food I've made. I've got to go ahead with it. I've got to try. What more can folks do than say "no?" I've been said "no," to, lots of times. She looked back at Michael and Sally jolting in the back seat, babbling their delight over the ride and the sights. They have no one but me. It just has to go. But when at last Abigail found a parking place before the building that housed the railroad office, Joanna could hardly force her legs out of the car. Abigail was nervous, too. "Now don't feel bad if they don't buy. I'll take good care of the youngsters." Joanna nodded. She lifted jars of beans, loaves of brown and white bread into a picnic basket that already held the paper plates and napkins and spoons that had taken ninety cents of her small hoard. She covered them all with a white linen napkin, and straightened and looked at Abigail. "I'll make out," she said through dry lips. "I'll make out fine." "It's just five minutes to twelve. You'll catch them at a good time." Joanna crossed the sidewalk to the door. The prayer within her had so loud a cry, she wondered that the passersby did not pause to hear please help me. You know I can't do anything without you. You know I'm nothing but a farm gitl, not brought up to do anything but cook and bake. You know about my children.

She waited until they were safely gone before she put on her brown coat and walked aimlesslly towards town. Stopping before the big house of red brick, she peered over the hedge into the living room. There was a side window with a lifted shade. Yes, it was Miss Ardman, still in her brown school dress. She had her hair down in a long bob, looking very young, not like a school teacher at all. She sat there, neither reading nor sewing. When Janie rang the doorbell, Miss Ardman came, her eyes red, as if she had been crying.; "You didn't stay home from the dance because I spoiled things by wearing your dress?" Janie blurted out the words, her voice thick. When they were out she leaned against the door jamb, trembling with relief that she had said them. Miss Ardman pulled her inside the door. "No," she said. ""That's not the reason, although when I first saw you come into the dance, I felt like doing just that." — began to cry. "I didn't mean to break my promise," she said between sobs. "TI felt like I had to wear that dress to the dance or I would die. I guess there's no use telling you how sorry and ashamed I am." "That's the best thing you can do," Miss Ardman told her, wiping Janie's eyes and nose with her own handkerchief. She drew Janie into the living room and sat beside her on the couch.. The tension of the past week cbbed from Janic. "When I looked out there and saw you," she confessed, "I knew what a low thing I had done. You could have shamed me there before everyone and made me hate myself and you. But you didn't. You acted as if you were proud I'd worn your dress." "I had a lot of confidence in you, Jamie. I knew you would tell me about it." The coldness and hardness were gone from Jamie's body, leaving it light and relaxed. Her tears came again, not the wrenching sobs, but easy ones. "'Don't stop me,' she protested. "I'm so happy." She felt clean and good. "I wanted to come to you but I didn't have the courage." "You came at the nght time," her teacher told her. "I was in a low state myself. 'This afternoon when I came home to curl my hair and rest, I got a telephone call from Robert's landlady. She said he had the flu, but that he had been planning to come right up until this afternoon when she put him to bed." She smiled ruefully at Janie. "For awhile I almost thought he wasn't ill. I was so disappointed." The barrier between student and teacher was gone. "Why," Janie cried, shocked into speech, "teachers are human, just like anyone else!" She laughed with Miss Ardman. Clasping her hands over her knees, she confided, "I wanted to go to this dance so bad my skin hurt. But I wasn't going with Don Betger and no one else asked me." Avoiding Miss Ardman's surprisdd look, she said, "After I wore the dress I knew I could never go with him again." "Then the week of misery was worth it," Miss Ardman said gently. "You can do better things than go with Don." THE DRESS Janie's stifled yearnings and resentments stirred within her. "I want to do better things, but I don't know how." She looked down at her hands while Miss Ardman stared at the carpet. Suddenly she jumped up, facing Janie. "There's just one thing for you to do," she said with determination. Everything had been hopeless for so long, Janie felt none of her teachers enthusiasm. "What is it?" she asked, not moving. Miss Ardman became a school teacher again. "Ordinarily," she said in her clear, precise voice, "I don't think that a college education is the sum total of life. People can be just as happy, just as useful—that is, some people. But for you, Janie, I think it is the quickest and. Best way." Janie slumped against the sofa. "T've got about as much chance of going to college as you have of being queen of England," she said. Miss Ardman's eyes were bright with zeal. She sat by Janie's side, her voice as sharp as a new blade. "Td like to know why you can't go to college. No," she commanded, lifting her hand. "Don't tell me! I know all the answers you have and there isn't one that's valid! All I want to know is, does it mean enough to you to go?" "Of course I want to go, but how can a girl like me do it?" "That's the whole trouble, a girl like you!" Miss Ardman snapped off each word and thrust it scornfully at Janie. ""What's wrong with a girl like you? You feel sorry for yourself. It isn't because you are poor. It's because you think you are. 113 That's what's holding you back! Don't you know, Janie," she ejaculated, "poverty is no disgrace! It's just an inconvenience. All we have to do is get rid of the inconvenience.". "I know," Janie acknowledged. "T ought to get away from Ronsville long enough to show people I can do something. Here I'm just Janie Carlson in an old brown coat." "That's why college is. The best way for you. It will polish those rough edges and open the way to a new life—for you and for your family." Miss Ardman was on her feet now, pulling Janie with her. "It's easy, really," she said as they went upstairs. Inside her room she pulled out a last year's blue linen dress. Obediently Janie put it on and sat in front of the mirror while Miss Ardman arranged her hair. "Now smile," Miss Ardman said, "as if you expected people to like you." "Could I be like that always?" Janie asked as the two girls watched her face in the mirror. ISS Ardman had an answer. "I have friends who would be downright glad to have you live with them. You could help with the dishes and stay with the children when necessary. On Saturdays and Sundays they would pay you extra to give you spending money. I'll write tomorrow, but I know we can call it settled." "There's tuition and books," Janie reminded her. "Let me think," Miss Ardman replied, tightening her lips. "I believe we can manage that too. There are scholarships to help girls like you. If we go about it the right way, I'm 114 sure we can get one. All you need now is money for clothes." She gave Janie's cheek a triumphant pat. "I do baby sitting, but it doesn't pay much in Ronsville. People have too many relatives." "A pretty girl like you,' Miss Ardman deliberated, a critical look in her eyes, "shouldn't have trouble getting higher paid work." She gave Janie a thorough inspection from her curling bob to her pumps with the run-over heels. Her mouth still tight, she went into her closet again and emerged with a pair of saddle leather sandals, almost new and a fleecy white jacket, slightly worn at the cuffs, but personable. "Now we'll go to the drugstore," She decided. "Ernie Todd owes me something for all the money I've spent there when I've been lonely for home. He told me he was going to put a new girl at the fountain as soon as the tourist business picks up. We'll save him the trouble of looking for one." Then her eyes caught the old coat. "Let's say goodbye to 'brownie' forever," she declared rolling the coat into a tight bundle. "Qh, no," Janie protested, reaching for the bundle, "Ma can make a coat out of it for one of the kids." "Nobody's going to wear this coat again," Miss Ardman said positively. "We'll find a better one." She gave the bundle a decisive throw, landing it in the waste paper basket. Janie felt a little cool in the fleecy jacket, but light as if her feet had wings. She sniffed the air with its RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 promise of flowers. It smells just like I feel, she thought. "There will be times, Janie, lots of times when you will be all alone in this thing. Will you have the fortitude for it?" Janie threw back her head, feeling a surge of strength through her body. It was the strength of a person who suddenly understands him- ~ self. She thought of John Rons. He did not seem so important tonight. Soon she could meet him on his own grounds. There would be other boys, boys who might mean more to her than John. "You haven't answered my question, Janie?" Miss Ardman tightened her hold on Janie's arm. Janie did not slacken her pace. The strength was still there, flowing steadily. "I don't know how to tell you," she finally answered in a voice new in its maturity. "That morning you read the cast of the play—the morning I was late as usual—you made me a little angry and ashamed by reading to me. I thought you were just picking on me, but I kept remembering the words. Now maybe I understand what you were trying to tell me. From this night on I'm going to say to myself, 'I'm rising to do the work of a human being.' When I'm alone I'm going to remember those words and that you had confidence in me about the dress." Miss Ardman said nothing, but Janie could see the satisfied look on her face as they turned under the neon light and went into the drugstore. >> Margaret C.

In describing this interesting trip over the high mountains of Arizona, Sister Brinton writes: "'As you probably know the Pine Ward is located about 120 miles from Mesa. It isn't the distance—but the road—and what a road! We were anxious to attend the conference, but when we thought of those winding, mountainous roads, the trip didn't seem nearly so interesting. Brother Rial Randall who is "airminded" came to our aid. He said he would make arrangements for those who wanted to fly to make. The trip. This was done and in the party there were eighteen.... What a delightful trip! The conference in itself was an inspiration, and at noontime there was a demonstration of Western hospitality. All the Pine Ward members met in the park for a barbecue luncheon.. Such a feast they served!" Page 115 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 Photograph submitted by Mabel A.

Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 24, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, May 3, 1949 Objective: To follow the Savior in his final preparation for the supreme sacrifice and show how he prepared his apostles for their great missions. Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ. HATEVER transpired during the transfiguration, it is evident that Jesus knew when he came down from the holy mountain that he must prepare for the consummation of his earthly ministry. He had received the transcendent assurance that his Father was well pleased. He had felt again the glory of heaven and had conversed with two of his own "divinely-appointed ministers." To his pure soul it must have been disturbing to know that he must go back for a time to unbelieving and wicked people and finally descend into the "valley of humiliation and death." With sublime courage he faced the ordeal. Healing of a Youthful Maniac At the foot of the mountain he found his other apostles and a multitude of people. One of the multitude had a sorely afflicted son. This man knelt at the feet of the Savior and said: Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not (Mark g:17-18). The failure of the disciples to heal the afflicted youth had brought upon them criticism. 'The unbelieving scribes had ridiculed the disciples and, indeed, had cast doubt on the | authority of Jesus himself. However, when Jesus appeared the same scribes remained silent. Of course, this lack of faith and consequent lack of power among his chosen and ordained servants pained the Lord and he chided them:... O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour (Matt. 17:17- 18). Page 123 A Perry Picture From a painting by Hofmann CHRIST BLESSING LITTLE CHILDREN Py LESSON DEPARTMENT — In chapter 9 of Mark a more extended account of this miracle is given. 'The boy was evidently not in a condition to exercise faith in his own behalf. In reply to the man's earest request, "If thou canst do anything," which really implied doubt, Jesus stated, "If thou canst believe; all things are possible to him that believeth." The man cried out: "Lord, I believe." In the miracle just considered, the afflicted youth was permanently cured. Jesus had charged the demon to "enter no more into him." The apostles, while on their missions, had cast out devils but were unable to do so in this case. They were distarbed and asked the Lord, "Why could not we cast him out?" Jesus answered, "Because of your unbelief." However, he added, "Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting." 'This lesson given by Jesus teaches so well that faith is a power, but that faith must be firm, genuine, and pure. The Lord's Death and Resurrection Again Predicted From the place where the last described miracle was wrought, Jesus and the apostles started toward Capernaum. Hechosea less frequented toad that he might have opportunity to instruct the twelve. They had received a testimony that he was the Christ, but he wanted them to know of his approaching death and resurtection. 'This, they were slow to comprehend. On one occasion he said, "Let these sayings sink down into your ears " (Luke 9:44). Then he proceeded to explain that he would be killed and would "rise the third day." Luke says, "But they understood not this saying, and 125 it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying" (Luke 9:45). They seemed not to-want to believe because the very thought was so terrifying to them. The Tribute Money Supplied by a Miracle Soon after Jesus and his followers reached Capernaum, a tax collector approached Peter and asked, "Doth not your Master pay tribute?" The inquiry related to the temple tax which had been required of the Jewish male adults since the days of Moses. The question was not put to Jesus, probably because of respect or awe which was felt for him. Priests and rabbis were usually excused from paying this tax. It was a small tax, amounting to half a shekel or thirty-three cents in United States money. It was a Jewish contribution and not a tax levied by the Roman government. As Peter was about to submit the matter to the Master, the latter forestalled him by asking of Peter, "What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? Of their own children, or of strangers? Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free." The meaning was apparent—Jesus was the Son of God. The temple was the House of God. It was inconsistent to ask the Son to contribute to his own Father's house. Peter had already pledged payment without consulting Jesus. 'The Master, however, relieved any embarrassment on the part of Peter by saying, "Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast 126 % RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 SARERTA, a Hermon _ DAMASCUS, ¢ F s » et ge ao + € f Fen 4 on f a oe _— te.

Bible students tell us that the "piece of money" is designated by the more literal translation "stater," a silver coin equivalent to a shekel, the exact amount of the tax for two persons. The miracle is inexplainable, except on the assumption that Jesus made the earth, sea, and all things therein. It is incomprehensible to man's finite mind. The miracle is without parallel. Jesus performed no miracles for personal gain. 'This one was wrought for Peter and to avoid giving offense. His questions to Peter clearly showed that Jesus, by reason of being a King's Son, need not have paid the tax but voluntarily did so to avoid any seeming violation of the law and for the sake of his chief apostle. As a Little Child On the way to Capernaum a dis- LESSON DEPARTMENT pute arose among the apostles as to who would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 'They believed Jesus was both the Messiah and temporal king. The apostles were arguing as to which would hold the important positions in the coming kingdom. They finally met with Jesus in a house at Capernaum and the question was submitted to him. The Lord knew the thoughts in their minds and, wanting to teach them a lesson on true greatness, took a little child tenderly in his arms and said: Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me (Matt. 18:3-5). He taught also that little children are typical of the kingdom of heaven. Jesus wanted his apostles to learn true humility. 'They were men of courage and force and he did not want them to become childish but childlike. Following the lesson on humility he repeated some of the precious truths given in the great Sermon on the Mount, and gave them instructions on several vital subjects. They were to avoid giving offense, to overcome evil desires and tendencies at any cost. If they committed evil, their consciences would be an unquenchable fire within them. Every human soul must be tested. We are tried in the "fiery furnace" that the dross may be removed from the gold. Amputate any member of the body which gives offense. "For every one shall be salted with fire, and every 127 sacrifice shall be salted with salt" (Mark 9:49). "The soul must receive the saving salt of the gospel." The Lord was especially solicitous of children. He said, "Tak
