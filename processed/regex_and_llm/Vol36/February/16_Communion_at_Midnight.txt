LESSON DEPARTMENT. 129 Visiting Seachers ITlessages—Our Savior -: Speaks Lesson 8—"Ye Are the Light of the World" Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, May 3, 1949 Objective: To emphasize that where much is given much is expected. THE Lord in blessing his saints with membership in the Church has likewise required of them obligations. He would have: them placed before the world as worthy examples. A city that is set upon a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house (Matt. 5:14-15). Who in his Church are best qualified to exemplify the Master? Does wealth or position entitle an individual a prominent place in his kingdom? Is it the learned who may be pointed out as reflecting his teachings? No, for God has so set up his laws that any man, whether of high or low degree, may serve equally well to reflect the gospel light. | § "Ye are the light of the world. So spoke our Savior to common folk like you and me and, in so doing, he exhibited his full confidence that his followers would measure up. A pertinent question for each of us today might well be, "Do we in our individualities justify his confidence? How may we measure up?" When Christ said: "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven," it was a personal request. And yet, there is a great and universal appeal in this entreaty. It reaches out to everyone. And, in responding to Christ's call, 'we may, each and all of us through our acts of righteous living make it possible for Christ to say of us: "Ye are the light of the world" (Matt. 5:14). _<- Communion at Midnight Lizabeth Wall For a little quiet while Let there be no one around; Let not any footstep fall, Nor a breath, nor sudden sound.

The Church me in hand. |! Desire the learning he had founded amid such travail LESSON DEPARTMENT al, even world power and influence. Well could he radiate gladness and humble thanksgiving and praise to God. Unhappily days of trouble and tragedy were soon to follow. Mark Twain, in his characteristic style once said something which seems to apply aptly to the situation in those palmy days: "Few of us can stand prosperity; another man's I mean." Nauvoo had become the largest, most thriving city in Illinois. The Latter-day Saints held the balance of political power; and that brought jealousy and strife, both within and without the Church. Literature produced during this time naturally was not only in vigorous defense of the principles of the restored gospel, but also was often directed towards building up Amenca with better, more righteous govermment. In other words, Joseph Smith and those who stood loyally with him, rising above petty politics, expressed themselves boldly and clearly on fundamental principles of true Americanism. Some such utterances by the Prophet are statesmanlike: The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard; it is a heavenly banner; it is like a great tree under whose branches men from all climes can be shielded from the burning rays of an inclement sun: and Mormon as well as Presbyterian, and every other denomination have equal rights to partake of the fruits of this great tree of our national Liberty. We believe that every man should be honored in his station rulers and magistrates, as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent, and the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws, all men owe respect and deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted for the express 131 purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and nations (Scrapbook of Mormon Literature, II, pp. 6-9). The Prophet's plan for resolving the slavery problem in a peaceable way, through purchase and resettlement of these unfortunates, is an example of his grasp and forwardthinking on national issues. Eleven years later, when Ralph Waldo Emerson proposed essentially the same procedure, he won acclaim from the Nation. And at the time Josiah Quincy wrote that this way out of a serious difficulty had been offered more than a decade before by the Mormon Prophet, Joseph Smith, and his statement was _ received in silence. Until the flames of war came, people were not ready to listen. Nor in those fateful days of 1843- 44, would they hearken—the Nation at large—to the inspired words of this leader. Instead, malicious ones of religious creeds, and unscrupulous politicians banded together to bring destruction to this Prophet and the Church he had founded. Aided by traitors within the membership, these evil ones finally wrought their wicked will. Literature portraying the waxing strife and the aftermath of Carthage is readily available. Joseph Smith went, as he said: "Like a lamb to the slaughter, but," said he, "I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense toward God, and towards all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me—he was murdered in cold blood." Out of this tragedy literature of soul-lifting cast has been created. The following by Apostle Orson Hyde reaches literary heights: 132 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 Twenty-seventh of' June, 1844. Eventful period in the calendar of the nineteenth century! That awful night! I re member it well: I shall never forget it!. Thousands and tens of thousands will never forget it! A solemn thnll—a melancholy awe comes o'er my spirit! 'The memorable scene is fresh before me! It requires no art. Of the pencil, no retrospection of history, to portray it. The impression of the Almighty Spirit on that occasion will run parallel with eternity! The scene was not portrayed by earthquake, or thunderings, and lightnings, and tempests; but the majesty and sovereignty of Jehovah was felt far more impressively in the still, small voice of that significant hour, than the roaring of many waters, or the artillery of many thunders, when the spirit of Joseph was driven back to the bosom of God, by an ungrateful and bloodthirsty world! There was an unspeakable something, a portentious significancy on the firmament and among the inhabitants of the earth. Multitudes felt the whisperings of woe and grief, and the forebodings of tribulation and sorrow that they will never forget, though the tongue of man can never utter it. The Saints of God, whether near the scene of blood, or even a thousand miles distant, felt at the very moment the Prophet lay in royal gore, that an awful deed was perpetrated. O, the repulsive chill! The melancholy vibrations of the very air, as the prince of darkness receded in hopeful triumph from the scene of slaughter! That night could not the Saints sleep, though uninformed by man of what had passed with the Seer and Patriarch, and far, far remote from the scene; yet to them sleep refused. A visitation—the eyelids refused to close—the hearts of many sighed deeply in secret, and inquired, "Why am I thus?" Shall I attempt to describe the scene at Nauvoo on that memorable evening? If I could, surely you would weep, whatever may be your faith or skepticism, if the feelings of humanity are lodged in your bosom: all prejudice and mirth would slumber, till the eye of pity had bedewed the bier, and the heart had found relief in lamentation. But here I must pause; my pen shall touch lightly, as it must feebly, that hallowed—that solemn and ever-memorable hour! The holy and immutable principle of retribution for crime that dwells eternally in the bosom of God, insensibly impelled the right hand almost to draw the glittering sword, and feel the sharpness of the bayonet's point and its fixedness to the musket's mouth. But the well-planted principle of self-command, and also of observing the order of Heaven and the counsel of the Priesthood, soon returned the deadly steel to the scabbard; and the victorious triumph of loyalty to God, in committing. Evil-doers to Him that judgeth righteously, and who hath said, "Vengeance is mine, and I will repay" prevailed over the billows of passion. (Scrapbook of Mormon Literature, I, pp. 283-285). Among the first expressions of praise and exultation was the song, already mentioned from the pen of W. W. Phelps, a stanza of which we repeat: Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven Traitors and tyrants now fight him in | vain; Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his brethren; Death cannot conquer the hero again. A wealth of songs extolling the Prophet may be found—some of them of classic quality. Naturally, also, there were other types of effective expression. From John Taylor, who was shot down, and all but killed in Carthage when Joseph and Hyrum were martyred, we have not only his vivid. Portrayal of that tragic day, but also his poetic tribute, "The Seer"—voicing grief triumphant. The last stanza of this poem follows: He's free! He's free! The Phophet's freel He is where he will ever be, Beyond the reach of mobs and strife, He rests unharmed in endless life. His home's in the sky, he dwells with the Gods, Far from the furious rage of mobs. He died! He died for those he loved, He reigns, he reigns in the realms above. LESSON DEPARTMENT He waits with the just who have gone before, To welcome the saints to Zion's shore; Shout, shout, ye saints his boon is given; We'll meet our martyred Seer in heaven. The following incident also brings us close to John Taylor, who became the third President of our Church. It occurred, after his wounds had healed, in Nauvoo. Major Warren was sent there by Governor Ford, to supervise in a military way the affairs of Hancock County. Word had reached this officer that the Latter-day Saint leaders had determined to do their own defending of their rights—even if. Need be to resist the law. In answer, Elder Taylor said, with the rng of Patrick Henry's "Liberty or Death" speech in his words: Major Warren, I stand before you as a man who has suffered deep injury from the citizens of this state, and consequently have some feelings. You talk, sir, about 'the majesty of the law and maintaining the law.' Why, sir, the law to us is a mere farce. For years past the law has been made use of only as an engine of oppression. We have received no protection from it. I have suffered under its cruel influence. _ You talk about your troops being efficient, supporting law and preserving peace. This tale may do to tell some, but it fails to charm us. You talk about the majesty of the law! What has become of those murderers [i. E. Of Joseph and Hyrum Smith]? Have they been hung or shot, or in any way punished? No, sir, you know they have not. With their hands yet reeking in blood, having become hardened in their deeds of infamy, knowing they will not be punished, they are now applying the torch to the houses of ae they have already so deeply injured. Major Warren tried to stop the speaker, but Apostle Taylor brushed him aside. 133 Where is the spirit of '76? Where is the fire that burned in the bosoms of those who fought and bled for liberty?. Talk about law! Sir, I stand before you as a victim of law. I feel warm on this subject—who would not? I have seen my best friends shot down while under legal protection. What is our governor? These scene' have been enacted under his supervision And you will talk to us of law and order, and threaten us with punishment for disobeying your commands and protecting our rights! What are we? Are we beasts? I tell you for one, sit, I shall protect myself, law or no law, judge or no judge, governor or no governor, I will not stand such infernal rascality, and if I have to fight it out, I will sell my life as dearly as I can (Roberts, B. H., Life of John Taylor, pp. 163- 166). Major Warren did not serve the papers he had come to serve on the twelve apostles—and the judge who had issued them thought it wise not to press the case further. Those tragic days, we are glad, have passed. They are recalled today with less fire. Yet they are not forgotten, and lessons they call to mind still bring inspiring expression.

Homer Durham For Tuesday, May 25, 1949 Objective: To appreciate the part some Latter-day Saints have taken in recent political activities and the obligation resting on Latter-day Saints to teach their children the doctrines of free agency and liberty in harmony with Latter-day Saint knowledge. — — ij EVAN JENSEN FREE agency permits men to do good or evil; to construct prosperous, peaceful communities, or to war with each other. If "courtesy" and spiritual forbearance are essential to traffic safety (as suggested in lesson one), what spiritual development and "courtesy" must men with atomic bombs develop? The Millennial Hope For generations men have longed for the day when "the lamb and the lion shall lie down together without any ire," when swords shall become plowshares and spears be turned in- - to pruning hooks. Notwithstanding, some of the world's bloodiest wars have been the wars of religion. But at the same time the world's religions have helped keep alive mankind's vision of peace on earth. The ideal of the kingdom of God in the Christian religion particularly, has rendered this service. A foundation principle of Mormonism, and one of its interesting contributions to' political doctrines, is that it is now within the reach of men—and their obligation—to "bring forth and establish the kingdom of God." This religious ideal, we have seen, has been fortified with practical devices. President John Taylor, nearly a century ago, November 24, 1855, wrote: Although the present distracted state of the world might seem to forbid the expectation of an immediate amalgamation, yet the rapid increase of means of communication, the sure and decided comingling of interests, a universal exchange of sentiment, an increasing desire among mankind to shake off the shackles of despotism and enjoy the liberty of speech and conscience—all conspire to show that such a combination of circumstances must eventually result in some kind of universal government—moral, religious, and political (The Gospel Kingdom, page 303). A few years later, January 17, 1858, the same leader stated: The germs of this peace are with us; the LESSON DEPARTMENT intelligence conceming these matters has begun to be developed (Ibid., page 305). Section 65 of the Doctrine and Covenants, speaking of the restoration of the "keys of the kingdom" to man on the earth, declares: Wherefore, may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven. May come And the Tenth Article of Faith states simply that we believe "the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory." Practical Idealism If the peoples of the world understood each other better, their geography, living habits, governmental systems, and social customs, the technological revolution _ referred to by President John Taylor might well "result in some kind of universal government." But the world, as also noted by Joseph Smith and many Latter-day Saint leaders since 1830, is "split up and divided into - different objects... And watching each other as so many thieves" (The Gospel Kingdom, page 299). Instead of understanding, misunderstanding is too often promoted as each nation controls its own press, schools, films, radio, and other massmedia. In rather sharp contrast, the Latter-day Saints, since the day in 1830 when Samuel H. Smith strapped some copies of the Book of Mormon on his back, have, by means of the missionary system, systematically exploited the possibilities of international understanding. Particularly has this been true among the countries of Northwestern Europe, Australia, South Africa, Mexico, certain Pacific isles, and, more 135 recently, Argentina and Brazil. A continuous stream of missionaries has gone forth, and until about 1925, a continuous flood of immigrants poured into the Latter-day Saint communities. As a result, Stephen Duggan, for many years director of the Institute of International Education, said that Salt Lake City was the center of international understanding. Latter-day Saint missionaries have, by themselves, negotiated no remarkable international agreements, but the contribution, even at the diplomatic level, has by no means been insignificant. On the authority of Elder Don Corbett, a major in the United States Army, it was a former Latter-day Saint missionary to Germany, Dr. David White, who translated the surrender terms imposed by General Dwight D. Eisenhower on General von Rundstedt and the German High Command, May 1945; and who, moreover, by his skill, corrected several details in the German-Allied correspondence which were of major importance. A Utah-born diplomat from a famous missionary family, Cavendish W. Cannon, was one of the expert consultants present at the 'TrumanStalin - Churchill - Attlee meeting which produced the Potsdam agreement of July 1945. A former missionary, Colonel Floyd W. Goates, was actively in charge of certain Japanese educational activities in the reconstruction of Japan. A young missionaty, Thomas W. Thorsen, was a detachment commander in the United States military government set-up in Europe, and produced an eighteen-volume memorandum on Norway's economy which tated him 136 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 a decoration by the Norwegian government. Dr. Dale D. Clark of Farmington, a former. Missionary to Germany, was active throughout the war in the planning section of the SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces) and later saw active responsibility in the reconstruction of Austria and Germany. And the recent examples could be multiplied—such as _ the work of Dr. Llewellyn R. McKay, Paul W. Hodson, Stanley D. Rees, and Eldon J. Facer—all former missionaries to Germany, in the Strategic Bombing Survey of 1945. Even more interesting and subtle, have been the contributions of such Latter-day Saint missionary products as Reed Smoot, Elbert D. 'Thomas, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Edgar B. Brossard and others. Dr. John Mabry Matthews, in his volume on American Foreign Relations, states without hesitation that the nowfamous "good neighbor policy" stems from the work of J. Reuben Clark, Jr., as Undersecretary of State, citing in particular President Clark's official report, Memorandum on the Monroe Doctrine (1928), as an important basis therefor. Dr. Hubert Herring has told many a lecture audience that the real shift toward improved American relations with Latin-America dates from the ambassadorships of Dwight W. Morrow and J. Reuben Clark to Mexico. Too often overlooked in the current interest in nations to the south is the fact, also, that as an official American representative, President Clark, many years ago, as General Counsel for the United States before the American-British Claims Commission, assisted in solving some of the oldest and touchiest problems between the United States, England, and Canada; involving fishing rights in the North Atlantic and other long-standing controversies. The influence of Reed Smoot in the international financial arrangements of the twenties and the Hoover moratorium policies, is a story yet to be told. The unique oriental missicnary experience of Senator Elbert D. Thomas was put to many uses before, during, and after World War I{—not to mention his many European conferences as an Official American delegate. After World War II, when America was being asked for loans and credits to promote European recovery, it was interesting to observe that one of three American representatives negotiating the original post-war British loan was at one time a Latter-day Saint missionary to Scotland, Marriner S. Eccles, the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. And one of the American delegates to the Geneva Conference of 1947 designed to establish an International Trade Organization was Dr. Edgar B. Brossard, former missionary to France, and at that time, chairman of the United States 'Tariff Commission. All of these persons, together with hundreds of others unnamed, may or may not have been conscious of the root doctrines of American Latter-day Saint political theory as they discharged their official duties. But none will gainsay the fact that the day-by-day living experiences they had as missionaries with the common people of Northwestern Europe, or that were their traditions as LESSON DEPARTMENT members of communities and families into which such experience constantly was being kneaded, could not help but contribute to a deeper understanding of the essential problems of international life. If the present rate of missionary work continues (it could exceed it!) by 1970—a date comparable with the period between World War I and II—it is possible that, in addition to these of the past, there can be 75,000 additional men and women who will have experienced active Latter-day Saint missionary work. In 1970 they will be the vigorous citizens and community leaders who will face the world. Their contribution, with other men and women of good will the world over, including those whose lives they may touch, may well tip the balances for peace or for war. Moreover, many members of this young "army" will have — been "ambassadors" of the United States and of constitutional government, and of a way of life that teaches liberty, tolerance, generosity, and forbearance. The cumulative effects on world opinion and American diplomacy— if this work is well done—are not to be overlooked. Most of the Western Hemisphere, save for the Northeast, was largely "conquered" by Spanish priests—missionaries—in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Much of Asia and Africa became provinces of the British Empire in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in which the work of the "Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts" and other British missionary societies were by no means inconsequential. Yet, no one need fear the Latter-day Saint 137 missionary abroad! He asks nothing save from those who voluntarily would like to be immersed in water, and who thereafter remain free men, "believing in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates." And he pays his own way, which nowadays helps the dollar balances so nervously sought after by foreign governments! Opportunity of Latter-day Saint Mothers What can a Latter-day Saint mother do? She can study and understand the gospel, including its application to the problems involved in socialism, communism, and international relations. She can teach the meaning of liberty and free agency to her children. She can make of her family, with the father's help, a model of constitutional government. She can help conduct the "foreign relations" of that family with other families, Latter-day Saint and non-Latter-day Saint, so as to produce a happier community. She can teach her children the principles of good government by teaching them individually to pray, and by insisting on family prayers. She can help educate her sons ("the glory of God is intelligence!" ) and send them on missions. She can point out that liberty is earned; that it has obligations. The family hearth may become the center of a continuous school, not only in constitutional government and sound _ political theory, but for all problems of society, by reminding one and all that life is what we make it; that the kingdom of God men seek in outward environment, is within each one of us, as Jesus taught. 138 Ww.

Elder Snow was born in Mantua, Ohio, in 1814, and although reared in a family of devout HEN Wilford Woodruff died in 1898, he was succeeded by Lorenzo Snow, a man who had LESSON DEPARTMENT Christians, had failed to find satisfaction in any of the religious denominations of the day. He had ambitions to become a professional military leader, and enrolled in Oberlin College, a strict Presbyterian institution. From there he wrote to his sister Eliza R. Snow, "If there is nothing better than is to be found in Oberlin College, goodbye to all religions." He desired to study Hebrew and finding that it was possible to secure Hebrew instruction in nearby Kirtland, went there. He was indifferent to the religious beliefs of his colleagues, but after only a short acquaintance with the Prophet Joseph, he joined the Church in June 1836. The military career was forgotten and he became a soldier in the army of God, fighting for the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth. © He brought to the councils of leadership in the Church a great deal of practical experience, acquired in the service of the Church. During the winter of 1846-1847, he was left in charge of the temporary camp of the saints at Mt. Pisgah, Iowa. Here he manifested great ability as an organizer, utilizing the various capacities of the members to manufacture, churns, barrels, etc., which they sold or exchanged for food. He also delegated others to labor in Missouri and take their wages in foodstuffs. So successful were these ventures that during the winter, the once destitute and starving saints were able to send gifts of food to the saints at Winter Quarters. It was not until 1848 that Lorenzo Snow migrated to the Salt Lake Valley. In February 1849 he was called to be one of the twelve apostles 139 H SMITH Prophet-Statesman By Dr. G.

Arriving in Italy in June 1850, he labored with great energy among the Waldensian sect in the Piedmont Valley. Elder Snow was instrumental in having the Book of Mormon translated into Italian and also wrote a number of missionary tracts. He directed the opening of the mission in Switzerland where much success was enjoyed, and then went to the island of Malta for the same purpose. From this point he arranged for the opening of missionary work in British India. Returning from these missiona endeavors he was called to take fifty families and settle Brigham City. There he established his home and lived for forty years. It was while he resided at Brigham City that the "United Order" of co-operative enterprise was introduced and met with a high degree of success. The city was a self-sustaining community, with about forty diversified industries, producing many fine manufactured goods ranging from linen collars, broadcloth suits and silk hats, to kid gloves and dress shoes, cheese, furniture, and wagons. Lorenzo Snow was eighty-five years of age when he became President of the Church on September 13, 1898, just eleven days after the death of President Woodruff. In spite of his advanced age, he enjoyed good health and the manner in which he attacked the problems facing the Church indicates that the Lord had called one to preside whose training in practical affairs would be of great benefit to the Church. "I do not want this admin- & LIGHT Go. Istration to be known as Lorenzo Snow's administration," he states, LESSON DEPARTMENT "but as God's in and through Lorenzo Snow." The most pressing problem was that of financing the Church. Dur. Ing the years of persecution the Church income had dwindled almost to nothing and it had been necessary to borrow money to keep the Church operating. President Snow determined to issue $1,000,000 in short-term bonds to raise money to keep the Church's various missions, temples, and administrative activities functioning. Although some insisted it would be necessary to do this in the East, President Joseph F. Smith insisted it could be done locally, and the entire amount was subscribed within Utah. The next problem was to secure for the Church a steady source of income that would repay the bonds and give the Church sufficient income to maintain itself. Joseph Fielding Smith describes the reason for the falling off of Church income during these years as follows: During the time of trouble with the government over the question of plural marriage, and especially after the confiscation of the property of the Church, the members of the Church quite generally became lax in the payment of their tithing. They were discouraged. Their leaders were either cast into prison or forced to seek the quiet of retirement from public duties. Under these conditions the members of the Church were neglected. Moreover, realizing that their means turned into the treasury of the Church as tithing were greedily seized upon by unscrupulous officials and for these and other reasons, they became neglectful of duty especially in regard to the payment of their tithes and offerings (Life of Joseph F. Smith, page 307). Immediately after becoming President of the Church, President Snow began a campaign to awaken 141 VT VV VV VV VY wwwww Son?

At a solemn assembly convened in the Salt Lake Temple, he said: Teach your children to pay tithing, so that it may be perpetually observed. If we observe this law, no matter what-our enemies may do, the Lord will preserve us... Should we continue in this dilatory way of paying tithing, we will be scattered just as the people of the Jackson County were, This is true as God is true. While speaking at the Mutual Improvement Conference that year, he appealed to them for their support in sustaining the principle of tithing. At the conclusion of his discourse the following resolution was presented to these representatives of neatly every stake in the Church, and unanimously adopted by them: Resolved: That we accept the doctrine of tithing, as now presented by President Snow, as the present word and will of the Lord unto us, and we accept it with all our hearts; we will ourselves observe it, and we will do all in our power to get the Latter-day Saints to do likewise. The remainder of the year 1899 became a year of tithe-preaching and tithe-paying throughout the stakes and missions of the Church. As a consequence, the people became _"tithing-conscious" and commenced to return to the Lord his portion of their material blessings. President Snow did not live long enough to see the complete rewards that resulted from this new emphasis, but he saw the first fruits of this divinely inspired reformation. During the administration of President Snow his counselors did all in their power to spare their President's waning strength by assuming as much of. The arduous work of the Presidency as they could. President Cannon traveled extensively throughout the Church, visiting stake conferences, dedicating chapels and giving counsel in spiritual and temporal affairs. In 1900 he went to Hawaii to attend the golden jubilee of the opening of the missionary work in that land, of which he had been one of the originators. He received a welcome upon arrival such as had, up to that time, never been accorded any visitor to the islands. President Cannon died rather suddenly while resting in California on Aptil 16, 1901. President Snow did not appoint another counselor then, but had President Smith take over as much of the responsibility of President Cannon as he could. President Smith also traveled extensively in the wards and stakes and in addition during these years visited the colonies of saints in Mexico, Arizona, New Mexico, and Canada, as well as a number of the mission fields. 'These visits were made to carry to these scattered saints the new emphasis upon tithing and to assist them in making plans for their future growth and the expansion of Church missionary work. At the October Conference in 1901 President Snow selected President Smith to be the first counselor in the Presidency and Rudger Clawson, one of the Council. Of Twelve, to be the second counselor. They were never set apart to these offices however, as President Snow died four days after conference, on October 10, 1901. His passing brought to a close an administration that placed the Church on a sound financial basis which has provided LESSON DEPARTMENT the necessary means for the remarkable growth in its missionary activities, temple and chapel building, educational endeavors, its hospital services and numerous charities that have characterized it in the twentieth century.. Questions and Problems for Discussion 1. What caused the general non-observance of the law of tithing on the part of the Church membership prior to 1899? 2. Why is it essential that the saints be constantly reminded to pay an honest tithing? 3.

Relate President Snow's account of his spiritual manifestation after he joined the Church as recorded in the Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow, pp. 7 and 8. (Also reprinted in Robert's Comprehensive History of the Church, VI, PP. 383-384). 5. Read the Rev.

Somehow the Magazine agent neglected to call on her earlier, but I hope that even at this late date, she can still be on the list. Our sisters all look forward to the arrival of the Magazine and feel that the material printed therein is very excellent. —Blanche K. Richmond, President, Australian Mission Relief Society I would like to tell you how much The Relief Society Magazine means to me. My husband and I were converts to the Church twenty-six years ago, shortly after the birth of our third child. We now have a family. Of twelve, seven daughters and five sons. For a few years after we became members we had missionary elders working in our district occasionally, then we moved away and had no contact with the Church. Through this period I was helped many times by The Relief Society Magazine. The stories and articles printed in it were a constant source of inspiration to me. I would not miss being a subscriber to the Magazine, even if the price increased fourfold. Money could not give me the comfort and assurance that the Magazine gives to me from between its valued pages. —lIrene E. J. Edwards, Paterson, Australia I have never wished I were a woman, nor anything else other than what the Father in heaven has begotten me to be. Still, I often think were I a woman and could have part in the heavenly work our Relief Society sisters are doing, then I'd be too happy and busy to wish I were anything else. Generally it is I who go to the door when the postman arrives and on days when The Relief Society Magazine is received, don't suppose for a minute that I toss it to Sister M. Oh no, it's probably the only time in our home when daddy asserts his dignity, or needs to, for that matter. But just ask Sister Mitchell if I don't simply glue myself to that little Magazine for an hour or so. But being clever, as Relief Society sisters are wont to be, she sweetly busies herself about the living room, but one can tell her covetPage 144 ing little heart is wishing you at the office would print the Magazine in some strictly feminine language which husbands couldn't decipher. —Bert C. Mitchell, Salem, Oregon I thought this was too good to keep to myself. I went to meeting Tuesday. Before the lesson started I raised my hand and said "I want to say a few words for The Relief Society Magazine. This is the last call as orders must be in one month ahead. Now, sisters, let me help you all with your Christmas shopping. There is nothing nicer than a year's subscription to the Magazine for a present. I will be sitting at that table when the meeting is over waiting for your orders." And was I surprised to get twenty orders. I am happy to talk about the Magazine. —Charlotte O'Connor, Hollywood, California There is no book large or small that brings s
