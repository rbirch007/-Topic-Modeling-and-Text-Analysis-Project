ption of the world as it is (read text, pp. 710-711). Or note the names of the jurors in "Vanity Fair" who condemn Faithful to death, and how their character is echoed in their speech: Mr. Blind-man, the foreman, said, I see clearly that this man is an heretic. Then said Mr. No-good, Away with such a fellow from the earth. Aye, said Mr. Malice, for I hate the very looks of him. Then said Mr, Love-lust, I could never endure him. Nor T, said Mr. Live-loose, for he would always be condemning my way. Hang him, hang him, said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr. High-mind. My heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity. He is a Togue, said Mr. Liar. Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty. Let's dispatch him out of the Way, said Mr. Hate-light. Synopsis of the Pilgrim's Progress The author begins by saying he dreamed a dream, and in the dream he saw a man clothed in rags with a book in his hand and a burden on his back. In mental anguish the man inquired of the Evangelist, "What shall I do to be saved?" The Evangelist advised Christian (for that was the man's name) to flee the City of Destruction and make for the City of Zion. "Keep yonder light in your eye and go to the Gate, where it shall be told thee what to do." After almost sinking in the Slough of Despond, Christian was rescued by Help and approached the Gate, Over which was written, "Knock and it shall be opened unto you." The Gate was opened by Goodwill and Christian told him of the perils encountered while seeking to be rid of his burden. Goodwill advised, "Be content to wear it until thou come to the place of deliverance, for there it will fall off of itself" The Pilgrim (Christian) was given a guide and a blessing and started on his way to the Celestial City. The highway was fenced on either side with a wall called Salvation. Up this way Christian walked till the toad ended on an elevation where stood a cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulcher. As he came up to the cross his burden loosened from his back and 849 fell into the sepulcher and was seen no more. Here Christian was given a change of raiment and a roll to read as he went, with instructions to present it at the Celestial City. In the Valley of Humiliation Christian was confronted by the fiend, Apollyon and a dreadful battle ensued, in which Christian was finally victorious. From thence he traveled on to the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Here the pathway was exceedingly narrow, on one hand a very deep ditch and on the other a dangerous quag. Darkness also prevailed. After traveling disconsolately for sometime, Christian thought he heard a man. Say, "Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me." Then he was glad and morning broke. Faithful, Christian's friend, had followed, and together they entered Vanity Fair, where they were thrown into jail. Faithful was burned at the stake but Christian was released and continued on with Hopeful, another follower. At Doubting Castle they were again taken prisoners by the Giant Despair and when all seemed lost, Christian and Hopeful prayed and they were able to escape. As they approached the Delectable Mountains, they were welcomed by the shepherds, Knowledge, Experience, Watchful, and Sincere, who gave them good counsel and led them to the top of the hill called Clear, where they could see the gates of the Celestial City. After passing through the country of Deceit they traveled to the land called Enchanted Ground, where they had a distant view of the City of Zion, in all its glory. But between them and the City ran the River of Death, which they must cross. There was no bridge over it so they had to go through the waters.. After entering, Christian began to sink but Hopeful cheered him on continually and they finally reached the other side. The City stood on a mighty hill but they climbed with ease, for two Shining Ones led them. Their mortal garments had been left behind in the flood. As they entered in at the Gate, after presenting their certificates, they were transfigured and given raiment that shone like gold, while they heard, "Enter ye Into the joy of your Lord." 850 The second part of this great work tells how Christian's wife Christiana, also reached the Celestial City. Despite the rich satire throughout the book, despite his beautiful use of Biblical landscape and imagery, and despite his ability to make our senses acutely aware of smells and sights and ideas, The Pilgrim's Progress, Part I, is most grim. Throughout all our consciences rings Christian's wail, "What shall I do to be saved?" (text, pp. 706-707). The fight with Apollyon (text, pp. 707-710), powerful narration that it is, is far too near Our Own constant battle with the forces of darkness for it to be read lightly and with comfort. Even though Bunyan allows us to intrude into Giant Despair's bedroom in the small hours of the night to hear the Giant being counseled by his wife Diffidence about the affairs of the day—even though we enjoy this homey touch in him, Giant is brutal, and the episode is read with loathing and a sinking heart (text, pp. 711-714). Yet when we read of the Celestial City (text, pp. 714-718) and _particularly of the slower, more majestic account of the pilgrims crossing the river of death to enter the beautiful city as recorded at the conclusion of the milder, more tolerRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 ant Part II, we know full well that all struggle and pain were well worth such a goal; we know as well that when Bunyan says of the Eternal City, as he says of everything in the book, "And I saw in my dream—" he saw that which was more real and living than anything this world can offer. Truly, such a conclusion alone is worthy of the book which nghtfully has come to be known as the Great Protestant Allegory, and one of the monumental imaginative and spiritual works of all time. Note to teachers: Encouragement should be given the sisters to read The Pilgrim's Progress for themselves. Questions 1. Did John Bunyan consider himself a writer or a preacher? 2.

Social Science—Latter-day Saint Political Thought Lesson 5—The Obligations of Citizenship and the Responsibility of the State—(D. & C. 134:5, 6, 7, 8) Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, March 28, 1950 Objective: To show the responsibility of the State to enact proper laws and of the people to uphold them. Relation of the Individual to Types of Government HE tise in Communism, Fascism, and various types of totalitarian States has emphasized the problem that modern man has in adjusting the needs of his personal life to that of the group. In Communist countries, men must bow to the will of the State as interpreted by its Communist rulers. In Communism, as in other dictatorships, the highest good and, therefore, the noblest obligation of citizenship (if it can be called noble), is to follow "the party line' and obey accordingly the leaders of the State. The same doctrine in one form or another characterizes all totalitarian States. What are the obligations of citizenship? Must men always, blindly, obey? What are the responsibilities of the State to its citizens? Here are two fundamental questions the nature of which permeates headlines in the daily newspaper. The Declaration of Belief Regarding Government and Laws charts a certain, clear course as to what the answers to these questions should be. Upholding Just Governments Should) men always obey State? The Should they obey every law? The Declaration answers (verse five): We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; and that sedition and rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience. When should men obey the State? Should men obey every State? 'The answer is clear. All men, everywhere, should support the government in which they reside so long as they are protected in their fundamental rights. Perhaps the most fundamental right is that of free agency. And the free agency of man expresses itself most fundamentally in freedom of conscience, particularly religious freedom. Have governments the right to enact any law they see fit? The answer is definitely "no". Government has the right to enact laws. But only such laws, says the Declaration, as "are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, Page 85] RELIEF SOCIETy MAGAZINE_DECEMpEp 1949 holding Sacted the freedom of Consuch, being Placed for he protec.

To the Presidency he also brought Nibley likewise fostered the acquisition of some of the historic landmarks connected with the early history of the Church in New England and New York. Joshua Reuben Clark, Jr. December 11, 1931, President Nibley died and, in his place, Presjdent Grant chose Elder Joshua Reuben Clark, Jt. At the time of his selection to this office, President Clark was not too well-known to the membership of the Church. For thirty years he had lived away from Utah, most of the time residing in New York, Washington, D. C., and Mexico. While not too well-known in his native Utah, few members farm. He knew what hard Physical labor was, as he did farm work and In 1898, he was graduated Utah, hayNg majored in scientific work. For five years he taught school or 4s principal in Heber City, Cedar City, and Salt Lake City. His "ver-€ager mind searched for greater fields of activity and the Study of law appealed to him. Although he was thirty-two years of age, was marned, and had two children, with nothing of this world's goods except $300, he moved to New York with his family and entered the Jaw school of Columbia University. His professors recognized in him at once 4 man of unusual gifts, He Possessed One of the most brilliant minds and greatest capacities for difficult work that they had ever seen. As a consehe found employment as international Jaw and Government jn settling foreign claims and untangling knotty international Problems. At the State as_ the International Conference and problems Connected with the Versailles Treaty, about which he had become one of the foremost authorities, Various published books were compiled, edited, or written by President Clark deal- 858 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 ing with problems of international law. He was assigned to work on problems dealing with Latin-American matters and became so _ proficient in this field that Ambassador Dwight W. Morrow took him to Mexico as his legal advisor during a time of great stress in regard to United States interests in Mexico. On Brother Clark's return, he was appointed Under Secretary of State by President Coolidge. So ably had he worked and won the confidence and respect of the Mexican officials when he was aiding Ambassador Morrow that, when Ambassador Morrow resigned his post after election to the United States Senate in 1930, President Clark was appointed ambassador in his stead. It was from this post of honor and respect that President Grant called him to be his second counselor in April oe During the years that President Clark had resided away from Utah not only had he studied international law, but he had studied the scriptures and the gospel. His sermons are models of eloquence and contain spiritual messages of great worth. He has the unusual ability to state in a few words the vital part of his message. He speaks with great conviction and his sermons and admonitions are the summary of serious thinking about the Church and world problems. Many of his sermons are prophetic in nature, and some, such as his tribute to the pioneers (Io Them of the Last Wagon, which is the classic description of this great migration of the Latterday Saints,) are poetic in form. His radio addresses and writings on the New Testament message are_brilliant studies reflecting his profound scholarship. One of President Clark's greatest characteristics is his uncompromising honesty. The statement, "face the facts," is one of his oftrepeated phrases. He does just that himself, whether he is dealing with a problem of law, a problem of the Church, a problem of scripture, or a problem of life. To President Grant's administration he brought these great gifts of understanding, faith in the restored gospel, a strong robust physique, and a discriminating intellect. He was devoted to President Grant and did all he could to assist the President during his declining years. David Oman McKay On September 23, 1934, President Anthony W. Ivins, eighty-two years of age, passed from mortality. J. Reuben Clark, Jr., was then advanced to the position of first counselor, and the council of the First Presidency was completed with the appointment of David O. McKay. Elder McKay had been a member of the Council of the Twelve since 1906, and was well known throughout the length and breadth of the Church. The McKay home was at Huntsville, Utah, and here David was born on September 8, 1873. He learned the nature and value of physical toil on the farm and it impressed him so that to this day he and his brothers and sisters possess ownership of the old farm home, and take a deep interest in its many functions. President McKay is a great lover of horses, and his greatest delight is to get back to the farm and to his the Holy Land, circumnavigating the globe, and traveling g distance 62,500 miles, During this trip, on January g, 1921, he dedicated the land of China for the Preaching of e 5 Guide Us, 0 Thou Great Jehovah | over which he Presided.
