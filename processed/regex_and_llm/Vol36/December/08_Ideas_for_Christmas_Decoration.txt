one forefinger, Doctor Weldon held a chair for her and Joanna sank into it, still holding David's hand. She said to Abigail, "We forgot the children -+. It I don't want it to be too great a shock..." Abigail nodded. "I know. I'll go back and tell them." She paused beside Joanna, opened her mouth to speak, and then turned and left -.. Wordlessly. The nurse came back into the room, bent over David. She and the doctor whispered together. Joanna did not hear them. She sat quietly, holding David's hand. After the years of having so much of him, his laughter, and his presence, his clothes spilling over in his toom, his scattered books, it seemed strange to be so humbly grateful for so smal] a thing as his breathing and his hand in hers. The nurse and Doctor Weldon went away. Joanna did not notice. She remembered the day David was born, her first knowledge of anguish and terror. She remembered when the nurse had brought him to her and how David had looked, like 830 a fighter, much the worse for wear. She remembered when he was three and she had tucked him in for the night, how he had lifted his brown eyes to hers and said, "I love you and I like you." She remembered the day they had buried Big David. The neighbor's bonfire and small David's shadow, stretching long across the path. Once betore in her life she had known this utter desolation and despair. Like a drowning woman clutching straws, she had gone to her room and knelt beside the little rocker. ENTLY, she put his hand down on the sheet and rose and went over to the window. She stared, unseeing, down into the lights of the valley, remembering the day she had asked for help for her children. She had asked for bread. Bread? The very windows of heaven had opened and riches beyond her dreams had been her portion. " And I have forgotten. For a long time I've thought, allowed myself to think, that I did it all myself. I didn't want to be humble any more or grateful. I wanted to be what people said I was, rich, successful, and marvelously clever." She leaned her forehead against the cold window. How can I go to him now? How can I think he will hear me? "Please," she whispered, "I, who would not come to you with my riches, now come in my want. There is none else to help me, there never has been, only I was too proud and blind to admit and remember. Please... He is so young... Boys like him are needed... So many have been lost." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 She bowed her head in her hands and fought silently against the completion of the prayer. After a long moment she said, "Nevertheless... Not my will, but thine, because thine is always the right and perfect way." The reassurance came instantly, the beautiful joy that she remembered at once, though it had been many years since she had experienced it. The joy that was peace and love and the sweet assurance that all would be well... That David would recover. It was as though she had groped for years in a room of shadows, stumbling over things, not being able to see, when all the while the key had been in her hands. She went back and sat beside David and leaned her wet face upon his hand. Doctor Weldon and the nurse came back. 'They examined David again, their faces grave and quiet. The nurse gave Joanna a swift look shot with pity and foreknowledge. Joanna smiled. "He is going to get well," she said. The doctor and the nurse exchanged glances. "There is always a chance,' they said with forced heartiness and unbelief. David stirred and mumbled. They bent over to him, the three of them. He opened his eyes, staring blindly at the ceiling. "Mom?" Not knowing she was there, the word pushed up from the disordered fragments of thought. Joanna smoothed his cheek. "I'm here, David," she said, though she knew he could not hear. "Get well quickly, you are going to England, remember? On a mission." JOANNA The nurse looked at her curiously. They still think he will die, Joanna thought, but he will be well in no time at all. T was the sixth of October. Joanna sat on the low wall that surrounded the pond of the Seagull Monument and tried to listen to the sermon, broadcast over the loud speaker. But try as she would, her thoughts kept moving to the people around her, wondering about them. They drifted past her, or stood quietly, their faces listening and rapt. Beautiful people, she thought, something so clean and fresh about them. Children played around the pool coatless, their bare arms silken smooth in the warm gold of the October sun. Girls went by in groups, like blown flowers, or walked sedately by the side of their young men, their faces lifted and rapturous, oblivious of those, like herself, who stared. Penny and Mark would be along any moment. They had promised to meet her. Joanna was impatient for their coming. It had been a week since she had seen Penny. She wondered how long before she would grow accustomed to Penny in her new role of wife. A man came through the crowds, walking slowly, looking all around. Joanna stared at him for several moments before she could believe her eyes. Kent! Kent, with his bright, arrogant head, tall above the throng. Kent, with his face incredibly lined and sunbeaten, walking through the conference crowds on an October afternoon. Joanna put her hands to her forehead and closed her eyes. When she opened them again he would be gone. 831 But when she lifted her lashes he was standing before her. "What an amazing bit of luck to find you here. You I just stepped off the train." He sat beside her. His eyes scrutinized her hungrily. Joanna wet her lips. She sat still under his gaze, wryly aware of the white wings of hair showing under her smart hat. "You're beautiful," he said. She had no wish to tear old wounds open. "I've been reading about you for years and years. Welcome home." He took a deep breath, looking all around him. "If I had a spoon I would gobble up all this sunshine. I saw the mountains coming in 1 had forgotten how breathtaking." "You've seen a great many beautiful places, to judge from your descriptions." "Home," he said, as though he had not heard. "Home. My place and my people, my streets and my hills, my earth " After a moment he turned to her, "I forgot, how are the youngsters?" She smiled. "David is in England still. He wrote me that he had lunch with you in London thrilled him to pieces, lunching with a world-famous war correspondent." "He's the salt of the earth, that boy. Penny is married?" "Yes. Sally and Michael and Abigail and I are the only ones home." She added lightly, "I did manage to bring them up, after all, in spite of all the alarms and excursions." His eyes went slowly over her (Continued on page 861) Ideas for Christmas Decoration Mary Grant Judd Member, Relief Society General Board [This is the eighth rangements, and related subjec
