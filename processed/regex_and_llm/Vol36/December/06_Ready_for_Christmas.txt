ple of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection." How can we, then, cultivate knowledge and intelligence in our quest for eternal values? First, we must be awakened to the need for growth, and then we shall find the means and opportunities for development. We not only gain knowledge through the study of great books, but through prayer we also find the ways and means of development. Let us not waste time. Benjamin Franklin wrote, "Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is what life is made of." One often hears this expression, "If I just had time to do this or that," but we overlook what can be accomplished by small snatches of time. Be ever alert to your opportunities. Study, seek good companions, insist upon filling your life with eternal riches. RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE You have a great birthright, you live in a land "choice above all other lands." You have accepted as a pattern of life the gospel of Jesus Christ. Your opportunities are unbounded. But only you can fashion your individual lives into glorious, 819 eternal mansions filled with the eternal light of truth. May God bless all of us that we may get the vision necessary to see life at its best and give us strength to live according to an eternal pattern. Digest—Prepare Shy Heart Leone O. Jacobs NE of the most glorious truths of life is that we can always rise above our present level. Wouldn't life be discouraging if, once we found ourselves involved in unworthy conduct, we couldn't pull ourselves up, and out, and on to better ways? But we don't have to remain as we are. Each day offers a new beginning. | An old man was once reviewing his life to a friend: "When I was thirty I was just no good—no good to anybody, not even to myself. Then one day I had the urge, the desire, to right about face. I decided I was going to change my direction, and from that moment I have led a life I'm proud of." A young college girl paused one day in her round of excitement and said, "I guess I'm going with the wrong crowd. I don't think I want to go where they're going." She didn't go that way. A mother of three husky little boys had never deemed it necessary to give them any religious instruction. Oh, yes, she fed them wellbalanced meals, kept them as clean as little boys can be kept, and saw to it that bedtime was strictly observed. But one day she pondered to herself, "I wonder if I'm a really good mother. I guess there's more to rearing a family than merely feeding and clothing them. I seem to have time for my bridge club and for social engagements in the evenings, but maybe I'm neglecting some important points." She did something about it. Lives can be changed, can't they? The course of our lives can be rerouted. But how? Let's call it preparing the heart. Well, what does preparing one's heart mean? It means checking up on one's self, scrutinizing one's daily life and evaluating what is there—what is worthy and what is unworthy of continuing. It means ridding one's self of bitterness and selfishness. It means humbling one's self before the Lord. It means complete forgiveness of all wrongs inflicted on us, either real or imagined. It means opening wide one's heart to righteousness—putting one's self in an attitude to receive good. It means planning one's course differently. Picture in your mind a field, plowed and harrowed from end to end, leveled perfectly, weeds burned down along the fence line, everything possible done that is conducive to the growth of good seed. The field is ready, waiting to receive that good seed. We can put our hearts in that very same condition, in an 820 attitude of receptiveness to good. We can plow up the old, useless habits and smooth down the rough places of error. We hear someone say, "I wish I could enjoy working in the Church as you do. It seems to make you so happy." They can. It's all in the set of the heart. It's all in preparing the heart to want that sort of living. And then we hear people say, too, "But I don't see how you get time for it all." In one of our recent Relief Society conventions, a bishop said something profoundly impotrtant for us to remember. He said, "If you're too busy to serve the Lord, you're too busy." Yes, if we are too busy to serve the Lord, then we are too busy doing other things that aren't so worthwhile. In the Old Testament we read this: "For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it." What a lovely ideal for us to follow. And in the Doctrine and Covenants (132:3) the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith: - "Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you." I think to prepare one's heart is perhaps the most decisive point in progress toward any goal. Carrying out one's plans and good intentions, of course, is important, too, but the action is comparatively easy once the heart is thoroughly prepared for that course. As the poem says, "It's the set of the soul that determines the goal." So far as living the gospel is concerned, I firmly believe we can do the things we want to do, if the desire is strong enough. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 In our Relief Society organization we have much help in preparing our hearts to do good. Our wonderful lessons and work meeting activities give us great help. But we not only have help in preparing our own hearts, but we have the opportunity to help others in preparing their hearts. Visiting teaching gives us a fine opportunity of turning the hearts of inactive Church members, little by little, back to activity. It ls within our power to show the joy of service and the beauties of the gospel to those who are engrossed in worldly affairs. A bishop recently made a special plea that Relief Society members put their arms around our sisters who have drifted away and estranged themselves from the Church because they have married outsiders. Through sheer love and personal interest, we should endeavor to draw them to our organization and thus to activity in the gospel. Living the gospel means sharing it with as many others as possible, doesn't it? And visiting teaching ls indeed a challenge in sharing the gospel. 'True, every home cannot be approached in the same manner, and this is why visiting teaching requires such thought, such preparation, tact, and prayer. Remember, if you are too busy to serve the Lord, you are too busy. Prepare your hearts to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and in every way possible help others to prepare their hearts for nighteousness. May our Heavenly Father help us to set our course in the right direction and follow it with determination. Ready for Christmas Ora Pate Stewart T was three days before Christmas, but Emmy was ready. Always, the day after Christmas, she could be seen crocheting a fine edge on a white handkerchief, pulling threads on a scarf for a bit of Swedish darning, or sewing small cross stitches into a sampler or cushion—so that she'd be ready by the next Christmas. "It's not like I make a burden of it," she would explain, and her sharp dark eyes would sparkle with spirit. "I may not be so young, but I still enjoy the giving end," she would continue. And sometimes she would add, "There are richer folks, but giving has never been a burden to me." It was true. She was old, if you looked in the family Bible and counted up her eighty-six years. And she could have been considered poor, if you insisted that old coal stoves and worn linoleum floors were the badges of that modest economy. But she gave, and the burden was never evident. She didn't give just to the needy. I'm sure I didn't need the towel she gave me one year with crocheted colored flowers spilling out from a crocheted basket. And yet, every time I come across that towel, now faded and frayed, something pleasant rises up within me like the scent of old spice. It puts the world in better tune, and points up the corners of my spirits. I needed that, and I guess she knew it. Notwithstanding her years and the circle of braided white hair that framed her slender face, she was Emmy to everyone. Tots were coached to address her as Grandma Emmy, and youthful friends sometimes referred to her as Aunt Emmy. But Emmy she was, and only the postman and the tax collector shared any dim remembrance of a surname. With her lived her widowed daughter, who had made room for her son and his wife, whose three children had been born there. And _ hers was the only house I have ever seen homing four generations in_harmony. Emmy was not wholly crippled. Her hands were gnarled with arthritis, and there were indications that other junctions of her anatomy were similarly afflicted. But she had maintained a discipline over tightening joints, and the pattern of her artistic soul was still transmitted straight and true through her crooked fingers. Years before a stroke had invaded one side of her face, clasping one
