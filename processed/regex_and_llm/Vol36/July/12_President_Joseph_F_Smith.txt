Edgar Lyon URING our studies last year we learned of the activities of the five First Presidencies of the Church that served from 1833 to 1901. These studies should have taught us two fundamental concepts. 'The first is that in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with no professionally trained Priesthood, there is need for presiding quorums. In our studies we learned that the Lord had established the First Presidency of the Church as the Presidency of all of the Priesthood and Church members throughout the world. Functioning as a unit, the members of this Presidency have directed all the many different types of Church activities, both in times of stress and in times of peace. The second idea presented to us was that the Lord raised up men at the various stages of development and growth of the Church who were able to give the Church the leadership it needed at that particular time. We sing, "God moves in a mysterious way, his wonders to per- 496 form," and we see this made a reality in the study of the accomplishments of the various First Presidencies of the Church. So unified in purpose and devotion have the members of these Presidencies been, that it is almost impossible to designate or classify the accomplishments of an_individual member of a Presidency. Through counsel and co-operation, they have worked to accomplish those things that were needful for the welfare of the kingdom of God on earth. Unselfishly, each member of a Presidency has worked for the good of the whole Church, not for position, honor, or power for himself. No great man has ever achieved success entirely alone. He may be singled out for his accomplishments and his aides remain unnamed, but they were nevertheless important contributors to his success. So it is in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The President is recognized as the leader, but he leans heavily upon his counselors. It should, therefore, be remembered that although we speak of the administration of a President of the Church, we are aware of the great assistance rendered by the unnamed counselors in the First Presidency, without whose aid the President might have been seriously handicapped. The Lord has stood by and RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 blessed those who have served in the First Presidencies of the Church. They have accomplished _ great things in the earth. Just as the early leaders were blessed, so have been those who followed them. Individuals selected to this presiding quorum since the beginning of this century have been equally blessed with those who preceded them. Each has filled his position with honor and efficiency. This year we shall study the administrations of Presidents Joseph F. Smith, Heber J. Grant, and George Albert Smith, and see how God utilizes mortals to accomplish his purposes. The following are the titles of the lessons for the coming year: Lesson 8. President Joseph F. Smith Lesson 9. The Counselors to President Joseph F. Smith Lesson 10. President Heber J.

LESSON DEPARTMENT 497 Lesson 8—President Joseph F. Smith (1901-1918) (Primarily for use outside Continental United States and its possessions) T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, October 25, 1949 Tue PREesiweNcy A Untr—THE TureE ARE ONE HEN the passing of President _ Lorenzo Snow disorganized the First Presidency in 1901, the man chosen to succeed him as President was well qualified for this highest calling. He was Joseph F. Smith, a son of Hyrum Smith, the martyred patriarch of the Church. He was born at Far West, Missouri, on November 13, 1838. He passed his early years in Nauvoo, Illinois, and remembered well the departure of his father and his uncle, the Prophet Joseph Smith, for Carthage, that fateful June day in 1844. After the exodus from Nauvoo in 1846, he remained at Winter Quarters, Nebraska, with his widowed mother until the spring of 1848. 'Then, being still in his ninth year, he drove an ox team across the prairies and mountains to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, arriving there in September. He participated in the usual hard work of pioneering in a new land, and had the tragic experience of losing his mother when only fourteen years of age. At the age of fifteen he was sent on a mission to the Hawaiian Islands (Sandwich Islands) which was the beginning of his active service in Church leadership. From that day until his death, sixty-five years later, he was almost constantly engaged in full-time service to the Church. He was ordained an apostle in PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH 1866 by Brigham Young and also as counselor to the First Presidency. In 1869, at a conference in Juab, Utah, Wilford Woodruff introduced Joseph F. Smith, and then said to the young people present: Look at him, children, for he resembles the Prophet Joseph more than any man living. He will become the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints (Wilford Woodruff, page 536). This prediction was ultimately realized, but not until many years later. During those years, however, he was an earnest worker in the Church. In the former lessons we learned that this man of unusual ability served as a counselor in the First Presidency to Presidents John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and Lorenzo Snow. In this capacity he 498 traveled extensively throughout the wards and stakes of the Church and in the mission fields, giving counsel concerning temporal and _ spiritual matters, and exercising supetvisory control over many phases of Church activity. When the First Presidency was reorganized in 1901, there thus came to its Presidency the first President born within the Church. We learned in the lessons last year of the serious financial condition which faced the Church in its pioneer period and later in the days of its long and intense struggle with the Federal Government concerning its political, civil, and_ religious rights. President Snow had already called upon the people to rededicate themselves to the temporal salvation of the Church, and had them pledge themselves to observe the law of tithing. President Joseph F. Smith had been closely associated with President Snow in this work, and continued to emphasize this teaching. It appeared to him that setting in order the temporal affairs of the Church was a most pressing need, and he gave of his strength and vigor to place it on a secure footing. So well did he succeed in this that, by 1907, he was able to announce that the bonded indebtedness of the Church had been paid off and the Church could meet its current obligations. Under his able leadership, the Church then commenced an extensive building program. Many ward chapels and stake tabernacles were built and mission homes and chapels in the mission fields were purchased or erected. President Smith was a man of great feeling and sentiment, and he turned his attention to the task of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 securing some of the locations that were closely connected with the eatly history of the Church. The old Smith homestead in Vermont-— the birthplace of the Prophet Joseph Smith—was acquired, and a great symbolic monument was erected there. Other sacred or historical shrines were acquired in New York, Missouri, and Illinois. The first hospital was erected by the Church in Salt Lake City—the forerunner of the large number that now dot Latter-day Saint communities. The beautiful Church Office Building was commenced in Salt Lake City and the Presiding Bishop's Building was completed to house the temporal offices of the Church and the rapidly expanding auxiliary organizations. Land was also acquired and dedicated for the temples in Hawaii and Canada. The Church school system was also expanded. President Smith had a broad vision of the destiny of the Church. He was aware that if the Church was to grow and increase in the earth so that it could fulfill its destiny, it must be firmly established not only in the hearts of its converts and members, but also in the eyes of non-members. His inspirational insight led him to see that the Church must acquire the respect of the world and become a dynamic force for righteous leadership and thereby "come forth out of obscurity and out of darkness," as the Lord had commanded that it should (D. & C. 1:30). President Smith declared: It has always been a cardinal teaching with the Latter-day Saints, that a religion that has not the power to save people temporally and make them _ prosperous and happy here, cannot be depended upon to save them spiritually and to exalt LESSON DEPARTMENT them in the life to come (Heart of Mormonism, page 158). In this statement he was reiterating the teachings that the Prophet Joseph Smith had given to his people in Missouri and later in Illinois, The Latter-day Saint, according to the first Prophet of this dispensation, is living in eternity each day of his life, just as much as any day that is to follow either after death or following the resurrection. Therefore, the temporal and the spiritual Phases of life cannot be separated, nor should an attempt be made to view them as distinct entities, The tremendous energy that President Smith exerted to accomplish these many achievements was strongly supported by those able men who stood by him as his counselors in the First Presidency. We shall learn of them in our lesson next month. President Smith's time was not all consumed with attention to the temporal well-being of the rapidly expanding Church. He gave to the Church an era of powerful spiritual leadership. In 1906, the saints of Europe rejoiced in the presence of President Smith. This was the first time the European Mission had been visited by a President of the Church while holding that office. As he traveled up and down the Church, visiting at conferences, Preaching in the annual and semiannual conferences, talking at funerals and public gatherings and writing short articles for the various Church Publications, he set 4 pattern of great spirituality, Everywhere he went he bore testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ and the validity of his atoning sacrifice. 499 Many people had become so busily engaged in everyday activities that they and their children had commenced to lose sight of the fact that One cannot work out his salvation alone for, without the atonement, one's efforts would be futile. Presjdent Smith devoted much of his spiritual teachings to calling this essential doctrine to Church members' attention. Another item of great importance for which the Church is indebted to him relates to his knowledge and statements concerning the work and character of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, who was President Smith's father. He never tired of bearing testimony of the divinity of Joseph Smith's work. His personal reminiscences of his father and martyred uncle also held his audiences in Tapt attention. The accounts he related of the Prophet's humanity, his forgiving spirit, his sense of humor, his utter devotion to the cause of the Lord and his unselfishness, are among the literary treasures of the Church. It is related that sometime before his death he made the observation that, unlike some of his predecessors in the First Presidency, when he passed into the hereafter he would leave behind no written volume of theological expositions, no scriptural contributions or no poetic literature: or hymnology. Some of those who heard this questioned that his life had been so devoid of literary Productiveness, and they set themselves to the task of gathering his spoken and printed works. To their astonishment they found a vast amount of material and from this selected and airanged the volume 500 ee ' 3 50% Wool Batt. ¢ 72 x 90-inch $1.79 Blend of soft, long-fibered wool and fluffy cotton, makes up into lovely comforters. =n ena SEAR CLASS LEADERS here are your reference texts Joseph Smith: Prophet-Statesa$2.25 Dr. G.

Main Salt Lake City 4, Utah RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 known as Gospel Doctrine. This book is highly prized by Church members and is a printed testimony of the spiritual strength and leadership of President Smith. A study of the topical arrangement of this book indicates that he not only preached doctrines that dealt with the more formal phases of religion, but that he had a deep understanding of the intimate needs of people. He spoke of love, court: ship, marriage, family life, rearing of children, training in habits of good living, character development, the evils of divorce and unchastity, the need to preach the gospel by example as well as by precept, generosity, forgiveness, and many other subjects. 'These he related to daily gospel living. Not only did he preach on these subjects, but he manifested the realization of them in his own daily living and in the lives of his family. There are many people alive today who can still bear testimony of acts he performed which exemplified these qualities. He loved his family and stressed the responsibility of parents to win the love, confidence, and admiration of their children. When he met members of his family on the street, in a public gathering or in any other place he embraced and kissed them. Children were to him, as Jesus said, akin to the kingdom of heaven and he loved them all, his own and others too. It is related that at one time during an important meeting with business men from the eastern part of the United States, the door opened and a little child walked into the office. President Smith took the child on his lap and talked to it in sub- LESSON DEPARTMENT dued tones, kissed and held it until it desired to slip to the floor and leave the room. The eastern visitors were astonished. 'They asked if it were his youngest child. He replied that it wasn't his. He did not know whose child it was. It had apparently come with its mother to the Church office, and wandered away from her while she was busy.
