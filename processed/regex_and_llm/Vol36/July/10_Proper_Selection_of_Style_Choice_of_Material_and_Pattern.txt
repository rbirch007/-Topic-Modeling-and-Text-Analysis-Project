at it is narrowing in its influence, and that it is sinful to enjoy the delights which are to be found in this world. Christ showed us that the religious life is the abundant life. He came not to restrict us in our enjoyments of life, but to add to them. It should not be necessary to for- 480 bid an intelligent man to do harmful things. He ought to avoid them because he has no taste for them, because he finds more real satisfaction and more enduring pleasure in the doing of things that are recreational, but harmless in their nature, or by engaging in constructive activities. One might well ask, why should one choose a life that is small and contracted when there is within his RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 reach the life that is full and complete? How often have we heard missionaries speak of the time spent in the mission field as the happiest one of their lives? It is because they have discovered how completely satisfying their lives could become when they were experiencing the joys of the spirit. This broader existence is the one that Christ brought to light when he came, that we might have life and have it more abundantly. ><> WVork ITleeting—Sewing Children's Clothing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Preview of Lessons for 1949-50 VERY Latter-day Saint woman should acquire enough sewing skill to do the simple tasks required of a homemaker. There are always hems to adjust, seams to be let out or taken in, collars to be turned, or some household article to be made. There are still many women who need our help in learning to do these simple things. We feel that Relief Society has a definite responsibility to see that every woman is encouraged to participate actively in the sewing program of the society that her skill may be increased and that she may be of service in helping others. We suggest that special instruction be given in sewing again this season. A course in making children's clothing is outlined with the idea of meeting the needs of many of our young mothers. There is great satisfaction in being able to make clothing for our children both from the creative and the financial standpoint. The designing and making of children's apparel has come to be a specialized field. 'The chubby child and the more slender one wear very different models. What mother does not look with longing eyes at the exclusive models featured in children's shops? The purchase price, however, is more than most family budgets can allow but, with a little instruc tion in basic sewing, we can make things just as becoming and usually better fitting. What mother's heart does not thnill to hear her youngster boast proudly, "My mother made this." We hope that the membership of this class will not be limited to younger women. Those who have sewed for families now grown can be of great help to our younger sisters if LESSON DEPARTMENT they will come and work with them. Then, too, there are many grandmothers who will appreciate learning the little touches which will enable them to make an appreciated gift for a beloved grandchild. We feel that there are wonderful possibilities for the wards in following this course, and we hope that enthusiastic work meeting leaders will make the most of these lessons. The titles of the lessons for 1949- 50 are as follows: 48] Lesson 1. Proper Selection of Style, Choice of Material and Pattern Lesson 2. Layettes and Baby Sewing Lesson 3. Play Clothes Lesson 4. Underwear and Nightwear Lesson 5. Girls' Clothing Lesson 6. Boys' Clothing Lesson 7. Coats and Snowsuits Lesson 8. Display of Children's Clothing. Lesson 1—Proper Selection of Style, Choice of Material and Pattern For Tuesday, October 11, 1949 Jean Ridges Jennings NE cannot stress too much the importance of careful consideration of the problem of making clothes for children. It is important in the extreme that women understand and apply the principles involved in the proper selection and construction of apparel for our young people. Psychologists today believe that clothing definitely affects the behavior of a child. Dull, drab, ugly clothes are likely to reflect their ugliness in a child's disposition. Attractive clothes help to make children happier as well as to help them develop good taste early in life. Clothing is a fundamental factor in character building. A child dressed in simple, serviceable, comfortable, and artistic clothes naturally develops an appreciation of these qualities. Whenever you anticipate getting wearing apparel for a child, ask yourself these questions about it: Will the garments be harmful in any way? Are they protective? Will they be enjoyed? Are they becoming and attractive? Are they suitable in every respect? No garment is proper if it interferes in any way with the welfare of the child. The style of dressing a child changes as he grows older, but the underlying principles of selection remain the same. Clothes should be chosen with a view to suiting the child's personality. His physical characteristics of coloring and type must be taken into consideration, as well as his habits of action. Dressing a sturdy youngster in pale blue or the pale, delicate, timid child in bright red does not bring out the characteristics of either child. The pale child should wear colors, not of the same pale value but of just enough difference to call attention to the child. The quaint, prim little girl wears soft clinging dresses with ruffles and embroidery. She is always immacu- 482 late and sits around with not too much activity. Her tomboy sister is sturdy and active and would be out of place in the same soft clothes. She is better suited with sturdier, plainer, more durable dresses. The pattern or design in the material itself should also be becoming to a girl. Delicately flowered designs become the smaller children, while bolder prints would be appropriate for sturdy types. It is often difficult to obtain the exact pattern size for children. To avoid losing much time making alterations when sewing, carefully RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 take the child's measurements and compare them with those of the pattern being used. Always take measurements of chest, underarm length, and back length. Even after buying a pattern that presumably fits your child's measurements, it is wise to compare the actual pattern pieces for size with a garment that is made and fits. Make pattern alterations for size in the pattern itself before cutting material. Time spent in careful consideration of choice of pattern and material to suit the child and his needs is time well spent. _- S iterature—The Literature of England Preview of Lessons for 1949-50 N considering the course in literature for 1949-50, the general board has deemed it advisable to postpone the study of Latter-day Saint literature of the pioneer and contemporary periods. Instead, it has been decided to undertake a course of study of English literature beginning with the earliest English literature and progressing on to American literature in chronological sequence. One of the important objectives of the general board, in presenting this year's literature course, is to point out the characteristics of great literature and, from a study of some of the best in literature, to gain a greater appreciation of its value. Today the market is flooded with quantities of inferior reading material. What to read presents a real problem. A good basis for selection is needed. It is hoped that this course will help to give Latter-day Saint women a sense of discrimination, that they may not only recognize and know the best in literature, but desire to read the best, as well. Just what is great literature? How can it be recognized? What are its essentials? Literature might be defined as a "mirror that walks along the highway," reflecting our
