off and the wires sagging, with the result that the climbing roses and Virginia creeper are literally crawling out into the alley in search of something on which to drape their foliage. Here, a neat stone wall would create a miracle of durability and beauty. If you are a trifle hesitant about your ability to undertake such a task, just keep in mind a few basic rules, then remember the vines will cover up the wall, anyway. So a wall may be the very place for your first effort. Make sure you have a durable rooting, deep enough to be below the frost line, and wide enough to give the wall the rigidity necessary to withstand any of the ordinary forces of nature without crackPage 466 ing or sagging. The width of the footing may be about two feet, and the depth an equal distance from the surface, with the actual thickness of the footing from eight to twelve inches. The footing should be level and so completely tied together by cement as to constitute a solid slab. Then, with trowel and mortar, using also a line and plumb bob, you are ready to do the actual building of the wall. One of the most interesting projects to undertake without a high degree of skill in masonry, is laying a flagstone courtyard or patio. This might well unite the house with an outdoor fireplace, the latter also to be built with the same design and materials. This undertaking may expand into an outdoor living room, with rustic furniture and, if possible, a huge flagstone table properly mounted on a solid base. The fireplace naturally becomes the center of many outdoor activi- 'ties, such as marshmallow roasts and picnics. With the table handy, it is always easy to serve a complete meal if desired. If the wings of the fireplace are designed to be hollow, they make excellent storage places for wood and, by covering the top of the wings also with smooth slabs of rocks, you get extra table space for pans and dishes. Your flagstone yard, built in this way, should be sloped sufficiently to make drainage swift and complete. And, after the very first tones ate to be §°0d cement The floor the air.

SALADS OF INFINITE VARIETY mental principles, always to be observed. 'The salad greens should be washed and placed to crisp in the icebox several hours before using. Lettuce should be broken in pieces by hand. Garlic, just a hint, enhances the flavor of any green salad. If you possess a wooden bowl, and every salad lover should have one, cut a clove of garlic in half and rub a piece around the bowl until it disappears into the wood. Next arrange your greens. You may make a border of lettuce leaves, endive, or romaine tips. In the center you may have an escarole heart, flanked by lettuce or other greens, or you may toss your greens indiscriminately. On top, arrange the sliced onions, tomatoes (cut lengthwise for retaining the juice), green peppers, or whatever vegetables you care to use. Place a scattering of finely chopped or cut herbs on top. My favorites are chives, parsley, thyme, and basil. Basil I use always with tomatoes, but the others may be used separately or together with almost any combination. Now, place a damp cloth over the bowl and put it in the icebox until it is ready to be used on the table. If you are a perfectionist, you will toss the salad at the table. That leads directly to the matter of dressing. No two cooks ever mix a dressing the same way. The old standard recipe calls for two tablespoonfuls. Of oil to one of vinegar. My recipe is this: In a small bottle I place a generous dash of salt, a small dash of cayenne pepper, and paprika, and a larger dash of mustard. To this I add a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of 469 Tabasco sauce. I may also add some celery seeds and a little chili powder or about a half-teaspoon of chili sauce. 'To this I add the oil, two generous teaspoonfuls to a person, and one of vinegar. I usually add an extra teaspoon of lemon juice Then I put the lid on the bottle and shake it until the contents are beautifully blended. If I am not using a garlic-rubbed bowl, I take part of a garlic clove and place it in the bottle. 'Then I chill the contents, remembering to shake the bottle well before I pour it over the greens. For tossing, I prefer a wooden fork and spoon, and the salad is turned until every morsel is coated with the dressing. To the bowl of salad greens and tomatoes, you may add tiny marbles of cream cheese, mixed with herbs, or sprinkle the greens generously with fresh grated Parmesan cheese, a few anchovies, or stuffed eggs. If you wish a cooked vegetable salad of carrots, artichoke hearts, peas, cauliflowers, string beans, or zucchini, these should be marinated in dressing before using. For a zestful salad, add a tiny bit of minced mint and thyme to the peas. You may use minced thyme, parsley, summer savory, or chives with the other vegetables. Avocados should be cubed or sliced and sprayed with lemon juice, their flavor is heightened by the use of onions and sliced oranges or grapefruit. Fruits, added to a tossed salad, give piquancy and add vitamins. Slices or chunks of pineapple, fresh or canned, are good with greens and cheese balls, or with the vegetable combinations. Seedless grapes stimulate the taste in almost any variant of the tossed salad. You may mix into the salad paper-thin slices of apple, with the red peel left on for firmness and color.

Again this yeat only one chaptet of the text will be treated in each lesson. Sure that experience has strated that each chaptet provides sufficient material to occupy the class period. Class leaders are urged also to study references at the end of each chapter and secure authentic enrichment material wherever available. _Howevet, the discussion should be confined to the subject matter of the lesson. It is doubtful if any other period in the world's history ever neede the true Christian way of life as does the one in which we ate living. 'This year's course will deal largely with doctrines of the Church as they were taught by during the closing months personal ministry on earth. 'The women of Relief Society will be givcn opportunity fo study these doctrines; and it ls earnestly hoped that this study will awaken in the heart of each sister 4 desire not only to live personally the gospel of the Redeemer, but also to aid in bringing others to see the true light. The objective will be to show the way of life as Jesus taught it that we Page 4712 may patter our lives more closely This course follows closely the text Jesus the Christ. 'The events in the Savior's life are treated in the same chronological order as in the text, and each lesson covers many different subjects. The objectives given at the beginning of each lesson ale, therefore, general in nature. Questions are given at the end of each lesson. It is suggested that class leaders use these questions to aid in obtaimng class participation and discussion as the lesson is being presented. Again, the titles of the chapters of the text have been used as the titles of the lessons. For the 1949 50 season WE shall study chapters 25 to 32 inclusive, and the titles and objectives of the lessons follow: Lesson 17. Jesus Again in Jerusalem," chapter 25. Objective: To increase faith in the Lord Jesus by a careful study of some of his wonderful teachings. Lesson 18. "Our Lord's Ministry in Perea and Judea," chapter 26.

The Feast f Weeks or 474 It was both a memorial and a yearly harvest celebration at which ll males in Israel were required to "appear before the Lord in formal celebration," that is, to appear or attend in the court of the tabernacle or temple and "make his offering with a joyful heart" (Smith's Bible Dictionary, page 192). Many of the Saviors brethren urged that he should go to a more prominent place than Galilee to display his powers; but not through zeal for his divine mission, for we are expressly told they did not believe in him. When he refused to let them direct his movements, he took occasion to tell them of the difference between their status and his. He was not of the world as they were. The world hated him because he was not of it, and, therefore, he was rejected by those who were of the world. At the Feast of Tabernacles There was great interest in Jerusalem concerning Jesus. Many people believed he was a good man, although many disputed this, and all seemed to be afraid to espouse his cause openly for fear of incurring the displeasure of the rulers. Jesus decided to go to the Feast of the Tabernacles at Jerusalem and, probably on the third or fourth day, he appeared. As usual, he soon began to teach the people. Evidently he surprised the teachers. 'They asked among themselves: "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" He was no graduate of their schools, nor had he sat at the feet of the rabbis. Note his answer: "... My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself" (John 7:16-17). Thus he revealed his teacher—the great Eternal Father. 'The test he gave was eminently fair. It is fair today. Do his will and we shall know. Jesus honored his great 'Teacher—his God—and, therefore, he was free from selfish pride and boastfulness. The rulers had tried especially to convict the Lord on two charges, breaking the Sabbath and _ blasphemy. It will be recalled he had healed an afflicted man on the Sabbath. Jesus now referred to this act of mercy, saying: "I have done one work and ye all marvel." The rulers were in doubt as to whether they should accept him for the miracle or reject him because he had performed the miracle on the Sabbath. He confounded them when he showed that the law of Moses expressly allowed acts of mercy on the Sabbath. "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment" (John 7:24). Strange how prone men are to misjudge. All the works of Jesus were good and many people were beginning to believe in him. When the chief priests realized this, they sent officers to arrest him and bring him before their high court—the Sanhedrin. The Master, however, continued his discourse, telling the people that he would be with them only for a short time; and that he would then return to the Father. Always his remarks that he came from the Father and would return to him caused bitter discussion. 'The people would not accept his doc- Pr OEE, II, ay aay odes ay SIGE ate age FOR, x ¢ Pa Bi ol oy: 3 oe Leyte A Perry Picture From a Painting by Hofmann CHRIST AND THE SINNER Page 475 476 trine that he was from God—a part of the Godhead. Many of the plain people were impressed with Jesus and declared he was the Messiah. The technical objectors quibbled over his coming from Galilee. They argued that the Messiah was to come from Bethlehem of Judea. How easy it is when one wants to find an excuse for not obeying! When the police officers returned without Jesus and acknowledged they had been impressed by his teachings, their masters were furious. They asked of the officers, "Are ye also deceived?" (John 7:47). These arrogant rulers were concemed, however, with the opinion of the common people, and because of this fear were stopped again in their evil course. The only man in the Sanhedrin who voiced any comment in favor of the Lord was Nicodemus, who had _ previously come personally to Jesus by night to inquire into his teachings (John 3:1-21). "Go, and Sin No More" Shortly after the festival, Jesus went one morning to the temple and began teaching one of the groups that gathered about him. Here occurred an event of outstanding importance which illustrated his capacity as a teacher and judge. While he was talking, a party of scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who, they charged, was guilty of adultery. Her guilt seems to have been admitted. The law of Moses required that such crimes should be punished by having the guilty one stoned to death, although this extreme penalty had long since been RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 abandoned. Thinking to ensnare the Lord, the scribes and Pharisees asked, "But what sayest thou?" Had he decreed the death penalty, it would have been against the law of the Romans, since power to inflict the death penalty had been taken from all Jewish tribunals and adultery was not a capital offense under Roman rule. If the judgment were to release her with little or no punishment, Jesus would have distegarded the law of Moses. These wicked rulers thought they had Jesus trapped. For awhile he seemed to disregard their demands and then said, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." That was the law. Jesus began writing on the ground. The woman's accusers slunk away. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more (John 8:10-11). While the Lord declined to condemn her to death, he sent her away with the solemn warning to repent and lead a better life. The Light of the World The Master Teacher moved to another part of the temple court and, seeing the great lamps, continued his teaching, saying: " I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (John 8-12). It was another way of telling them again that he was the Son of God—the giver of light and life. He did not often stop to argue; he proclaimed. He told them that he was guided by the Father who had LESSON DEPARTMENT he Prophets were dead and Jesus f te is thy h d dared to Say that al] who obeyed ather?"
