THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 36, NO. 7., — JULY 1949 Pioneer INlother Ruth H. Chadwick She held him close to nestle near her breast, And tried to hush each fitful baby moan; Tenderly, her aching arms caressed The thin, frail body, hot against her own. Into the blackened strangeness of the night, Beyond the covered wagons' friendly sphere, She gazed as lurking shadows grew in might To feed her soul's anxiety and fear. Her sleepless eyes then sought the stars above, And silent words made up her anguished prayer: "Oh, Father, spare this dear one that I love, And make me strong to carry my full share." She held him close, and from her stalwart soul Flowed living faith that blessed and made him whole. The Cover: "Pioneer Women at the Gate," Photograph by Willard Luce. Warren Lee UTAH STATE CAPITOL For Those Who Come After Anna Prince Redd ULY Twenty-fourth... Pioneer J Day in Utah... From hamlet to city, throngs line the thoroughfares. It is a holiday, a gala day! One hundred and two years have passed since that first small band of men and three women entered the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. One hundred and two years of almost unbelievable progress! Thousands stand sweltering in the heat, waiting for the commemorating parade, heads bared to the flag and acutely conscious of the freedoms for which it stands. Pretense and folly are lost, for the moment, in reverence. Eyes are alight with pride and the spark of renewed ideals. The throat tightens as the parade, a colorful and symbolic pageant, moves down the street, historically depicting the scenes and achievements of the past. And we of the present generation can but stand and watch—and measure the adequacy of the present. Handcarts... I cannot follow them down the street. I cannot see them for my tears. "Come, Come, Ye Saints" That song is the embodiment of faith and the prayers that brought our people here. The cords of restraint all but snap, for to me it is my own parents singing It is their story I relive today we OK OK ok INTER came early in the year 1857. Almost before the fall days were done there was a heavy frost and the world seemed enveloped in a damp, thick blanket of fog. Every day it grew colder. Trees cracked in their bark and the sound was like ice popping on the Virgin River. The dampness penetrated every cranny of house and _ body. Cattle died on the range and corral stock could stand only by leaning against inadequate shelters and fences. 'The people, reduced to smutty flour for their coarse bread, with little milk or fruit, became inert like the half-frozen animals. But with the first intimation of spring the natural resilience of the pioneers called forth new courage, as surely as the warming of the sun called forth new grass. And, because horses were too poor for travel, a pioneer boy began a thirty-five-mile walk to the town where his sweetheart lived. The dawn was still raw with cold, but the air was freighted with the scent of coming buds and thawing ground. It was a good world. It made a man feel strong and free. Twelve hours later, in the welcoming, mild dusk, he swung in long strides up the street and to the house of the girl he loved. Together, they welcomed spring. Because of their distance from the Endowment House, they were married the next day by the girl's reluctant father and, in a borrowed wagon, drawn by a borrowed team, they began the journey to the town that was to be their new home. The boy had exactly a dollar and eightyfive cents. The girl had two dollars and a half, a chest packed to its bulging lid with homespuns, rugs, a Page 435 436 meager assortment of cooking utensils and dishes, and a few small packets of sugar, sage, and thyme. And, stowed carefully into the back of the wagon, was a small four-lid cookstove, her dead mother's most prized possession, now the binding link between the old life and the new for the young bride. The joint heritage of both the boy and the girl was an unshaken faith in the goodness of life and their part in it. Two days of creaking, jolting travel and the borrowed team pulled the borrowed wagon into the yard of the borrowed dugout that was to be their first home. The sun had gone down in a blaze of orange light. Strange sounds filled the twilight, sounds that saddened the girl by their unfamiliarity since they were part of the unknown that lay ahead. The boy turned the homemade key in the handmade lock, and they went into the windowless little dugout. And suddenly, because they were together, it became home. THERE followed days, weeks, and months of hardship and privation—drought, snakes, insects, hunger, fear. Sometimes, even doubt. A son was born, too frail and weak to survive in his rigid surroundings. There was little but faith left, yet it was enough to heal their sorrow and send them in search of a new and better location. The boy, in the new settlement, was assigned his section of land, did his allotted rods of fencing in the company plot, worked and prayed, fought Indians, guarded the fort; dreamed and waited for the good future he knew would be theirs. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 The girl, pressing back fatigue, hunger, fear, and sorrow, kept her faith, too. And she kept her smile and her love for her husband. "T see a little light," she would tell him, "we'll be prosperous some day, I have no doubt; but never more blessed than we are now. We'll have other children—sons and daughters who will be faithful and happy. All that we do now is for them." And the boy agreed. For, by then, they had a home, a garden, milk, and honey. And none of it was borrowed. Surely, God had been good to them. Then came another spring and another little new son. A strong boy, equal to his surroundings, beautiful as their faith. Then, as if to test them, they were called to help colonize in a high, cold climate that was foreign to them and seemingly barren of promise. But neither faltered. The boy left the girl to care for the little new son while he went ahead to prepare a home in the new place. The summer was hot and long. 'The girl and her baby were stricken with measles. Denied water to cool the fever and with little care by the frightened neighbors, who knew there was little they could do to stop the ravages of any disease, th
