the State emblem, in the corner where the southwestern part of Wyoming joins Utah. The State is made in blue cloth on a white background, with the historical figures designed in gold-colored material. The figures and events pictured include the Angel Moroni delivering the golden plates to the Prophet Joseph Smith; a covered wagon, symbolizing the long trek from Nauvoo, Illinois, to the mountain valleys; crickets and seagulls in the fields; the Brigham Young monument, and This Is the Place monument. Mrs. Thomas selected her designs from newspaper pictures and copied them with carbon paper. The stitching is done in diamond pattern for the center, bordered by a scroll design, and for the edge a leaf motif is stitched on the white cloth and the edges gracefully scalloped. The making of the quilt has given Mrs. Thomas, who is seventy-two years old, much pleasure, and she plans to use this handiwork as an heirloom to be handed down to her family. She writes: "I have made many beautiful quilts, have one on the frame now." Among her many other activities, Mrs. Thomas finds time to teach a Sunday School class and she has completed the genealogical research for thousands of names. Page 463 Lets Vary the Picnic Nenu Y Rachel K. Laurgaard Illustrations by Elizabeth Williamson ——_ are not the only "finger-foods" that can be served at a Fourth of July outing. Furthermore, potato salad is not the only hearty salad for a hungry group of picnickers. Here is a happy twosome that should be more widely known in this fair land of ours. Perhaps it is the name that baffles us. Pjiroskies are impossible to spell and still worse to pronounce, but they are delectable to eat—and not difficult to prepare. Let's let the Russians call them what they like—we can re-christen them '"Bomburgers'" and Americanize them as thoroughly as they deserve to be. They are a combination of hamburger and doughnut that adapts itself perfectly to picnics. In place of the ever-present potato salad, let's borrow from the French and serve vinaigrette. In spite of its fancy name, it is a plain and wholesome salad. On the Fourth we celebrate the founding of the "great melting pot"—the land that welcomes all races with their customs and their talents—and, incidentally, their foods— and makes them all Americans!

Make Use of the Rocks Ezra J. Poulsen DN this day of high prices it is well to remember that rocks are still cheap. If they are not already around under your feet, you will find plenty of them in some neighboring creek bottom or ledge. And they are abundantly useful around the home. If you are handy enough to use a trowel and mix a little cement mortar, you should not have any trouble finding plenty of projects for using rocks. They do well to line a small water ditch, both for artistic effect and for the conservation of moisture. They make the best of retaining walls, bird baths, flagstone walks, and foundations for small buildings. Perhaps the rear fence has fallen into discard, with the posts broken
