own selves and the story of man's probing of mind, heart, and spirit. One writer says, ""There are three essentials to great literature: first, the idea worth expressing; second, the technique to express it beautifully; and third, the sincerity to express it convincingly." Beginning this year, we will focus our attention on a study of English literature, which will be useful in LESSON DEPARTMENT the study of any literature. Our procedure will be sufficiently chronological to establish a sense of continuity. This approach will correlate the historical background with the written expression of the people. We shall see expressed the influence of Christianity upon early pagan beliefs, and the merging of the two, (noting some of the signs of the apostasy), and then pass on to great literature of a later date. In the words of our author, "Our course objective is: to earn and share that high pleasure which only literature and a sense of the past can give." The recommended textbook (The Literature of England, volume 1, Scott, Foresman and Co.) is one which would be a welcome addition to any library. It is a large book and, as stated in the preface of this third edition, "in planning the book it was not to be just another collection of... Readings but a carefully articulated interpretation and representation of English culture as expressed in English literature." The textbook for this two-year course begins with Beowulf and concludes with James Boswell and Richard B. Sheridan. The cost of the book is $4.50 ($4.75 postpaid) from the Deseret Book Company, 44 East South Temple, Salt Lake City. The text is rich in maps, each one of which is executed in a style characteristic of the period it represents, and the graphic illustrations, moreover, have been selected from contemporaneous sources, showing the life of each period of English history as it was seen by artists of the time. 483 There will be many gaps in this study of the history of English literature due to the brevity of time for the Relief Society course; however, the book provides excellent material for anyone desiring to round out her own appreciation through studying the text. From the first year of this survey of English literature, beginning with Beowulf and ending with 17th-century poetry, will come a greater appreciation of what is great in literature and a greater knowledge of the growth of literary forms. Certain authors and works which are considered in this bird's-eye view may be amplified further as the course continues. Material may also be found in encyclopedias, The Book of Knowledge, etc. The April 1949 National Geographic Magazine contains many beautiful pictures portraying incidents and characters in English life which will prove valuable for use by the class leader. | Stake and ward class leaders and mission Relief Society branch class leaders are urged to see that their textbooks are ordered soon to ensure satisfactory delivery. The titles of the eight lessons for the first year follow: Lesson 1. Early English Literature Lesson 2. Legends of Chivalry Lesson 3. Shakespeare Lesson 4. Francis Bacon Lesson 5. The English Bible (through the St. James Translation ) Lesson 6. John Milton Lesson 7. John Bunyan Lesson 8. 17th Century Poetry 484 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 ab, Mogaiine—alie Literature of England Introduction Briant Jacobs S Robert Louis Stevenson teminded us as children: The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings. One of these happiest "things" of life is to share with others that which we have found to be good. For us the best in life is to share the best; this, in part, we are about to do. And if, in bringing this literature to you sisters, you maintain some fraction of the joy we feel in assisting you in this magnificant task, our desires shall not have been in vain. Now, a word about method. There are many trails through this rich wood; how you get within doesn't matter so much as that you do. If, in grazing this lush slope, we suggest that you eat only the tangy huckleberry, while in your own meanderings you have found some delicate grasses or aromatic mountain flowers—don't _ hesitate. On this range, bewilderment comes not from sparsity of feed, but from the very richness and variety of choice. Because a year's Relief Society course in literature is less than eight hours, sometimes we might appear to be in a hurry. Don't let us hurry you. Should we suggest you read four authors in an hour and, in discussing the first selection, you succeed rather well in making him come alive to your group until their faces glow as does yours—don't stop abruptly and feel you must hurry on to discuss the other three. Literature lives through creating and sharing a few intense experiences. Once you have caught some of the power, the beauty, the individuality of an author because you have been successful in enabling him to speak for himself with a part of his original force and freshness, you have accomplished something singularly worthwhile. But now it is time we begin—together. Lesson 1—Early English Literature Briant Jacobs For Tuesday, October 18, 1949 THE thrill of discovering an arrowhead beneath a sagebrush or a stone includes within itself these questions: Who last held this flint in his palm, as now it rests in mine? Who was he? How did he talk, and laugh? What, for him, was joy, or greatness, or fear? In what did he believe? Whatever sunken hulls or weapons, whatever cliff dwellings or castles the past has kindly preserved, LESSON DEPARTMENT these tell us relatively little. Until we can share with a people their words, or thought-symbols, we can know only a fraction of their most intimate and real selves. But once we are enabled to understand the writings of any age, its thoughts are ours and, at once, we possess the key to whatever mysteries, beauties, and beliefs motivated that culture. Beowulf It is fitting that the richest of all national literatures (the English) should begin with Beowulf, the earliest known sustained piece of writing in any modern language, and one of the important epics of all time. Although wntten by an unknown Anglo-Saxon poet about 750 A. D., Beowulf strictly belongs to no one nation. Its materials and tone brand it as a saga of the ancient Germanic heroic age, a pagan culture which had flourished in northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area since prehistoric times. Comparable to. Various Norse and Icelandic sagas, Beowulf nonetheless differs from them in two important trespects: (1) the author grafted onto the original many expressions of Christian virtues; (2) his brilliant and original use of language gives to Beowulf a sustained loftiness and dignity of tone which only great literature possesses. This greatest of all Old English poems is the outstanding example of the blending of the pagan and the Christian traditions. It also mixes history with legend: alongside such real episodes as funerals, 485 fights, and court banquets, appear Grendel, a supernatural mythical monster, and examples of epic exaggeration which to the literal-minded reader, might seem only preposterous. While the poem accepts God as ruler of the world, and mentions heaven and hell, the creation, Cain, and the deluge, it is dominated by Wyrd, pagan Goddess of Fate. Another pagan element is cremation. The payment of blood-money* is recounted and the worship of worldly glory and physical prowess. It reveals the Teutonic mind as moody, somber, and stubborn. Yet, despite a rough, savage existence, life was good, and courage, bravery, generosity, justice, and loyalty to clan and master were virtues most important in their vigorous code of life. The poem is divided into two parts. 'The first occurs at Heorot, the great hall built by Hrothgar, King of the Danes. Beowulf, a young Geat (probably from lower Sweden), fights the monster Grendel, who rises at night from the seamy moors to kill Hrothgar's warriors. Beowulf tears off Grendel's arm, then later, when Grendel's fiend-mother _returns to the hall, Beowulf pursues her to her den far beneath the sea where he slays her with a charmed sword. The second episode portrays the later years of Beowulf when, as King of the Geats, he attempts single-handed to slay a fierce dragon which threatens the welfare of his subjects. Mortally wounded in the struggle, Beowulf is rescued and defended by Wiglaf, one of his men. *This shows the early introduction of the false doctrine of doing penance by the payment of money, in place of the true doctrine of repentance taught by Christ. See Clark, J. Reuben, Jr., On the Way to Immortality and Eternal Life, page 232. 486 In deep mourning and devotion, the people bury him and honor his name. Note to Class Leaders: For the wealth of additional background material which cannot be included here, consult our text, The Literature of England, by Woods, Watts, and Anderson, particularly pp. 3-6, 9-10, 16-18, 19. The strength of language in Beowulf, and its exalted tone, can be imparted to your group only by reading aloud excerpts from the poem itself: the first 150 lines contain much that is both valuable and typical, as do lines 2205 to the end. It is obvious that your own exploring of the poem itself will prove a most fruitful investment of your study time. Use your own pronunciation of the proper nouns as they are not found in the dictionary. Bede (673-735) — | We might well be justified in saying that the Middle Ages was the Catholic church. For more than a thousand years during the dark days of the Great Apostasy, when men's minds were bound by ignorance, guidance flowed forth from the monasteries, the fountainheads of intellectual learning. From Jarrow (see map, opposite page 3 of the text) came the Venerable Bede (rhymes with seed), one of the greatest minds of the medieval world, and one of the great scholars of all time. Entering the monastery as an orphan of nine, Bede spent his entire life there. Largely because of him, Jarrow became the center of learning for all western Europe. The best mind of his age, a master of strong, clear prose as only one can be who devotes his life to reading and wniting, Bede did not aspire to create nor to entertain in his writings; like all religious writers of the Middle Ages, he desired only to reRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 cord events accurately and to teach the beauties of Christianity as understood in medieval times. Yet the beautiful prose style in which we read his Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, most important of his numerous works, is not entirely Bede's. Had not this work been translated from the Latin by Alfred the Great (849-901), the "presiding genius in Old English prose," it would not belong to this age so completely, nor would it mirror so precisely the literary and religious philosophies of these two genuinely great minds. As it is, these two scholars seem to have blended their personalities and skills most happily. From that day to the present, Bede's great literary style, characterized by simplicity, directness, human warmth, deep reverence and insight, and beauty of word and phrase, has been a model for historians and for all who would see life truly and who would write well. And the Venerable Bede is at his best in the Parable of the Swallow (page 64, lines 50-72), one of the loveliest parables outside the Bible. Primarily this parable is memorable because the image of the sparrow expresses with aptness and precision the mystery of this life and its relationship to immortality. The harmony between what is said and how Bede says it makes such writing literature. As we read further in Bede's Ecclesiastical History, more completely do we begin to understand why Bede has served as a model of English prose. "The Story of Caedmon" (pp. 65-67) proves once again Bede's ability to tell a story simply and purely. Immediately, we come to LESSON DEPARTMENT know Caedmon, not as a tender of horses, but as a modest soul humbly grateful to God for his power to praise him by re-creating the familiar stories of the Bible into poetry so beautiful and appealing as to ensure Caedmon's fame. As we witness Caedmon's receiving his poetic power, and when at death he expresses his feeling of "perfect charity" toward his fellows (page 66), we recognize the serenity of a soul at peace with self and God. The restrained telling of Caedmon's death gives us greater insight into Bede's own mind and beliefs, and hence tells us more about the Christian Anglo-Saxon's attitude toward God and this life than do volumes of facts. And this brief acquaintance with Bede and his depth of soul, as preserved for us in his prose, introduces us to an age which, because of such literature, can never die. Note to Class Leaders: If time permits, read "The Conversion of King Edwin" (pp. 63-65) aloud to your group, noting the humility of King Edwin, and the restraint of emotion and statement as we see Edwin, who "used to sit several hours alone, and seriously to ponder with himself what he was to do, and what religion he was to follow." Lines 50-72, page 64, at least, must be read aloud to your group. If for any reason you spoil the first reading, feel free to read it again, until at least part of its power has been communicated. For background study the text, Introductions to Chapters I and II, particularly pp. 12-17, 82-85, 101-103, as time permits. Geoffrey Chaucer (1340-1400) Study text, pp. 97-100, 209-211) With Chaucer the literature of the Middle Ages ends, and the literature of modern England begins. For centuries before Chaucer, and 487 during his own lifetime, writing was influenced by the Catholic church, which regarded literature as a tool useful in teaching religion, morality, and the virtues of the other-worldly life. While this tradition gave us a comprehensive and valuable body of religious writing, from Bede through Piers Plowman, English literature had never yet focused itself upon the realities of this life, while at the same time being free from the necessity of paying first honors either to religious, romantic, or legendary values. Likewise, the English language had never before been manipulated and shaped by a great literary artist; the language of the theologian and the scholar had been Latin. Not only did Chaucer liberate English literature and language from serving values other than its own, he also knew and loved and portrayed his fellow Englishmen so superbly that in a sympathetic evaluation of human nature only Shakespeare surpasses him. Despite whatever high seriousness his writing might lack, no exclusive list of the greatest English writers could ever exclude him. The son of an English wine merchant, Chaucer began his life at court as a page. While still a young man, he began making journeys to the Continent as a representative of England. Throughout his life he served the Crown substantially and well. His travels enabled him to know the cultures of France and Italy at firsthand; his lifelong love of French literature and the medieval romance proved to be a rich and deep vein from which he drew a sensitivity, a delicacy, a sparkling eye, and a deep-surging love of life which the English imagination and 488 tongue so desperately needed. Ovid, Virgil, Petrarch, Dante—the writers of the classic age were known and used by him in his various writings. But he was not merely a bookworm, he also enjoyed being an acute, penetrating observer of the human comedy which has continued throughout all ages, both before Chaucer and after him up to the present. So far as we can know, Chaucer wrote only because he enjoyed it. Like all writers, he could not help. Seeing the world, its illogical contrasts, and its rich variety. Seeing thus, and knowing, evidently he could no longer contain himself; his refreshing view of his own age, and of ourselves, if we can but see and be honest, is the result. That he enjoyed his writing seems proved by the obvious enjoyment of portraying human nature which ls the warming essence throughout his works. Tolerant, gentle, good humored, and delightfully whimsical, he is capable of satire and irony, but never does he lose his sanity and balance. As he chides and teases his characters for their all-too-human weaknesses, never does he become bitter; instead, his sympathy and understanding make us feel that of all great writers he most nearly becomes one of us, here on our "common-as-dirt" level. Most men he loves; in all events and persons he finds qualities which excite his eternal curiosity; only the hypocrite receives his censure. As summarized by one writer, "No one can tread Chaucer and not be glad to be in the world." Nor does Chaucer know but one segment of life. He is capable of humor always; he also has a genius RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 for wit, drama, and pathos. He includes the same enormous scope in his subject matter. In both prose and poetry he wrote on science, religion, philosophy, ethics, and rhetoric. In various earlier works he celebrates marriages of royalty, talks of the emptiness of fame, chides woman for her gossip and small talk, and reaches exalted grandeur and pathos in the portrayal of a great love. But all ingredients of Chaucer are ideally combined in his comprehensive masterpiece which he left unfinished at his death: The Canterbury Tales. In this collection of stories we have Chaucer at his richest and his best. His plan was to pretend himself a member of a group of thirty pilgrims traveling from London to Canterbury to visit the religious shrine of Thomas a Becket. After Chaucer described each person in the prologue, the host of the Tabard Inn was to act as something of a master of ceremonies, calling on each pilgrim to tell four tales, two on the way to Canterbury, and two during the return journey. Chaucer had written only his magnificent prologue and less than a quarter of the stories when he died. The prologue itself is a masterpiece of characterization, just as the stories excel in their narrative qualities. As he describes the knight, squire, doctor, lawyer, miller, plowman, and cook, among others, we realize that here is a cross-section of all humanity, intimately known and intensely portrayed until the characters become almost more real to us than they would be in actual life. Before we catch a brush stroke or two from this mural, a word about LESSON DEPARTMENT language. Chaucer wrote in Middle English, which is not familiar to our eyes nor ears, although it has many resemblances to modern English, so many, in fact, that with a minimum of effort, Chaucer can be read in the original (see pp. 104-105). As originally written, Chaucer's poetry is filled with a delicate music, and while we can get much of his beauty of content as he describes nature and humanity, the larger beauty of his lines is lost unless it can be heard. Realizing the severity of this loss, it must nevertheless be faced, since it seems better to lose part rather than all. With this in mind, note how much of the "knight" Chaucer gives us in a very few lines, here translated into modern English, but to be compared with the original in the text (lines 68-72): And even though he was valiant, he was wise, And in his manner as meek as a maiden. He had never uttered any vileness In all his life, to any kind of person. He was a truly perfect gentle knight. The Prioress, a nun (lines 127- 135): At meals well taught was she withal; She let no morsel from her lips fall 489 Nor wet her fingers deeply in her sauce. Well could she handle a morsel, and be careful That no drop ever fell upon her breast. Courtesy was her particular delight. Her upper lip wiped she so clean, That in her cup was no trace seen Of grease, when she had drunk her draught. The Merchant (lines 270-277): A Merchant was there with a forked beard, In motley array, and high on horse he sat, Upon his head a Flemish beaver hat His boots fastened tight and elegantly. His ideas he delivered most solemnly, Connected always with the increase of his profits. He wanted the sea safeguarded at any price Between Middleburg and Orwell. So we take but one brief glance; would there were time for more. Questions for Discussion 1. Beowulf contains both Christian and pagan elements. Isolate and identify examples of each. 2. Assign a sister to give additional material on the life and character of Bede. 3. Have the Parable of the Swallow read slowly and effectively and make comments on its literary value and modern application. 4. Give instances which illustrate the universality of Chaucer's characters in The Canterbury Tales. Sield Artllery Ora Pate Stewart Green swords Marching in rows, Clank in the wind, Glint in the sun.

Homer Durham HE social science lessons for 1949-50 are based on "The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General," section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The lessons follow, naturally, the previous year's study of "Latter-day Saint Political Thought." Whereas the lessons of last year were, of necessity, somewhat abstract, the new series has the advantage of relating to concrete scriptural verses in the Declaration of Belief. Each is explained, together with its significance for the problems of current political life. The seven preceding lessons attempted to portray some aspects of Latter-day Saint thinking with respect to the nature of government, constitutionalism, and public affairs, including international relations. The Declaration of Belief is a specific statement of an official position taken by the Church, in August 1835, with regard to law and government. It is one of the most unusual sections of the Doctrine and Covenants. The first lesson attempts to tell how and why. Each lesson will be accompanied by suggestions for class projects to the end that every member and class may arrive at a more complete understanding of what the various provisions of the Declaration signify. As the gospel is a way of life, and as modern life involves political processes at neatly every point, it is most important that all of us enlarge our understanding of the position of the Church in such matters. Students of the subject will be delighted to know, in advance, that the Declaration is a most liberal yet practical, simple but farreaching, platform. The same general references and helps listed for last year's study will again prove to be very beneficial and helpful. To come to a knowledge and appreciation of the position of the Church with regard to governments and laws is no mean nor simple task. The various statements issued by the leaders of the Church from Joseph Smith to the present day are most helpful in gaining this knowledge. Of course, the Doctrine and Covenants itself, with its useful cross-references and index, will be of constant assistance. Alert class leaders will also watch for illustrations and examples to be found in current Church and other literature. Society is most complex. Social science lessons dealing with important relationships of the Church in society require, and are worthy of sincere study and effort. The titles of the seven lessons for 1949-50 and their accompanying objectives follow: Lesson 1. "The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General" Objective: To study and appreciate the preamble of The Declaration of Belief. LESSON DEPARTMENT Lesson 2. The Significance of "The Declaration of Belief' for Modern Government Objective: To consider different types of government in the world today, and to appreciate the basic principles contained in the "Declaration of Belief" as the culmination of the experience of the race. Lesson 3. Government Instituted for the Benefit of Man Objective: To show that governments exist for the benefit of man when founded on the free exercise of conscience, right and control of property, and protection of life. Lesson 4. Public Administration and Good Government Objective: To point out the need for 491 electing government officials who will uphold freedom. Lesson 5. The Obligations of Citizenship and the Responsibility of the State Objective: To show the responsibility of the State to enact proper laws and of the people to uphold them. Lesson 6. The Conditions for Achieving the Kingdom of God Objective: To show that civil and religious liberty must be maintained for the establishment of the Kingdom of God. Lesson 7. Achieving 'the Kingdom of God Objective: To demonstrate that the Kingdom of God will be achieved by preaching the gospel throughout the world. Lesson 1—"The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General" (D. & C. Section 134) G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, October 25, 1949 Objective: To study and appreciate the preamble of the Declaration of Belief. Political Attitude of Church Toward Society GECTION 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is well known as "A Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General." The section carries the date, August 17, 1835, and was "adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly.... Held at Kirtland, Ohio." It may be said to have three great purposes: 1. It declares the attitude of the Church towards the rest of society, in so far as society functions as a politically organized community. In other words, the Declaration provides the basis for what might be called "the foreign policy" of the Church, that is, the relation of the Church to the various governmental systems of the world. 2. It provides the basis upon which individual members of the Church may adjust their lives to the demands of citizenship, satisfy the requirements of effective citizenship, and at the same time maintain religious freedom. 3. It sets forth certain great political principles as the standard of conduct for the members of the Church, for the Church as an organization, and as the 492 basis for understanding and evaluating the conduct of the governments of the world. As a result, the Declaration may be said to contain the principles which Latter-day Saints should strive to uphold and maintain so far as governments and laws "in general" are concerned. Practical Values of the Declaration The Declaration has great practical value to the Church, to the State, and to the individual. When is a government a good government? When is a governmental policy worthy of criticism? Which candidates for office should be supported? What should our attitude be towards the public officials, local, regional, national, and international, who serve us? When should they receive support? When, if ever, should we deny them support? Is 'disobedience to law or a_ public official ever justified? The Declaration affords a practical basis for determining the answers to these questions which arise daily in our lives. Shall we support the United Nations and its officers? Shall we support our local officials in a policy to provide a new sewer, bridge, highway, or dam? Shall we choose this man or that one to represent us in our national assemblies? Mankind stands in need of criteria, guiding principles, standards of judgment. Section 134 contains standards of judgment which are time-tested and which have received the support of the most enlightened men, women, and societies known to civilization. How little most of us RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 appreciate this section! How grateful we should be that our people and our Church have adopted such principles. If we needed to dig a garden, and we were provided with shovel, plow, and tractor, most of us would know how to do it with the tools provided. The modern world needs to "dig a garden," a garden of good politics and good government, to replace the wasted lands of war and corruption. The Declaration of Belief provides the tools for this task. The principles available are basic and fundamental to world peace and prosperity at home. Let us see, briefly, what they are. Some Principles of Successful Political Life Here are some of the great principles of successful political life assetted in the document of August 17, 1835: 1. Governments exist for the benefit of man. 2. As well as being responsible to the people, governments, through their officials, are responsible to God for their actions, and God holds men responsible whether or not they, in turn, are willing to accept their share of the contract. 3. The "good and safety" of society are the principles which should guide, alike, lawmakers and the administrators of the law.. Freedom of conscience for all men. 5. The right and control of individual property. 6. The protection of human life and its preservation. 7. Freedom of organization, including religious organizations. 8. Separation of Church and State as a principle essential to religious liberty, freedom of organization, and good society. G. Active citizenship to sustain and uphold all governments that protect "'inherent and inalienable rights." LESSON DEPARTMENT 10. Honor, respect, even deference, for public officials. 11. Sedition, rebellion, and ordinary crime should be properly punishable according to law, said law recognizing basic private rights. 12, The right of self-defense is justifiably used when civil government breaks down; but it is the task of all citizens to maintain sound civil government and to prevent the breakdown of orderly processes. 13. The right to proselyte and advance one's opinions or those of his group is essential and must be maintained. However, the right should not be insisted upon to the point that its use becomes obnoxious to others, oF to the extent that human life and liberty are jeopatdized. These are among the great principles to be studied in the social science lessons this year. The discovery and use by man of these principles have matked the progress of civilization. For example, when Solon, the great Athenian reformer, about 594 B. C., expanded the rights of private property in Athens, freedom of conscience, "the good and safety of society," the development of democratic government became possible. History of the Declaration What is the history of this remarkable document? How does a declaration regarding politics and government find its way into the official doctrines and covenants of the Latter-day Saints? Elder Joseph Fielding Smith has written on the subject as follows: At a conference of the Church held in Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835, the Doctrine and Covenants was presented to the assembled conference for their acceptance OT rejection. After the brethren there assembled had carefully and 493 studiously considered the matter, the revelations which had been previously selected by the Prophet Joseph Smith were accepted as the word of the Lord by the unanimous vote of the conference, and were ordered printed. On the occasion Joseph Smith the Prophet and his second counselor, Fredin Michigan, and because of this were not familiar with all the proceedings of this conference. After the conference had accepted the revelations, an article on marriage, which had been written by Oliver Cowdery, was read by Elder William W. Phelps, and was ordered printed in the book with the revelations. When this action had been taken, Oliver Cowdery arose and read another article, also written by himself, on ""Governments and Laws in General." This article the conference also ordered printed wn the book of Doctrine and Covenants. Unfortunately, a great many people because these articles appeared in the Doctrine and Covenants, readily concluded that they had come through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and hence were to be received on a par with the other parts of the book of revelations. Because 0 this misinformation articles have been time to time declaring that these words on Government and Laws have come to us with the force of revelation having been from the mouth "Marriage" [no being supplanted by a marriage] lations by the conference, but were published as an expression of belief of the (Progress of Man, pp: 367-368). See also. Documentary History of the Church, Il, pp. 243-251- The preamble to the Declaration, also adopted by the general assembly of August 17, 1835, makes this important statement: That our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not 494 be misinterpreted nor misunderstood, we have thought proper to present at the close of this volume our opinion concerning the same. The phrase, "this volume," refers of course to the Doctrine and Covenants. 'The words, "our opinion," should also be carefully observed in the light of the statement quoted from Elder Joseph Fielding Smith. In many respects, the Declaration has a unique value in that it is the "opinion" of the Latter-day Saints, accepted from the pen of Oliver Cowdery. Although Oliver Cowdery was the Second Elder of the Church and stood next to Joseph Smith, yet the Declaration is given for what it really is, a declaration of belief. It does not purport to be a revelation from God. As such it had unique value to the infant Church of 1835, whose enemies would be inclined to scoff at a "revelation," but might take seriously the declarations and resolutions taken in a conference of record. Moreover, it is of great interest to find, in a Church designed to offer the restored gospel to all peoples, popular expression side by side with revealed word. The 134th section demonstrates the reality of the law of common consent in the Church. We should never forget that the law of common consent has _ been revealed as a principle of Church government with the principle of divine authority.' In many respects, the book of Doctrine and Covenants would be incomplete without such a "covenant" and expression as section 134. But lest there be any doubt as to RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 its importance, President Heber J. Grant said in 1938, commenting on the principles outlined in section 134: These principles are fundamental to our belief, fundamental to our protection. And in the providences of the Lord, the safeguards which have been incorporated into the basic structure of this nation are the guarantee of all men who dwell here against the abuses and _ tyrannies and usurpations of times past (Gospel Standards, page 134). The principles embodied in the Declaration are based on abiding religious realities. 'They are expressive of an absolute standard of truth, without which, men resort to force. The study and application of these principles today will further prepare the way for the fulfillment of mankind's aspiration for peace on earth. Questions for Discussion and Lesson Helps Special Project: Assign a member of the class to prepare a ten-minute report on the material found in volume II, chapter XVIII (pp. 243-251) of the Documentary History of the Church. The Documentary History of the Church, published in seven volumes, is available in many homes, especially volumes I and II which have been used as Melchizedek Priesthood manuals (1947- 49). This material (pp. 243-251 of volume II) contains the historical background, with minutes and documents, of the general assembly of the Church, August 17, 1835, which adopted the "Declaration of Belief." 1.
