pressures, or by placing her child for adoption. Most children who are placed in institutions or who are being cared for by agencies in foster homes cannot be adopted. They have parents or relatives who are not willing to give them up. As a rule, courts do not feel they can end the nghts of parents who do not want to give yp their children. Unless these rights are ended, agencies cannot place such children for adoption. Agencies are reluctant to place a child who has parents or relatives who may be able to take care of him. Often children removed from their homes because of neglect still have strong ties with their parents or with their brothers and sisters. It may be best for them to hold onto these ties. Some children are like plants, they can't be moved from place to place. When you uproot them they are unable to fix themselves in a new soil. | The waiting lists for children in agencies are long. 'The number of persons who seek to adopt a child is far greater than the number of children who can be adopted. Even after an agency accepts a home as good for a child, it may be months or years before a child can be placed in it. Doctors, lawyers, friends, and relatives too often by-pass the agency in placement of children and, hence, many children who should go through an agency in placement never reach it. Heartache and uncertainty for the adoptive parents often result from the independent 666 placement where no knowledge of the child's background or his physical or mental capacity is available. Take, for example, the tragic story of one couple who chose the easy black market way to adoption. This couple were physically unable to have children of their own. 'They heard of a person from whom, for a fee, they could receive a child for adoption. 'The couple contacted the person, paid their money, and received a beautiful baby. For a time they were extremely happy, but several months later they discovered a serious heart condition which medical science could not cure. The child died, and the adoptive parents were far more lonely than they were before receiving the child. An experience such as this could have been avoided if this couple had worked through a licensed adoption agency. DOPTION is a legal process and is, therefore, controlled by laws and procedures that are intended to protect both the prospective parents and the child. The adoption laws of many states recognize the importance of delaying the final adoption for a long enough period to satisfy the court that the adjustment is a happy one. It is frequently impossible to judge the mental capacity of a young infant, and this period, before final adoption, affords an opportunity for the child to be studied and for the adoptive parents to have reasonable assurance of his normal development. The laws of a number of states require that the child remain in the adoptive home for six months or a year before the adoption is made final. Agencies of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE-—OCTOBER 1949 recognized standing, even in states that have no such legal provision, require such a trial period; and many of them advise that the final adoption be delayed until the child has been in the home for one or two years. Moreover, if the adoptive parents have the assistance and advice of such an agency during this period, the progress and development of the child can be studied; and if situations of an undesirable nature arise, the adoption plans can be terminated. _ The law in Utah, as in many other states, prohibits placement of children for adoption outside the State. Therefore agencies in Utah are unable to place children in homes for adoption outside of the State. Operating under the direction of the Relief Society General Board Association in Salt Lake City, is an agency licensed for the purpose of placement of children for adoption and foster-home care in the State of Utah only. The general policies and procedures for this agency are the same as those previously pointed out for all adoption agencies, with the exception of the eligibility requirements of religion. In order for a couple to be considered eligible to receive a child for adoption, they must be active Latter-day Saints, observing and adhering to the standards of the Church. Staffed by professional personnel trained to handle the problems of adoption, sound adoption principles are practiced and every attempt is made to meet the needs of the child, the real mother, and the adoptive parents. t uses, el ly whe Nght closed in he atly and blotted oy any possible 2 aah ce ne eens ee VISION Of the frail or barns; amet cranked the h dle of the father are SY on business, Phone briskly to call § th, but the Y MOrning the landscape, hat phone Was lifeless, like an inert bog Biz; be seen of It through th In her han She rusheq frantical] living sno > Was eerie and _ to the older woman, « can't get unending; the storm gave no Ptomise Smith's!
