Dad lendall' visit?" PT€cious d do n Garnet', throat tightened. "Yes, > amet limped to fe BUSS you could call it that." TEMPERED HE was a long time doing the chores that night. It was dark in the barn and she hung the lantern on a crossbeam so she could finish her work. She fed the chickens and gave the cows an extra portion as a farewell supper. It was a solemn rite as she measured the grain for old Chub and Buttercup. She had earned her right to live happily at Wheatlands, and she didn't want to leave. She knew that she could learn to be every bit as capable as Mickey if they'd just have a little patience with her. Down on her knees, with her arms around Wobbly-leg's neck, she whispered a silly little farewell to the calf. Her tears fell unchecked. The door opened suddenly with an angry screech of cold hinges and old Grant stood framed in the door, Lee behind him. Then the older man was pushed aside and Lee had her in his arms. "Are you hurt, honey? Are you all right?" Lee kept asking as his eyes devoured her. "Drat Smith, anyhow!" old Grant sputtered. "He had no business gettin' sick! This's no kind of work for you, daughter!" The word slipped out as easily as though he'd been saying it for years. He didn't even notice that he'd said it! "But... But I thought you 671 9 wouldn't be home." Garnet tried to say. Lee explained, "We came back a day earlier because of the storm. Had a bad time getting here, too." "We stopped by the house," old Grant said, patting her shoulder awkwardly, "saw Mother and Smith, too." 'There was something like tenderness in his eyes as he said, "They both told us how hard you'd worked. Now get in the house and get your wet things off or you'll have pneumony!" His tones were gruff, but his eyes held admiration. And Lee's eyes were saying things, too! Sweet, lover-like things, then a frown overshadowed them. "Why were you going away? Smith said that you were going on a visit." Garnet hid her eyes against his shoulder and could not answer immediately. | Old Grant spoke first. "Why, sure, boy, take her down home for a little visit—all brides like to go home! But don't stay too long, girl, we need you here where you belong!" For old Grant, that was a lengthy speech. Garnet leaned heavily in Lee's arms. Now, they'd never have to know just how long she had planned to stay! And in just a little while, as soon as she was positive, She had something better to tell them. Her eyes were shining through her tears as she kissed her fatherin-law. _.. Yast Naturally Tris W.

Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, October 1, and October 15, 1889 "For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WomMeEN OF ALL NATIONS" THE DOZEN GREATEST POETS: Perhaps I may be permitted to recapitulate the list of a dozen English poets whom I ventured to quote as the manifest immortals of our British Parnassus. 'They are Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Keats, Shelley. It will be noticed that there are thirteen names here, and my reviewers have not failed to remind me that it is notoriously difficult to count the stars. The fact is that Gray, the real thirteenth, was an afterthought, and I will admit that, although Gray is the author of what is perhaps the most imposing single short poem in the language, and although he has charm, skill and distinction to a marvelous degree, his originality, his force of production, were so rigidly limited that he may scarcely be admitted to the first rank.— Exchange SEPTEMBER At eve cool shadows fall Across the garden wall, And on the clustered grapes in purple turning, And pearly vapors lie Along the eastern sky Where the broad harvest moon is redly burning. Ah! Soon on field and hill The winds shall whistle chill, And patriarch swallows call their flocks together, To fly from frost and snow, To seek for lands where blow The fairer blossoms of a balmier weather. —Selected A HAPPY OCCASION: At the residence of Mrs. Libbie R. Pratt in the 17th Ward, in this city there was a joyful meeting of Sisters in the faith and fellowship, to celebrate the birthday anniversary of the venerable mother in Israel, Mrs. Sarah D. Rich, widow of the late Apostle Charles C. Rich, who on that day reached the age of 75 years. Her daughter Sarah Jane Miller was present and also Ben Rich from Ogden, and Mrs. Pratt at whose residence the party met is also a daughter of the respected lady in whose honor they had convened together. Sister Rich has been a member of the Church 54 years and is the last one of her father's family remaining. She was recommended four times by different persons to be the wife of Apostle Rich before they saw each other, and became engaged to him by correspondence. RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE, St. George, Utah: Mrs. Anna Woodbury, counselor to Pres. Ivins, St. George Stake, spoke of the scattered condition of the Relief Society and the long distances the sisters must travel to visit branch organizations and the difficulties to be encountered in going to the farthest places. Yet they made a practice of visiting all around once a year. She felt to shed tears of joy when young men would rise up and bear testimony of the truth of the Latter-day work; felt much interested in the young people, spoke of the silk culture and what had been accomplished by the sisters there.

May often be noted that two children who have grown to maturity side by side, whose parents have earned comparable incomes, and who, to all appearances, have had equal opportunities, still may differ widely in the richness and variety of their backgrounds. These two children moreover may sit for years in the same classrooms exposed to the same training and yet, in some subjects, one may Te veal a broader understanding and keener perception of the implications of the written word than the other. A careful appraisal of the two homes would probably indicate the reason. While the one home might contain a bookcase full of beautifully bound sets of books, the only reading material to be found throughout the rest of the house might consist of current magazines and the latest books of only passing interest. 'The second home, on the other hand, might not possess beautifully bound books, but one would fnd bookcases in neatly every room in the house containing books suited to the age of the different family members, from picture books for the youngest child to great masterpieces for the older members of the family. A. Friend once asked another, Page 6/4 Martin Farquhar Tupper "How is it that your children know all about the Roman and Greek gods and goddesses and heroes? Mine are having a struggle to learn about them in school." "Why," the mother explained, "I used to read them myths when they were small and as they grew older I bought them Bullfinch's Age of Fables and the Iliad and the Odyssey. They love those stories." "Oh," her friend replied rather blankly, "I see. To tell you the truth, I have never read those books m
