LESSON g¢= ie} DEPARTMENT Sheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 18—"Our Lord's Ministry In Perea and Judea" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 26, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, November 1, 1949 Objective: To demonstrate that Jesus taught a plan of life capable of saving all who will repent and obey him. His Rejection in Samaria HERE is a wide variance among the synoptic writers as to the sequence of events in the life of Christ during the last few months of his earthly life. It seems clear that, after the events discussed in lesson 17, he went into Perea and possibly into a small part of Samaria. This time, however, racial prejudice overcame their hospitality, and the Samaritans rejected Jesus because he was going toward Jerusalem and was a Jew. On his previous visit he had been gladly received and entreated to remain. James and John, the Sons of Thunder, resented the disrespect shown their Master and wanted the Lord to command that fire should come from heaven and consume his enemies, "even as Elias did." (Read II Kings 1:10-12.) Jesus rebuked them saying: "... Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them..." Page 550 (Luke 9:55-56). Let us remember that thought. The purpose of Jesus is to save. Leaving the Samaritan village with no bitterness, the group went to another, as the Lord had instructed the twelve to do. This was one of his great lessons on tolerance, charity, patience, and longsuffering. He had the power to avenge a wrong, but, instead of using it, he chose to forgive. It may be parenthetically observed that most of the soul-touching incidents of this and other journeys were recorded only by Luke. He was a physician and has been called the humanitarian of the synoptic writers. Every miracle of healing recorded by the other synoptic writers in the New Testament is also recorded by Luke and, in addition, he records many not mentioned by the others. Luke gives the incident of the three men who wanted to become disciples of Christ on conditions. One hesitated to enter the ministry because of the 552 hardships entailed; one wanted first to bury his father; and the other wanted to bid his loved ones farewell. Jesus taught each of them a great lesson. Service in the kingdom of God supersedes other duties. The Seventy Charged and Sent About this time Jesus called the seventy to assist the twelve in the ministry. He sent them: "two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come." (Read carefully Luke 10:1-12.) With the calling and sending forth of the seventy, the work of the ministry was greatly expanded. They were not restrained, as the twelve had been at first, from going to the towns in Samaria or even to the Gentiles. Jesus himself began going into Gentile territory. His plan provided for taking the gospel to all the world. He must make that plain before he finished his mortal career. He gave. Us proof by sending his authorized ministers to non-Jewish people. The Lord's work is progressive. At first it was confined to Israel but, during his lifetime and immediately following his resurrection, he inaugurated a plan to have the gospel preached to all the world. "For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call" (Acts 2:39). The Seventy Return When the seventy returned and reported their labors, Jesus rejoiced at their faithfulness. 'They had exercised in righteousness the powers RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 he had given them. He told them to rejoice because they were accepted of the Lord rather than because they had power over evil spirits. Jesus always turned to his Father, whether in joy or in sorrow. Who Is My Neighbor? Probably soon after the return of the seventy, an incident occurred which drew from the Savior one of his most valuable and appreciated parables. Luke tells us that a "certain lawyer' asked a question to tempt Jesus. It was probably done to embarrass the Lord. He put this question: "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" The great teacher replied with a counter question—often the most effective way. "What is written into the law? How readest thou?" The man readily showed that he was familiar with the law and replied: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself." 'The answer was correct and Jesus said: "This do, and thou shalt live." 'Then the lawyer made further inquiry: "And who is my neighbour?" (Luke 10:25-29). The Savior then gave him and all of us the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37). It should be carefully read. It is not only a great story but is rich in precious lessons. (The story can be made more graphic by use of a map showing the location of Jericho and Jerusalem and the account of how the road between them was infested with robbers.) Many priests and Levites lived at Jericho. Picture the victim of the robbers as being a Jew; LESSON DEPARTMENT it is almost certain that he was. A great lesson can be taught by this parable showing how prone we are to find excuses for not doing the right thing as did the priest and Levite. However, the "essential difference between the Samaritan and the others was that the one had a compassionate heart, while they were unloving and selfish." Jesus taught the world one of his greatest lessons—that those who are kind, charitable, and righteous consider all men as neighbors. Martha and Mary An incident occurred during one of the Lord's visits to Bethany which has occasioned much discussion. He went to the home of two sisters, Mary and Martha. Jesus loved these two sisters and also their brother, Lazarus. Martha was concerned with the physical welfare of their guest while Mary sat at his feet listening reverently to his teachings. Martha soon complained and said: Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her (Luke 10:40-42). The lesson is not that the practical things of life are not essential, because they are essential, but that in every home time also should be found for cultivating that better part—true spiritual development which comes through study and worship of God. 553 Ask and It Shall Be Given You Criticism of Pharisees and Lawyers Jesus took occasion to teach more about prayer. We have heretofore, in connection with the Sermon on the Mount, discussed prayer and particularly the Lord's Prayer. We will not repeat this discussion but recommend the reading of Luke 11:1-13. In fact, we may study with profit all of Luke, chapter 11. The Lord gave a scathing rebuke to the Pharisees and lawyers but space will not permit here a detailed study of this denunciation. The Disciples Admonished and Encouraged Let us turn rather to a study of his encouragement and advice given to his disciples. He warned especially against hypocrisy. Jesus refused to take sides in petty quarrels and especially in matters involving legal administration. Any other course would have involved him in useless discussion and might have given color to the charge that he was arrogating to himself functions of legal tribunals. (Repeat the 12th article of faith.) During the progress of his Perean ministry, Jesus reiterated some of the wonderful truths he had given in the Sermon on the Mount. He repeated for 'the sake of emphasis. He told his disciples that if they would truly seek the kingdom of God all needful things would be added. They were taught in the Parable of the Foolish Rich Man to lay up their treasures in heaven; that the wealth of earth would all be left at death. Their leaders should especially be faithful. More had been given to them and more 554 would be required. He referred feelingly to his foreknown death and told them of the strife and trouble which would follow. "Except Ye Repent Ye Shall All Likewise Perish" Some of the people who had been listening to the Lord's discourse reported the circumstances of a tragic event that had occurred in the immediate area, in which many had been killed—some at the base of the altar inside the temple walls. Some were inclined to the view that the deaths of these Galileans were merited retributions. Jesus assured them that those who had suffered were not greater sinners than other Galileans but added: "... But, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish" (Luke 13:3). God, not man, is to judge. The absolute need for repentance was illustrated by the Parable of the Barren Fig Tree. (Read Luke 13:6-9.) A Woman Healed on the Sabbath Jesus once more healed a sick woman on the Sabbath day and was criticized by the ruler of the synagogue. 'Ihe woman had been sick for eighteen years. Luke, the beloved physician, tells us the Lord said she had been bound or "had a spirit of infirmity" for all those years. Jesus again silenced his adversaries, and his believers were made happy. Will Many or Few Be Saved? On his journey toward Jerusalem, Jesus taught in many of the cities and towns of Perea. One person RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 who had been impressed by his doctrine asked: "Lord, are there few that be saved?" Jesus replied: "Strive to enter in at -the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able" (Luke 13:23-30). It is clear from latter-day revelation that the Lord will divide his children in the hereafter according to their works into at least three kingdoms—celestial, terrestrial, and telestial. (Read D. & C., section 76.) Jesus Warned of Herod's Design As Jesus approached Jerusalem, he was warned of Herod's designs, but he steadfastly continued his course. Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. What great lesson did Jesus teach to his disciples who wanted to wreak vengeance on the Samaritans' village which rejected the Lord? 2. Give an account of the calling of the seventy. Discuss their duties and tell what powers were given to them. 3. Relate the Parable of the Good Samaritan. What lessons does it teach? 4. What did the Savior mean where he said to Martha, ""But one thing is needful?" 5. What are the characteristics of true prayer? References in the Gospels Matt. 10:5-42; 15:24; 18:21,22; 23; 28:19. Luke 3:9; 9:51-62; 10:1-19, 25-42; 1121-54; 12:1-12, 14-31, 35-573 13:1-9, 11-35; 18:1-5. John 4:4-42; 10:22, 40; 11:5; 11:54. LESSON DEPARTMENT 555 Visiting Seacher Nlessages—Our Savior Speaks Lesson 2—"Behold, | Stand at the Door and Knock" (Rev. 3:20) Mary Grant Judd For Tuesday, November 1, 1949 Objective: To point out that Christ is ever ready to enter our hearts, if we but prepare the way. ANY of the utterances of our Savior ate figurative in their nature. So with this one. If we consider the quotation in its entirety, we Shall see that the complete statement, in order to be made more forceful, is clothed in metaphorical language. To quote the expression in full: Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me (Rev. 3:20). If Christ is not speaking of an actual door that we may open, if he does not mean that we may truly sup with him and he with us, then just what does he imply? He is pleading with us to hear his voice and accept his message. The door we are asked to open is that of our minds, our hearts, our souls. The bread he desires us to partake of is the bread of life. And if we open the door to him and bid him enter, the result will be pleasant even as it is when friends break bread together. Unfortunately, the call of the gospel falls, at times, upon deaf ears. We are too busy with the ordinary affairs of life to heed it. We are like those of whom the Lord spoke in the Parable of the Marriage Supper when he said: Schonherr "LO! I STAND AT THE DOOR AND KNOCK" A Perry Picture A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. 556 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things (Luke 14:16-21), * Are we not sometimes like the guests who were bade to the supper yet who, by making excuses, deptived themselves of the enjoyments that might otherwise have been theirs? Someone has said, "We are not punished for our sins but by them." And our modern scripture declares: There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated (D. & C. 130:20-21), RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 We feel at home with those who are like ourselves. A friend is one with whom we have much in common. Accordingly, if the Man of Galilee is to be a welcome guest, we must become like him. Remembering his purity of life, let us try to conform our lives to the one perfect example. Then we shall be attuned to the gospel message which he bears, and we shall open — the doors of our hearts to him for he has said: He that receiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me (D. & C. 39:5). | WVork MM leeting—Sewi ng Children's Clothing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 2—Layettes and Baby Sewing Jean Ridges Jennings For Tuesday, November 8, 1949 HE modern mother, when planning the layette for her baby, puts greatest emphasis on baby's comfort, protection, freedom for activity, and allowance for growth. Being a practical person, she selects a minimum layette at a minimum cost, as she realizes that baby will very soon outgrow these garments. Infants become irritable and fidgety when their clothing is not comfortable. If mothers would carefully analyze their conduct they would usually find that the reason for crying and fretting can be traced to clothing. Hence, baby's clothes should have the following characteristics: 1. Allowance for exercise and growth. 2. No bulky fullness to lie on. (A little extra fullness can become very uncomfortable after long periods of lying in the same place.) 3- Flat, smoothly finished, loose fitting necklines. (Lace, embroidery, and bulky collars irritate a baby's chin and neck. Collars roll up around the face and the corners are pushed into the baby's mouth.) 4. Convenient closing that simplifies dressing and prevents unnecessary handling of the baby. (For everyday wear, garments with full-length front openings that lap generously to prevent ugly gaps are practical. Otherwise, wide openings: should be allowed so that the garments can easily be slipped on.) LESSON DEPARTMENT 5. Fastenings easy to manage and not troublesome to launder. (Be sure fastenings are placed so they do not cause discomfort to baby when lying down. ) 6. As few seam lines as are essential to good fit. (Simple workmanship js always preferable. Seams should be narrow and smoothly finished. ) 7- Hand finishing for softness and flexibility of workmanship, 8. Easy and quick to launder neatly. (Materials must be durable enough to Stand up under frequent launderings, ) 9. Economical and simple to make at home. 10. Materials of very dresses; bird's-eye, knit tubing, and outing flannel for gowns. ) Tie fastenings of very narrow cotton, twistless tape are generally preferable to tiny buttons The tapes wear well, are Casy to manage, and Cause no trouble in washing and Ironing, For daytime wear, dresses should be no longer than toe length and wide enough at the lower edge to permit baby to kick and exercise his leg muscles. Bias, rather 357 than straight-cut slips, have certain advantages, They spread in whichever direction there is need of room and require no set-in fullness. Sleeves should be loose enough at the bottom and at the armhole to allow freedom of movement. White materials stand the necessarily repeated launderings of the baby's clothes much better than colored materials, Dainty pastel colors are attractive, but before using them make certain that materials are color-fast. The most satisfactory seam to use in making these tiny garments is a very narrow French seam. Around armholes where there is a set-in sleeve, use the false French seam. That is a plain seam with edges turned together and finely slipstitched together by hand. It looks like a French seam when finished. Dainty handwork and decorative stitching make lovely trimming and are easier to launder and less bulky for baby than too much applied ruffling and lace. <i 9 Dry-Farm Blues Wanda Green Nielson A lake would be a lovely thing to see, ancing in the sunlight, asleep beneath the moon; A creek would be a happy thing to hear, Singing, as it spilled along, a carefree little tune.

Jacobs Lesson 2—Legends of Chivalry For Tuesday, November 15, 1949 FTER their conquest of England in 1066, the French stayed. The Normans ruled; the Anglo-Saxons were enslaved under the feudal system. French was spoken by the polite and the wealthy who were, of course, the ruling class. Latin was the universal language of scholarship employed by the clergy and by all secular writers who dreamed of permanence for their works. AngloSaxon, which gradually evolved until it became what we now call Middle English, was spoken by the common, conquered people. 'This language was a badge of crudeness, a necessary evil to be ignored, or, when acknowledgment was forced, to be acknowledged only with contempt. The passing centuries mellowed this relationship fundamentally. Gradually, as these Frenchmen became Anglo-Normans, then Englishmen, both the language and the content of their culture were absorbed by the masses of English people. Finally, the versatile and powerful English language and literature were born from the wedding of ancient Celtic and Teutonic legends to French culture and literary romance. At the Battle of Hastings in 1066 a victorious Norman poet sang a song commemorating the death of Roland, the great French hero and nephew of Charlemagne, Emperor of France. From such origins grew the chanson de geste or "song of great deeds," of which The Song of Roland became the outstanding example. 'These metrical songs praising the virtues of loyalty, courage, and physical strength in battle, provided a rhyme-scheme and a tradition from which the chivalric romances evolved, particularly in Southern France. When, in 1152, Eleanor of Aquitaine, a strong admirer of French literature and song, became the wife of Henry II of England, she brought the latest fashions in French literature directly to the English court. Similarly, Eleanor of Savoy again reinforced the popularity of the chivalric romances when she left France to marry Hen- - ry III in 1236. Thus the ideals of chivalry, as praised in poetic lines of exquisite beauty, at once achieved even greater popularity with the most select court society. The word romance was first used to designate Old French, a language derived from Latin, or "Roman." Soon it came to designate a tale in French dealing with the marvelous adventures of a great hero who excelled in ideals of chivalry, a word derived from cheval, French for "horse." For many centuries the code of chivalry was almost a religion among the aristocratic classes. As page, squire, and, finally, as a knight, the noble youth was taught to love and obey its high principles. Truly, Chaucer's knight received the highest praise of the chivalric LESSON DEPARTMENT age when he was described as a "Parfit, gentle" knight, its source largely in Roland, with his relationship vere and Launcelot. The first found and the Purity of Launcelot, nd the itself one of the romance to be found in any literature, 4 similarity of Material, the four been attributed to a From evidence within the poems, Particularly the longest and bestit Gawain and the Green we can conjecture that the author was at home Court circles and in the open fields. 560 and delicacy of statement. For the modern reader its plot is reasoned and well-balanced, its description is vivid and colorful, and the dialogue shows both subtlety and finesse. If the rhyme-scheme, the gay language, and some of the plot betray a French influence, the name of the hero and the incidents of the beheading game are drawn directly from Celtic lore. Here, true to his Celtic origins, Gawain is not a weak-willed quarrelsome playboy as he has been painted by Tennyson and others; rather he combines the bravery of the French Launcelot with the purity of Galahad to approach being the ideal knight. Yet never is he "goody-goody" nor artificial. He has about him the flavor of a normal man. His courage and loyalty in the face of fear, his essential honesty and restraint mark him as a man excellent among his kind. But when the huge axe swung out at his neck, he winced, and when Morgan le Fay tempted Sir Gawain to make love to her while her husband was hunting, he was genuinely tempted. Synopsis: On New Year's Day a giant knight, dressed in rich green, boldly rides his charger into King Arthur's banquet hall, challenging any knight to defend the honor of the Round Table by giving the Green Knight one blow with the axe, then taking one from him in return, a year later, at the Green Chapel in North Wales. When all become silent in fear, King Arthur finally rises to defend the honor of all. Sir RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 Gawain then accepts the charge, and with one blow of the massive axe whose head is about four feet across, he cuts off the Green Knight's head. To their astonishment, the group sees the knight pick up his own head and ride off, calling back to Gawain not to forset his appointment. Next Chnstmas Day Gawain finds a castle in a lonely forest and asks directions to the Green Chapel. The lord of the castle says it is nearby and asks Gawain to be his guest until the appointed day, the two men to exchange what they earn from each day's hunt. Then while the master is hunting, the lady of the castle goes to Gawain's bedchamber and tempts him to become her lover. Through artful dodging and argument he evades her advances, accepting only her formal kisses which, he in turn, gives to the lord as he returns from each day's hunt. On the third day, the lady gives him a green girdle which will preserve him from harm; this Gawain keeps and wears on New Year's Day when he meets the fierce Green Knight at the chapel. The Knight swings the axe twice but each time a little short of Gawain's neck. The third time he barely nicks Gawain and then reveals himself as the lord of the castle. He tells his name, Bernlak de Hautdesert, and that of his wife, Morgan le Fay, and how the two had plotted to dishonor both Sir Gawain and King Arthur. Since Sir Gawain had resisted all temptation except the green girdle, his life is spared. He then philosophizes to the Green Knight how from Adam to Samson to David man has been LESSON DEPARTMENT made foolish through the wiles of woman: "If a knight could love them well and believe them not, it were a great gain." Returning to Camelot, he tells his story before the knights of the Round Table, blushing in shame as he shows the wound on his neck. And I must needs wear this as long as I live. For none can hide his fault, but some mishap will reveal it; for if it once has clung to thee, it will never be severed from thee. The poem ends with the excellent motto, "Evil to him who evil thinks." Note to Teachers The introduction to Chapter 2, pp. 74- 105 will enrich your background for this literary period, pp. 77-84, 94-96, 100-103 apply most directly to our lesson. This poem is brimming over with good food and fellowship (pp. 168, 177, 188), the loveliness of nature (p. 172 contrasted with her dismal moods pp. 174-5, 189-90), the excitement of the chase (pp. 179, 183, 184, 186, 188), skillful, intense dialogue (180, 183, 187) and excellent realistic, descriptive phrases throughout. For example, "Ladies laughed aloud, even when they were overlooked" (168:4), the description of birds sitting unhappily upon bare twigs, "piping piteously for pain of the cold" (175:56), the Green Knight's description (168-269), the returning hunters blowing their bugles, "the noisiest uproar that was lifted up in jest for Reynard's soul" (188:46), "mist hovered over the moorlands... Every hill wore a hat and a huge cloak of haze" (190:26), "'the clouds seemed... Grazed by the cliffs' (191:27). The vivid moods, the realistic, poetic language, and the skillful uses of contrast make delightful reading. Morte Darthur (The Death of Arthur) 1469 The hundred years following the Pearl Poet and Chaucer were bar- 561 ren of any significant literary production. The silence was broken by Sir Thomas Malory, the "last outpost" and most successful admirer of medieval chivalry In the period of unrest preceding the bloody War of Roses (1455-85) Sir Thomas Malory was convicted of multiple crimes. Apparently he spent the last twenty years of his life in prison for these purported crimes and for sedition. How guilty he was we cannot know; perhaps his definition of himself as "the servant of Jesu, both day and night" might not be so ironical and hypocritical as was once supposed. Morte Darthur was composed during his long years in prison. The ideals of morality and bravery and chivalry which he so loved were being buried beneath the cruel distress of the civil war which raged about him as he wrote. The flower of knighthood had passed, and surely, in writing of yesterday's golden age, Malory hoped to point a better way of life to his own tormented world. In 1485 Morte Darthur was printed by William Caxton, printer of the first book in English. His two great services to literature were his stabilization of the language and his printing of seventy-two works in English, among them Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Criseyde. A businessman who loved reading and literature, he edited Malory and others, somewhat to their detriment. His sense of style and grammar was not good; hence his own prefaces were predominantly practical, though sometimes they betrayed humor and good nature. Regardless of his er- 562 rors, his role in the development of English literature was invaluable. Since he had printed myths and legends of the Greeks and Romans, some of his critical countrymen asked why he hadn't printed. Something to honor English traditions. Persuaded of its value, he printed Malory's Morte Darthur, thereby initiating the widespread popularity of the Arthurian cycle of romances which,, has continued unbroken down,, to Our own time. We cannot be certain: that Ar thur (derived from the: Roman Artorius) ever lived. If he was real, he led the Celts against the Teutons early in the sixth century a. The historian Gildas, who wrote in the sixth century, doesn't mention him, and Nennius barely mentions him in his tenth-century history. It is Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Britons, written in the twelfth century, which. Must be acknowledged as being largely the creator of the Arthurian — legend. How much of Arthur was imagined and how much was based on traditions known to Geoffrey we cannot say. Regardless, in this text Arthur conquers all of Great Brittain and Ireland, Iceland, Scandinavia, and France, and finally subdues the Romans. By Malory's time the legend had grown tremendously. Save for one English poem, the fourteenth - century alliterative Morte Arthure, Malory's source was a French prose version, probably gathered into one manuscript. His task was to sift through almost ten times as much writing as he finally used, and from this chaotic mass of material to organize and select the main thread of a story both RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST. 1949 unified and interesting. If he left out some important incidents 'and clouded. Over such. Fundamental concepts as_ the convention — of courtly love, we must remember that Malory's Morte Darthur is the only Middle' English romance which treats the on of the Holy Grail. If the unity of content and. Of plot is weak and loose, we must remember that Morte Darthur is a ereat book, possessing the higher unity of style, tone, and mood. He transports us to a never-never land where there are no everyday monotonies, where the ladies enchant the gallant knights with their matchless beauty, and where we accept the miraculous as commonplace and the fantastic as true. Good as the story is, virile as the legend might be, it is Malory's ' simple, pe style that makes the story live. As delicately, cadenced prose is so ef ctive because it echoes with such exactness the tone and charm of the content. The narrative is told by and to the imagination, almost with a childlike sincerity and acceptance of the realm of fairies as delightful and true. Himself a man of action, his sentences are tight and bone-clean, yet the cadence and melody of his words are never broken. He crteates dramatic suspense, and his dialogues are easy and natural, yet ladem with overtones of meaning and emotion. Finally, we must remember that Malory was an idealist, just as the Middle Ages were idealistic despite their cruelty, intolerance, and bigotry.

All take their part in the work of modern government. "Governments" Within the United States The United States Bureau of the Census in 1942 attempted to count the number of "governments" operating within the single American system. 'The table is as follows: U. S. Government States ooo. Eeceeeceeeeeecceeeeece 48 Commies: eeee- 3,050 Townships or Towns 18,919 Municipalities - - ---.-- 16,220 School Districts -.---- 108,579 Special Districts -..- 8,299 Total 155,116 American government, with its written constitutions, both Federal and state, the Bill of Rights, the principle of limited government, pressure groups, elected representatives, and independent judiciaries— all these institutions affecting the functions listed in the foregoing paragraph through the 155,116 units totaled in the table—indicate that government is a very complex business, indeed. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 Types of Government in the International Field In the field of international relations, we perceive the outline of three or four significant international groups. 'They are: (1) the British Empire system, (2) the Soviet system, (3) the American system— which is linked with the British Empire system, and (4) the overall, loose, confederation of national States called the United Nations. These four prominent, overlapping, international organizations represent the chief political groups found today. Among the sixty-odd national States, these main groups and the great powers within them determine the course of war or peace, depression or prosperity. The British Empire is perhaps the oldest existing "international organization." It represents the skill, ingenuity, daring, and genius of the British people. Its territories are not integrated. They are far-flung in the seven seas and throughout the globe. Yet, the dominions of the British Empire represent a significant grouping of mankind into a political organization generally known as the "Bntish Commonwealth of Nations" which is a significant factor in world stability. The Soviet system embraces not only the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, but also the various areas under Soviet influence, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Roumania, Bulgaria, Outer Mongolia, and other States. Whereas, toleration, good will, liberty for political differences are nurtured and cherished in the British Empire system, even to the extent of granting independent status LESSON DEPARTMENT to India and Pakistan (the richest portions of the Empire), the Soviet system is dominated by the desire for world revolution and the world dictatorship of the Communist party. Its objectives are well-known. This system may be said to date roughly from 1917 and the Russian revolution. The American system consists not only of the United States and its island and Alaskan possessions, but also may be said to include the western hemisphere system of twenty-one American — republics. This western hemisphere system is, next to the British empire, the oldest international organization now in existence, having political significance. Modern International Affiliations Since World War II, the American and British systems have been linked together by means of wartime alliances, lend-lease, joint military staffs, the British loan of 1945, and more recently and more significantly, the Marshall plan and the Economic Co-operation Act, passed by the United States Congress in 1948. This bill, called the Foreign Assistance Act of 1948, has resulted in the creation of a sixteennation committee in Western Europe, which has, for its object, co-operation with the United States. This committee is called ""The Committee for European Economic Cooperation." It is a very unique international organization, inasmuch as it has been called into being by an act of the American Congress. Nevertheless, the organization _itself is a voluntary association of the 565 sixteen States composing it. Within this sixteen-power association for economic co-operation, there has emerged what is called "Western Union." Western Union is a military alliance between Great Britain, France, Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg. When the French, British, Dutch, and Belgian colonies are taken into consideration, for example, the rich Belgian Congo in Africa with its uranium deposits (the source of atomic energy), we see the strategic significance of Western Union. When it is realized that Western Union is_ linked through its British member to the United States by means of the "joint chiefs-of-staff," a military arrangement, not to mention the fact that the other four members of Western Union are part of the Marshall plan, we see how the British and American systems have linked themselves into a form of international organization. All the principal States of the world, except the defeated powers, are members of the United Nations. The charter of the United Nations is an effort to create a general international organization for the maintenance of peace. The hopes that attend its functioning as well as its strengths and weaknesses, are matters of daily concern to all the peoples of the world. International Organizations In addition to the mesh of local governments such as those found in the United States, and the great political groupings of international importance, there are many other small specialized _—_— organizations which help carry on the work of 566 modern government. The United States, alone, for example, belongs to 102 international organizations in which we participate actively. This number was listed in the United States government manual for 1947. For example, we belong to four international organizations in the field of agriculture, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. We belong to eight commercial and financial organizations, such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We belong to ten international organizations in the field of commodities, such as the International Wheat and Sugar Councils; then we belong to dozens of educational, scientific, cultural, political, legal, social, health, transport, communications organizations such as the Universal Postal Union, the International Labor Organization, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Pan-American Union, and so forth. All of these governments, the peoples they serve, and these various international organizations, have for their purpose, at some point or other, the maintenance of peace or some phase of human welfare and benefit. How can they be used to bring about a safe, sane world? Significance and Value of the Declaration of Belief It is amazing that a group of Latter-day Saint frontiersmen meeting in Ohio in 1835 would adopt a Declaration of Belief regarding government and laws in general which would contain basic principles capable of motivating human behavior now, as then, through a rather comRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 plex maze of political organization. As one of the foundation aspects of Latter-day Saint political thought, the Declaration of Belief should be more thoroughly studied and appreciated. It has great significance for the national modern State system. If the current wars that plague the world are to lead to eventual peace, men must have ideals to guide them. The Declaration of Belief constitutes a "spelling out" of practical ways and means to uttlize human government in such a way that they may reconcile their activities with the great ideal of a kingdom of God upon earth. It is a problem of the peoples involved, and particularly ourselves, to understand the principles and to utilize them, through these various governments and organizations which have been listed. Wherever the: Church of Jesus Christ itself and its Priesthood exist, the management and direction of the Church, its functioning in its wards, stakes, and missions, its program and its missionary work throughout the world, all must understand the Declaration and uphold its principles wherever human liberty makes such action possible. No one need fear to advocate these principles. They are sound. They represent the culmination of the experience of the race. The highest ideals of Greek, Roman, and English political experience may be said to be crystalized in the Declaration of Belief. It is for us to know and understand and appreciate these principles as a people and as citizens. In upholding them, we will find common ground with our neighbors, whatever creed or religion, so long as LESSON DEPARTMENT they recognize freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, and the great principles expounded in the Declaration. Responsibility of the Individual Where the individual himself is concerned, each one for himself must recognize that he has persuasive powers. We must all feel free to use these persuasive powers after understanding these principles, as each of us is potentially either an. Advocate of slavery or liberty. And govemments and laws have everything to do, nowadays, with the peace, happiness,- and even the temporal salvationof mankind.

Lund N lesson 7 we learned that President Snow had died suddenly in October 1901, just four days following the close of the October conference of the Church. Last month's lesson related that Joseph F. Smith was Called to fill the vacancy caused by the death of President Snow. In this lesson we shall learn of the men who ably assisted President Smith in his long administration and presided with him over the Church from 1901 to 1918. Seven days following the passing of President Snow, the First Presidency was reorganized. President Smith selected as his first counselor John Rex Winder who had _ been serving, since 1887, as second counJohn Henry Smith Charles, W. Penrose selor in the Presiding Bishopric. For his second counselor he chose Anthon H. Lund, a man of great vigor and conviction who had been a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles since 1889. 'This was a most fortunate selection of coworkers as each brought to the office of the First Presidency capacities and characteristics that were to be of great service to the Church. A special conference of the Church was called to convene in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on November 10, 1901, for the purpose of presenting the new Presidency to the membership of the Church for a sustaining vote. 'This was done by each quorum of the Priesthood voting separ- LESSON DEPARTMENT ately and then by a vote of the entire assemblage. The vote gave unanimous approval to the three above-mentioned men who were to constitute the First Presidency. Men are largely the product of their previous experiences and surroundings. In order to understand these men who were to serve President Smith, it is necessary for us to become acquainted with their backgrounds and previous history. John Rex Winder John Rex Winder, the first counselor, was nearly eighty years of age when called into the First Presidency. 'Today most people would think that a man of his age should have retired from active service many years before, but men are not so retired in the kingdom of God. President Winder was a man of great physical vitality and sound judgment. Born at Biddenden, England, on December 11, 1821, his early life was spent in preparation for clerical service, a vocation which he pursued until he came in contact with the restored gospel. Brother Winder was working in a retail store at Liverpool, England, in July 1848 when he first heard of the gospel. One day he picked up a scrap of paper on which were the words "Latter-day Saints." He asked one of the clerks what these words meant, and the clerk informed him that this was the name of a strange American religion whose representatives were holding meetings in the neighborhood. Out of curiosity, Brother Winder attended a meeting already in session. He crept up a back stairway and peeped through the banister. 'The sermon being giv- 569 en appeared to be directed so particularly to him that he could not resist its message. ""God moves in a mysterious way," and sometime later he felt impelled to join the Church. In September of 1848, being in his twenty-seventh year, he and his wife were baptized. With fervor he labored as a local parttime missionary for about four years and, in February 1853, set sail for the United States. It was not until the following October that he and his family reached the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, at the close of an eight-months journey. President Winder found that the Lord blessed him and he, in turn, used his talents for the promotion of the kingdom of God. This was a period in which there was need for making the Latter-day Saint settlements in the Intermountain country self-sustaining, as it was almost impossible to haul needed commodities with wagons from the Missouri River or the Pacific coast. Brother Winder became one of the vanguards of this movement, and engaged in so many varieties of industrial establishments that the space allotted for this lesson is insufficient to give even a short account of them. He became a partner of Brigham Young in establishing a tannery near the mouth of Parley's Canyon, from which came first-class leather. This, in turn, led to the establishment of industries to produce shoes, boots, saddles, and harnesses. He was active in the promotion of the manufacture of domestic sugar, both from beets and sugar cane. There was great interest in the possibility of establishing an iron industry in Utah, and he was one of the leading 570 figures in this activity. Lumbering, brick-making, dairying and livestock raising also engaged his attention, and he was one of the leaders in the Deseret Manufacturing and Agricultural Society. Ever alert to the possibilities of progress, he was active in railroading; and when the commercial use of electricity became a possibility, he was one of the leaders of the Pioneer Electric Company. Later he helped organize and became president of the Union Light and Power Company, now the Utah Power and Light Com: pany. These many activities made him financially independent and he found himself called to many positions of public trust. For a period of fourteen years he served as assessor and collector for Salt Lake City and also served as city watermaster for many years. Ina semi-arid country such as the Salt Lake Valley, the position of watermaster was a responsible one, demanding a person of sound judgment, one in whom the public had confidence, and a man with a sense of justice. These characteristics were possessed by Brother Winder and he was greatly respected. The great physical strength of Brother Winder is further made manifest in the fact that, in addition to his private interests and his public service, he was a bishop's counselor, later bishop of the Fourteenth Ward and, in 1887, _ was called to be second counselor to Presiding Bishop William B. Preston. In 1892, when it had been determined to rush the completion of the Salt Lake Temple so that it could be dedicated the next year on RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 the fortieth anniversary of its commencement, President Woodruff gave him the special assignment of raising the necessary funds for this purpose and supervising the completion of the work. He personally donated very liberally to this cause and after its completion was given the added responsibility of serving as an assistant to President Snow in the temple presidency, in addition to being a member of the Presiding Bishopric. } Faced with the choosing of counselors, President Smith selected this aged man, who had a wealth of experience in temporal as well as _ Spiritual matters. He was a captain of industry and an empire builder, both in a material sense and for the kingdom of God on earth. President Smith was determined to have the Church brought forth from obscurity into a new era of expansion and economic security, and~ President Winder was a man capable of giving counsel and leadership in this tegard. For nine years he served his President faithfully and passed from mortality on March 27, 1910. Anthon Henrik Lund At Aalborg, Denmark, on May 15, 1844, a baby boy was born who was destined to play a great role in the lives of countless people before his life closed in Salt Lake City seventy-seven years later.. This child was Anthon Henrik Lund. He had a remarkable mentality and gave promise of becoming a scholar of great renown.
