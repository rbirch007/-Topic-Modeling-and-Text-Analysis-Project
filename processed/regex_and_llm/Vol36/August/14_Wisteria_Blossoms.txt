d have brought them into the home to enhance the corner of a room or to fill an odd vase. The brown, velvety cattails, both small and large, combined with golden or biege stalks of ripened wheat or barley, make an unusually attractive display. Wheat barley, and grass are soft and wavy. Few people, however, realize their warm beauty, when painted gold and arranged in figurines or long, low. Bowls. The milkweed, with its cradle pod that curls in various shapes, is particularly interesting in a bouquet. The sturdy thistle, or burr, with the long prongs painted in either pastel or gold, provides a very fine focal point, while the common sunflower, 535 with its dried sepals and dried center, becomes an interesting unit in the arrangement. HE tumbleweed is a delicate piece when painted. It is very prickly to separate and paint, but rewards you for your effort by providing a pretty background for an arrangement. Fine, lacy plants, such as baby's-breath, dill, or mustard grass, painted in pastel shades, and combined with wild barley and wheat, make fragile, delicate bouquets. Dill is extremely fragile, but gives the appearance of tiny stars and is beautiful when: used in a table centerpiece. It should never be crowded so that the beauty of its form is lost in the bouquet. Another of the finer plants is the rattlesnake grass. 'This grows about as tall as June grass, turning tan or beige when dry. Although sealed when painted, there are little rattles on the end of each stem which, when dry, blow in the wind and treSwensen 536 semble the rattle of the rattlesnake. When you are in the canyon this summer, look for small, odd-shaped branches or long, well-shaped pine cones. The pine cones can be tipped with silver or completely dipped, and can be used in many clever ways at Christmas time. In displaying painted weeds, either flat or deep containers may be used. A little wallpaper cleaner provides an excellent frog, as the stems can be secured without breaking, and when the base hardens, the display is permanently placed. The base may be covered with silver tin foil, or small, colored pebbles, or even weathered stones. Many of the same rules that apply to floral arrangements can also be effectively applied to these glamourous weeds. Their combinations with each other are numerous, or they can even be combined with a few fresh flowers from your garden or some blooms from the florist shop in the wintertime when prices make a large display of cut flowers prohibitive. This, again, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 Swensen opens up another field for experimentation. There is a great deal of satisfaction to be derived from fashioning decorations with materials one has collected and preserved. Not only are they appropriate and practical, but they provide casual, economical and—yes, indeed—glamorous decorations. — Wisteria Blossoms Grace Sayre How may one keep this opaled sheen When fragile sprays will bloom? How may one keep this beauty whole And perfect as a feathery plume Upon a trellis, lifted up Against the sun's bright spell? How may one keep its fragrance pure But in the heart's deep well? For here each waxen bloom will shed A lilac-petaled grace— And here, beneath these arbored flowers? Hold back time's speeding pace, Remembering all the rainbow hues In early summer's night Where, pendant in the fragrant dusk, Wisteria sheds its light. Joanna 6 Margery S. Stewart CHAPTER 8 Synopsis: Joanna, who had married David Niels against the wishes of her family, is left a widow with four children to support and care for. Courageously, she takes inventory of her meager resources. A neighbor gives her a sack of navy beans and Joanna decides to make Boston-baked beans for sale. Another neighbor, Abigail Smith, offers to help with ideas and _ transportation. From a slow and unpromising beginning, they build a profitable business. Joanna decides that she must have a better home. Kent Taylor, acting temporarily as a salesman, shows her a house on a hill, which Joanna cannot afford to buy. Unexpectedly, however, she is offered $5,000 for her recipe for Boston-baked beans, and she buys the roomy, comfortable house. In order to attend a P. T. A. Meeting where her son is going to sing a solo, Joanna breaks a date with Kent Taylor just before he leaves town. Joanna and Abigail open a new store and Joanna finds her life enriched with many new friends and the abiding love of her children. For a famous young pianist, feeling richer than Croesus in gold and love. Her partner for the evening was Jordan Palmer, a teacher of English at the University. He was a solemn man who wore hornrimmed glasses and talked a good deal about the war in Europe. The conquest of Norway had filled him with a hot impatience. The group around him grew larger, their arguments warmer. Joanna listened, a chill creeping around her heart when he said, "We cannot stand aside and see small nations devoured. This is our world.. Eee went on to the party What good is it, if we are strong or tich when the rest of the world is hungry and exhausted? What men are we, if, being free, we stand quietly in our strength while weaker men are enslaved?" "Oh, it's all very well for you to talk," Joanna said hotly. "But our sons are the ones who must do the fighting. My David is eighteen " He bent his gaze on her. "That is the tragedy of this day." Joanna looked impatiently away from him and into a pair of eyes that smiled into hers in delight and welcome. "Kent!" she said, and her heart began a thick thudding in her breast. "Why, Kent!" "Joanna!" He stepped forward and took her hands. "I never dreamed of such luck, just running into you, my first night home." He smiled easily at Jordan Palmer. "You don't mind if I walk off with her? Joanna and I are very old friends." He drew her out of the group, smiling his easy, arrogant smile, to which people responded so quickly. She had forgotten how red his hair was, how very tall he was, but the golden peace that flooded her was familiar and beautiful. "You were away for a long time." "Europe. Finally found a place where I really fitted." He found two chairs in an alcove and held one for her. "I'm a newspaper man now." "T know.

I just wanted to know what the years had done to you. Years are so much kinder to men." He led her down to the car, seated her, and went around and slid under the wheel. "You will always be lovely, Joanna, good bones, and then you don't busy yourself." "Busy myself?" "So many women look busy, hair, gewgaws, make-up, like a crowded what-not shelf." Joanna chuckled, "And Mr. Palmer was saying on the way down that he loathed 'plain women,' who never wore a trinket to soften their austerity. You see, it's a wonderful thing that different men like different women." HE drove swiftly away from the house and up to the highway that hugged the mountains. "It's strange, Joanna, I didn't feel that I was home, until I saw you. I walked the streets I've walked a thousand times, and I felt a complete stranger. 'Then I went to the party and saw your face... And suddenly I was home and at peace." He took her hand from her lap and held it palm up in his own. "Tell me about the places you've been." She listened to him, the sound of his voice like waves washing over her heart. It's absurd, she thought, that this should happen to me. But it's been here all the time, this feeling for Kent... Ever since the first time I saw him. I never knew before that such things were. This is what musicians strive to put in their songs and poets into their writing. I'm thirty-seven. It's absurd. She struggled to release her hand. 539 "Don't, Joanna. This is night familiar. As if I had come home to 4 well-loved hearth." It was late when Kent turned the car in the direction of town. "Are you hungry? I'm starved." "I'm famished." Joanna peered out at the highway signs. "Let's stop here, "The Green Lady.' It's a new place. I've been wondering what it's like. They use my products exclusively."' "They seem to be doing a landoffice business." He eased into the parking area and after a search found a place for the car. Music spilled out of the building. They opened the door to its joyous beating, and to the quick laughter of young throats. The place was blue with tobacco smoke and acrid with the smell of beer. Joanna wrinkled her nose. "I don't think I'd like to eat here, after all." Kent nodded. "It is a dive. Im sure we can find something better." Joanna took a quick look at the dancers before she turned to go. The girls seemed incredibly young. They wore sweaters and skirts. Their hair shone silkily in the soft lights. Kent opened the door for her. A young boy, seventeen or eighteen, staggered in. He surveyed them blindly, stumbling into them. "Scuse me. But you ought not to get in people's way. Can't you see? I've something terribly important to do. Terribly lmportant... If I can jus' remember what it is." Joanna's heart reached out to him. He was so young, so appealing with his thick shock of brown, curly hair, and his thickly lashed blue eyes and 540 his white, square teeth. She wanted to shake him and send him home to a hot tub and a glass of milk and a good scolding. "Tom?" 'Kent's voice was sharp. "What are you doing here?" The boy peered at him. "Why if it isn't Kent Taylor." He shook his finger. "What are you doing, gallivanting around? I ought to take care of Dad's bosom friend." Kent took the boy's arm. "Better let me take you home." The boy shook him off. "Home, he says, home! Why, why it's just the shank of the evening. You've been old too long, you and Dad. Nowadays the young folks stay up all hours." The boy flung himself away. "Sure I'm stinko, but I've got a date n' everything. I'm a grown laddie, look at me." He floundered into the dancers and was lost. EENT' shook his head. "Brother! They seem to be starting younger every year." He held the door open for Joanna. She took deep breaths of the dark, star-flung night. "Let's just go home, Kent. I don't want people tonight. I don't want anything about this evening to be spoiled." He caught her hand and drew her close against his side. "You're different, Joanna, clean as wind and starlight and swift water.' In the dark shadow of the parked car he held her face in his hands. "I've wanted this moment since the first time I saw you." Joanna stood very still, waiting for his kiss. 'The wind ruffled her hair. She felt as though the whole night closed around her in RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 beauty, as though stars were wound in her hair and clouds were scarves for her shoulders. "T love you," Kent Taylor said. "I should have told you before. Think of me running second to
