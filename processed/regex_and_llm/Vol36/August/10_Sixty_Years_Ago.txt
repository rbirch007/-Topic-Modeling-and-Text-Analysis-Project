he problems of everyday life, marital problems, parental problems, and social problems. Several years ago I was returning from Sun Valley, Idaho. The bus to Shoshone was crowded with women who had been there holding a YWCA convention. There was only one seat left when I got on, and it was beside a very brilhiant and cultured woman. We fell into conversation and when she found that I was from Utah, and a member of the Latter-day Saint Church, she began bombarding me with questions that had been burning within her for many years— questions she had asked of many religions, for many years, without once receiving satisfactory answers. Fortunately, our religion has these answers, and I gave them to her to the best of my knowledge—for more than two hours. At the end of the trip she said: "I am so thankful that you sat beside me. It seems a miracle, but tell me, you must be older than you look, to have so much knowledge, to speak with RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 such wisdom and authority. How long have you felt this way and known these things?" I could not remember a time when I didn't have a_ testimony of the gospel, or understand the nature of God, and the working of his plans, and I told her so. But I thought about it afterwards, and I realized that this testimony had been gained gradually, by having my questions answered almost before I asked them. My mother was a thorough Latter-day Saint, and she subscribed to all the Church periodicals. I had access to them all. She never threw away a back issue of one of them, but stacked them in the attic hoping to have them bound. Our family was large, and privacy was not always possible. 'To gain it I sometimes went to the attic to think and read. I sorted out those magazines and read all the stories in all of them, faith-promoting incidents, and anything of a narrative nature. I learned the stand of the Church on the important principles of the gospel as they were illustrated in these stories. I never forgot some of them and their lessons became part of my thinking. I should like The Relief Society Magazine to be available to every Latter-day Saint. I should like my stories to carry the great messages of the gospel, and I should like them to do for others what these pages have done for me, for they have helped to give me the most precious thing I have in my life—a testimony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. and see jf yo; © Was stil] a SOner of War In Ep 1 U don't agree that oy.

The angel of life winds them up once for all, then closes the case and gives the key into the hands of the angel of the resurrection. EDITORIAL NOTES: When in Brigham City attending the Conference in June, Prs, Harriet A. Snow took the writer out to see the Sisters' granary, and it was a very great surprise to see how energetic the sisters had been, in building, and saving grain. It seemed such a model granary that we felt perhaps the sisters would like to have a description of it given to them in the Exponent. Mrs. Emilie D. Madsen has furnished some particulars. The dimensions of the granary are 43% feet long and 21% feet wide, 12 feet high, built of bricks and covered with an iron roof. It is divided into apartments so that the grain can be moved from one to another. The sisters have a considerably large quantity of grain stored, and prospects of more and it is to be hoped other settlements will take pattern from them and build substantial granaries and fill them with grain for it will surely be needed. JUAB STAKE: The forty-fourth Quarterly Conference of the Relief Society of the Juab Stake of Zion was held in the Nephi Tabernacle Friday June 21st, 1889. "We should cultivate our faith in the gospel and confidence in the Priesthood. No one should think her own example is unfelt or unnoticed. We should use the best of language, exercise as much or more faith and patience at home than anywhere. We are rewarded as we go along in the consciousness of doing right, besides the great reward we expect when our work is finished. The Lord has wonderfully blessed the Relief Society since its organization." Spoke of the storing of grain, and of the calamities that were coming upon the inhabitants of the earth. "We know the prophecies are being fulfilled, and we should be prepared to render aid temporally as well as spiritually." —M. E. Teasdale, Sec. Little by little the torrent said As it swept along its narrow bed, Chafing in wrath and pride. Little by little and day by day, And with every wave it bore away A grain of sand from the banks which lay Like granite walls on either side. EDITORIAL NOTES: Mrs. Zina D. H. Young, General President of the Relief Society left the city on Wednesday, August 7, on a tour through Beaver, Panguitch, and Millard Stakes.
