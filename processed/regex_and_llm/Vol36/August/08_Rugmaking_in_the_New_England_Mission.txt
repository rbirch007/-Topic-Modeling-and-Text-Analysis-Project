For sale. It was made by "Grammy." Grammy died last year, and this is all that she left to be remembered by. She was a "good hooker," was Grammy. 'Thus was the supreme compliment paid to one, old and dear, who had gone on before. She was a "good hooker." Later, at Cheticamp on Cape Breton Island, we entered a little shop conducted by a French woman. Hanging on the walls were rugs depicting scenes in the island, executed with such refinement: that they seemed finer than old world Inquiry revealed that these were hooked rugs, only, instead of cloth being used, wool yarn was the medium.. As we journeyed about in the Canadian portion of the mission, we inquired among the country folk for the people who were rug experts. We couldn't find them. On: Prince Edward Island in a little fishing village, there is a general store at which we managed to buy a hook. The cost wasn't much, thirty cents, or. So, but the storekeeper said that it-was machine-made and wasn't as good as those made by hand by Angus McDonald. Angus was a farmer, so we went out to his farm.. The quaint buildings were neat and clean and the wife of Angus was obliging, but Angus had been sick, hadn't made any hooks for a long time, and at the present moment was out on the Page 519. 520 Banks of Newfoundland on a fishing cruise. All of these excursions among the simple folk of the countryside made us all the more anxious to introduce this age-old craft for the use of the mission Relief Society. Examples of hooked rugs, created for sale to tourists, hung on clotheslines handy to the road. Most of these were far from artistic, no matter what could be said of them as rugs, but still people bought them. 'They could be made for a small outlay in money, and they would give our sisters another outlet. Sister Young was deRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 termined to revive the art in the New England Mission. And then she heard of Mrs. Pearl J. McGown of West Boylston. In a charming section of Massachusetts, Mrs. McGown lives and works at Rose Cottage. Certainly there is nothing else like it in New England. As we entered the front door, an assistant greeted us and began to show us around. On the floor was a rug of intricate design, with the warmth of an expensive Persian from the Near East. Our guide assured me that it was hooked. I couldn't believe it. "The stair runners are hooked," she ELIZA HARRINGTON OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT Sister Harrington, eighty-three years old, is an authority on hooked rugs and colonial quilts. She has one of the most complete collections of quilt-block patterns in Vermont. Interested in preserving for the future the patterns and designs of early New England handicraft, Sister Harrington finds great interest in this valuable hobby. She has an individual quilting frame, which permits her to complete a quilt without help. RUGMAKING IN THE NEW ENGLAND MISSION. Said. 'These were of a pattern and style in perfect taste, in pleasing color. As we went from room to room, the variety of uses for the hooker's art became apparent in seat Covers, purses, wall medallions, tapestries, and in floor rugs of all sizes, shapes, and descriptions. We saw chaitseat covers done so delicately that they rivaled the finest needle point. MB: McGown, a charming woman, supplies a good portion of the United States with both the incentive and the materials. She designs the patterns, dyes the cloth, supplies the dyes, frames, cutters, and general instructions for a host of women (and some men, I was told). She issues monthly bulletins on the newest discoveries and acts as the source of supply and inspiration for her enthusiastic followers. Her instructors, living in about twenty of the forty-eight states, are busily engaged in training women in the art and distributing the supplies from Rose Cottage. The crowning event in the Rose Cottage year is the exhibit of hooked rugs at Worcester in May. Here women enter for exhibition the finest examples of the art. Some tugs, only a foot or so squate, are delicate enough to hang on walls as framed pictures, while the largest examples run up to ten feet square, rivaling the finest the professional carpet weavers can produce. 521 In this exhibit is found the true art of the New Englander. When we visited the exhibition, about 300 Tugs were shown. Some were so well done that it is hard to believe that they were woven from strips of cloth, so natural and realistic were their flowers. Others, in addition, had great charm of combinations of colors. Delicate shading is the secret to be mastered. I am told that seven shades go into the making of one rose design.: The att of achieving this delicacy is the secret which all strive to learn. I was told that one extremely beautiful rug, about four-by-six feet, would easily bring one hundred dollars, at a sale, and that it was not unusual for the large eight-by-ten feet sizes to bring from $500 to $1000, if well done. One woman regularly sells her two-by-four feet rugs for seventy dollars. While I wandered around in the great crowd of women, hearing comment, criticism of pattern and design, words of approbation, and general good chatter, Sister Young was getting a short lesson on dying, and another on how to hook. Our sisters can become expert in this art, she thinks. With it, they can beautify their homes, help their pocketbooks, and bring new cash to the coffers of the little Relief Societies scattered over the mission. I think so, too. —_— Getting Acquainted Mary Rigby The funny thing about a smile, You wear it for a little while, And soon the strangeness all is gone— It seems to fit the face it's on. The Jumpher Family Part II—Randy Deone R. Sutherland HAT my sister Randy was going to be a glamour girl, or thought she was, as Richard put it, was very trying at times. "Especially since she is so young," said Papa. "She has never even been to an evening dance," said Richard, who is even younger than Randy, but older than I. "I never thought that I would produce a butterfly," said Papa one evening when Randy was practicing creative dancing on the living-room floor. Papa was listening to the radio. "I thought I was getting bad static," he said to Mama, "but it was only Randy bumping the floor." "Hugh!" Mama said. "Father!" said Randy. She had taken to the name Father about the same time she had taken to putting on lipstick. ] "You sure do miss your lips a long ways," Richard would tell her. "Well, it's hard to do it when I'm already late for school and I have to keep walking," Randy explained. It wasn't until Papa's job had let him move home again that Mama found out about the lipstick. Mama always thought that that was why Miss String had acted so odd when Mama visited the school. She had said something. About expecting Mama to be different—to be more— well, flashy. Mama kept wondering about that until Papa said he guessed Mama was hurt that she wasn't Page 522 flashy. But anyway, Randy did look changed with all that lipstick on at school. Sometimes the teachers would make her and the other older gitls wash it off, but Randy was very persevering. "Father," said Randy, "Father, don't you think you should read something else in the evening besides the paper?" "Why he does," said Mama; "he reads—" "IT mean literature. You ought to be reading great literature." Randy reached one arm over her head in a great swinging arc that ended in another jump and bump. "Why don't you read a little more in the evening?" Papa asked, folding back his paper. "T do have an art to work at," said Randy. "You should be more artistic, Father." "Tl try," said Papa. We all took dancing at the Weston Studios. It was recommended so that the children at our school could get acquainted and acquire social graces. Randy and Richard took ballroom dancing. Richard had to take it because the first day, everyone had chosen partners and nobody chose Randy. Randy cried all the way home. But after Papa talked to Richard, Richard told Randy he wanted to take it, and they could dance together sometimes until she got to know more people. "You!" said Randy with great THE JUMPHER FAMILY scorn, but she took him every Saturday. Randy's best friend at school came over to console Randy. "It's only because you lack glamour," she told Randy. "You don't even henna your hair, do you, darling?" "No, and you don't either," said Randy bluntly. "Well," said Lillian, "it's because I already have the kind of hair that has something." "Don't I?" asked Randy, standing in front of the mirror, pulling at her dark, straight hair. I lay on my twin bed watching them. I had been reading Alice in Wonderland for the thousandth or so time. Randy had been glad when Lillian came. "You can be so stuffy," she had said to me. "I guess it's because you're so young. You've never felt much. Lillian has suffered. I guess she's felt plenty." '""What's she suffered over?" I was curious. "She won't tell me," said Randy, "but she's older because of it. You can tell." was always going to ask Lillian what it was, but I never did. Besides, Randy might have got mad. She got mad over very funny things these days. "Well, if I'm ever going to get to dance with somebody besides Richard, I've got to do something," said Randy, staring at herself. She looked at Lillian. "The boys dance with you, Lillian. Why?" Lillian just smiled. So Randy kept working at it. It was very hard the week she decided that nobody danced with her because of the family. She wanted us to be more "modern." 523 "Lillian is shocked because you're all so normal," she told us. "None of you has got the slightest complex. You don't even act slightly queer. And the family's too big. If we could only hide Martin and Martha Jane when my friends come. Why don't we send them home to Grandma?" But Martha Jane began to cry, and Mama made Randy apologize, and Randy kissed Martha Jane and then Martin. Martin was in his playpen, and when Randy leaned over, he caught her hair and held onto it until Mama came and made him let go. Randy thought her creative dancing class would also help. If it didn't, she could still be a great dancer as a result of the lessons. 'Then Mama got her a permanent, but that didn't help very much, either. ) "Just be natural, Mama. "Lillian says to be mysterious," said Randy. "She says she read that all men like a feeling of mystery in women. I've been acting mysterious all week. Have you noticed a difference?" "Well," said Mama, "it is getting very hard for us to follow you all of the time, but I think I felt that there was something different about you the past week. But what I used to do, dear " "T know," said Randy, "be natural." "Well, yes," said Mama. "Well, after all," said Randy, "it only got you Father. I'll hit on something." And then all of a sudden it happened. Randy danced with one of the best boys in her class. "Ferg dear," said © again, not Matinee dances. He Pll no ev..
