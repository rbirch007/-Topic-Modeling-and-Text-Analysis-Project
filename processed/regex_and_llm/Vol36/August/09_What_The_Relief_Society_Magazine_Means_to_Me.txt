"Well, Ferg, I guess I'd like awfully to dance." And right in front of me she put her hand on his shoulder and he put his on her waist. Then he looked at his feet and they began the steps of the dance. But Randy kept smiling all the while, and it was as if we were home and she was smiling at Martin or Martha Jane or me. And I watched because she looked so different from the way she used to be. I saw Ferg look at her, too. "She's my sister," I told the kids from my class. We stayed for the whole afternoon, and Ferg walked home with us. Another boy wanted to also, but RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 Ferg made us hurry and we missed him. Randy kept smiling and when she'd look up real suddenly, I noticed how dark her eyelashes were. Like Mama's, I thought. Why Randy looks like Mama! My throat went tight, because there was Randy all different, all older. "Randy," I said, and Randy smiled at me. She's nice, I thought. She's nice like Mama, too. I looked at Ferg talking to Richard and staring at Randy. It was so easy now for Randy, she wouldn't even remember how it happened. I looked at the cracks in the sidewalk I was trying to miss, and then I looked back at Randy. She was very nice to look at, and I'd never even noticed before. Mount Nebo... At Nephi Georgia Moore Eberling The purple shadows drift across your face With wisps of fog as delicate as lace. The sunny meadows dreaming at your feet Are emerald, and redolent with sweet Red clover, and the mauve alfalfa blooms, And wheat fields nipple bronze and tawny plumes. I never raise my eyes to where you lift Your mighty head above the clouds that drift Across the sky, but that I think of him Who rests upon another Nebo's dim, Lone height, on far-off Moab's lonely strand, This side of Jordan and the Promised Land. Mount Nebo, calm, eternal vigil keeps Above the unmarked grave where Moses sleeps. Amphithea ter Ora Lee Parthesius Clouds peer over the mountain, Balcony-bare at its peak; Then peopled with pine-tree shadows, Balsams in rows at its feet-— Spectators, all—of the yellow Dotted with lush willow-green, Stage of tawny hay-wilderness, The actors the hawk and the crane. What The Relief Society Magazine Means to Me Alice Morrey Bailey (Address delivered at The Relief Society Magazine department of the annual general Relief Society conference, September 30, 1948) WELVE years ago I came to Salt Lake City determined to do something about my ambition to become a writer. I studied short story and poetry and joined groups that gave me help. Eventually, I took some of my poems to the editor of The Relief Society Magazine, who was then Sister Spafford. It would be difficult to tell you how timid I felt, full of hope one minute and overwhelmed with fear the next. I know now that this was a very unprofessional approach to a magazine, but Sister Spafford was very patient and kind with me, and took the trouble to look at my work and to evaluate it. I left her office with an understanding of the needs of the Magazine, and with the faith that I could produce work that filled them. In a short time some of my work appeared in The Relief Society Magazine and in The Improvement Era, and then it became published quite consistently often. Sister Spafford and I had a working agreement that I have always been proud of, and a fine relationship that encouraged me to do my best. Since then I have had many thniling experiences, many great occasions of happiness connected with it that I should like to tell you about, but time will not permit. When Sister Spafford was placed in the general presidency, I was selfishly dissapointed. I thought there would be an end to the lovely relationship I had built up with the Magazine, but that was not the case. I found that it countinued with Sister Sharp, and with Sistgr Crawford, that it is the spirit of Relief Society and of the Magazine. J am grateful for this relationship, and for the outlet for my writing that the Magazine affords me. I know now that it is one of many aims—to develop the talent of Latter-day Saint women, and I am grateful to Eliza R. Snow, who was a gifted leader in this field. I have found that the Magazine literary standards are high, and that its make-up ranks with leading magazines. I have heard publishers comment on this. I am proud to have my work in it, and feel that it goes all over the world to the most select audience that could be found —the Latter-day Saints, and not only to women, either. I have found that many men read the Magazine with interest. I do not feel that any better poetry is published anywhere than is published in The Relief Society Magazine. Page 527 528 Writing was not my introduction to The Relief Society Magazine, however. Most magazines are published with a view to make money. The Relief Society Magazine is an expression of vast amounts of work in many fields. It is impossible to think of it without thinking of Relief Society work and its many phases. I have taught and worked in Relief Society in the city and in the country whenever I could. I have seen the lessons bring strength and courage to women everywhere. I have seen them impart knowledge and culture and increase the talents and abilities of women, help them to cope with t
