You're English," Nan decided, loath to leave the subject. "You're the reserved type." "Not reserved, shy," Miss Tyndale corrected her. "Why once when I was a child Mother sent me over to Mortenson's to borrow something, and do you know what I did?" Nan shook her head. "When I got into the house, they asked me to sit down. I sat down so frightened I forgot what I came for. At noon when they set the table for dinner they invited me to eat. I knew I should go home, but I didn't know how to refuse. After dinner I went back to my chair. I guess I'd be sitting there now if Mother hadn't sent an older brother after 97 me. Miss Tyndale's face was momentarily sad, as if after all these years the gaucheries of the child still troubled her. "I can't imagine your being that shy." Nan moved closer to share the same bowl for her cleaned berries. She felt close to Miss TynRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 dale in spirit and wondered if now was the moment to ask her the question she had long wanted answered. She was aware that the moment might not come again. EPIDN'T you, when you were a girl, ever want to leave this?" she extemporized, moving her hand in an all-inclusive gesture. "I can understand now why it would satisfy, but when I was younger it didn't mean a thing." Miss 'Tyndale's hands were still for the first time, her voice very quiet as she said, ""That's one of the reasons I've always admired you, Nan. You weren't afraid to go away on your own. You made a place for yourself and found what you wanted in a strange world. Now, look what you've got." She gestured towards Winkie, busily engaged in stripping a hollyhock. "Of course I wanted to go," she replied, coming back to Nan's question, leaving the gooseberries still idle in her lap, "but I didn't know how to do it." "You should have married someone who would take you away." Nan did her best to give her words a casual sound. "It would have been easy then." Resuming her work, Miss Tyndale smiled. "I don't believe I ever thought of it like that. Anyway, I'd have had to come back sooner or later." She settled comfortably back in her chair and indulged in another of her deep chuckles, "Come to think of it, I might have gone away. I almost had a chance." It was hard for Nan to keep from crowding the edge of her chair.

I felt almost as if I were walking on holy ground when I walked through the large board meeting room and viewed the oil portraits of the women who had started and carried forward this service to humanity, as it is still being done. They were women of courage and vision and as each has handed the torch of leadership on to her followers, the same inspiration has been carried along, so that it touches the spirit of even a visitor such as I was. And so I said to myself, what can I tell these women of volunteer services? It is for me rather to learn from them. However, it is true that the Field Army of the American Cancer Society has a splendid record of service to humanity also, and for reasons of information, it is with pleasure that I set down a few of these accomplishments. The American Cancer Society was organized in 1913 by doctors and scientists, with a few laymen, who, motivated by the same unselfish spirit of the great doctors of our nation, wanted to make a concerted effort against the scourge of cancer. 'They began by surveys, pooling their knowledge, developing a program to increase medical facilities, and to further educate their profession in the nature of this disease. By 1936, they had a very good record of accomplishment, having developed facilities from about thirteen approved hospitals to over 300 approved hospitals and clinics. The great need now was to bring the public up-to-date on the knowledge and information which had been approved by the American Medical Association. 'There was no money for an educational program. The women of the nation were called upon to organize the Field Army for the purpose of educating the public. It was almost a hopeless task, for ignorance, superstition, and fear filled the minds of many people until few were even willing to listen to the program' of
