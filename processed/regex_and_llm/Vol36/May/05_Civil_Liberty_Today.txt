ng, though. I'm glad: Mama doesn't use them." Sister Nolte came out with a great package wrapped in papers. "The pig's head, freshly killed and cleaned. I am too gammel this year to take care of it. Maybe Mama can make head cheese? And some sausage; here is some sausage. You like sausage, Naaman?" "Oh, yes, oh, thank you Sister Nolte." "We had to kill early because of Maria's wedding. Oh, such a big wedding. Ly." "Sister Nolte, Mama is going to give you some of our crab apples for preserves." Christine knew the ways of Mama. "Your Mama iss. Bless Mama's big, brave heart." She touched the corner of her eye with her apron. "And the dollar. And for Donnie." She tucked Naaman's pocket full of cookies. Naaman snapped the dollar carefully in the purse and stowed it in his pocket. "Thank you, Sister Nolte, and goodbye." Naaman and Christine each put a knee in the empty wagon and coasted down the hill from the Nolte's. "Put on the brakes," cried Naaman at the base of the hill, dragging his foot. Your The whole town, near-— 297 "Here's where we spilled Donnie that day," giggled Christine. "And here's where we found the nickel to pacify him. Let's look in the dry ditch; maybe there's another one. I could use some of that candy." | Christine remembered the treat of spending the whole nickel. "One of these and two of those, no, three of those." They had pointed through the glass of the wondrous candy counter. "Oh, well, no luck today." Naaman climbed back to the wagon and pushed on across the street. Donnie came around the corner, limping slightly. He swished his willow and the last cow trotted two steps and ambled toward her own corral. "What happened to your foot, shrimp?" Donnie shied away from Naaman. "Nothing. It feels good." "Don't be scared. I've got something for you. A present." "Who from?" "From your best girl," Christine giggled. "Who? I haven't got any." "Guess," Christine commanded. "Trudy." Donnie dug the dust with his toes. "Donnie loves Trudy. Donnie loves Trudy," Naaman sang. "Now we know." Donnie raised the willow switch threateningly. "It's from Sister Nolte, Donnie. Give them to him, Naaman." Donnie tasted the cookies, disappointed. "They taste different." ATER, Mama prepared the supper soup. They knew what kind it would be. It was always the same. (Continued on page 356) Civil Liberty Today Elder G. Homer Durham Director, Institute of Government, University of Utah T is all too common nowadays | to take civil liberty for granted. Our forefathers could afford no such luxurious attitude. Most of the time, most of the people, in most of the world, have been slaves. Greek democracy at Athens was based on slavery. 'The Roman world knew little freedom so far as the majority of humankind was concerned. 'The nineteenth century, true, saw the expansion of civil liberty for significant, large groups of people, but chiefly in western Europe, the United States, and the British Dominions. Indentured servants and slavery in most western countries are now things of the past. Ownership of human beings has ceased to exist, generally, but new forms of control threaten the freedoms that flowered in the nineteenth century. In order that we of the twentieth century may have some appreciation of our general situation, we might consider the facts that in Virginia, in 1625, forty per cent of the population were indentured servants; that thirty-six per cent of the emigrants to Pennsylvania in the 1680's were bond slaves; that a Maryland statute of 1715 authorized not to exceed ten lashes "for any one offense'" committed by these indentured founders of our social structure! After a few years most of these servants became free, acquired property, and established themselves as significant members of society. Slavery, too, flourished in America until the Civil War, numbering, in 1700, about ten per cent of the population. Even among the humanitarian Quakers of Pennsylvania, the lot of the slave was not particularly happy, despite the fact that the leading figures of the abolition movement were eventually numbered among this group. A Pennsylvania statute of 1693 authorized any persons: To take up Negroes, male or female, whom they shall find gadding abroad on the first days of the week without a ticket from their master or mistress... And to take them to jail, there to remain that night, and that without meat or drink, and to cause them to be publicly whipped next morning with 39 lashes, well laid on their bare backs, at which their said master or mistress shall pay 15d. To the whipper (Curtis P. Nettels, The Roots of American Civilization, 1940, page 326). The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Together with the following nine amendments, this provision constitutes the Federal Bill of Rights. These amendments took effect December 15, 1791, some thirty months after the inauguration of George Washington under the new Constitution, framed in 1787, ratified in 1788, and put into effect in 1789.
