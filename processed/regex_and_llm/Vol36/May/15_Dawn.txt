g. But what could one do with a yard or so of chintz? Make luncheon and breakfast cloths, of course! Permanent-finished chintzes, picture-printed crash, cotton twills, and linens are all washable, and can be had from the sample table in the loveliest of colors and designs. Hem or fringe a quaint piece of flowered chintz, set out your collection of antique glass and china, and see what a charming table you have laid. Use a gorgeous tropical print in tones to blend with your breakfast pottery. You will find that the plainest of everyday china looks like something special when set on a striking sample square from the drapery shop. Braided Rugs—New-Fashioned Drucilla S. Howard OR an easier and better way of making the old-fashioned braided rugs you will need a large feed-sack needle and some stout string or carpet warp. You should be able to buy a needle at any hardware store. The rags are braided in the usual way. When ready to begin putting the strips together, fold the braided strip the length you wish the center of the rug to be, and with the needle, threaded with string, take up a loop of the braided strands, first on one side and then on the other. Always insert needle from top side of rug. Take up each loop, drawing the string snugly under each time. When working around the ends of the rug, take up two loops on the outside strand, (one on the inside) as many times as necessary to make the tug lie flat. When you have used up the string in your needle, tie the new piece of string to the end you have been using and thread the needle again. 'The knot can be pulled under the loops until hidden. The string will not show if pulled up snugly each time a loop is taken up. If you use two strips of cloth of different lengths in each strand you braid, it will not be necessary to sew the ends together. Just fold the ends ¥ one strip inside the other. Also the needle works better if it is not too sharp. = Spring Planting LeRoy Burke Meagher I followed the furrows which dad plowed up And helped with the seeding he had begun, By planting a sackful of corn which looked Like wrinkled-up pieces of autumn sun. The cool, moistened earth felt so good on bare feet And chunks of it stuck between all of my toes, As I walked along, with the sun on my back, And dropped little kernels of sun in the rows. Dawn Evelyn Fijeldsted _We hear a robin's soft ethereal call, A glad, sweet song at break of dawn, - And crocus blossoms, with their tears of dew, Like colored stars are sprinkled on the lawn. Page 317 Table Settings and Flower Arrangements Entertaining the Bride Mary Grant Judd Member, Relief Society General Board [This is the second in a series of short articles on table decorations, flower arrangements, and related subjects. In the coming months Mrs. Judd will present other suggestions suitable to particular seasons.—Ed.] INCE June is the month that more brides choose for their weddings than any other in the year, I want to give you, a month ahead, some ideas for announcements, showers, wedding receptions and so on.. When I think of brides, there often comes to my mind a line from "Peg O' My Heart," a popular play on Broadway in New York City years ago. So long ago, in fact, that I myself was about to be a bride. "In all this world,' remarked one of the characters who represented an older, experienced person in the play, "there's nothing half so sweet as love's young dream." That is why it is such a pleasure to plan social affairs for brides. Some of the joy that they are experiencing seems to spill over, and all of the guests, provided they have perennially young hearts, get their share. Putting first things first, let's talk about announcements. Although the actual announcement is seldom a surprise, it can be told in a surprising and orginal way. At one announcement luncheon, _ balloons were tied to ribbons attached to the stems of the flowers in the center of the table. Other balloons were at each place, and in them anPage 318 nouncements had been put before the balloons were inflated. When the balloons were popped, the announcements were discovered. Sometimes the news is tied in with the bride's background, with the business of the future bridegroom, or with the hobbies of either one of the bridal pair. To announce the forthcoming marriage of her daughter, one bride's mother, the wife of a doctor, passed around a good-sized prescription bottle filled with vitamin capsules in the largest size obtainable. These contained the names of
