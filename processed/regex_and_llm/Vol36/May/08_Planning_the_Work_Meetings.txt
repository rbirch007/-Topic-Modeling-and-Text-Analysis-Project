education or to read the available literature. The accomplishment of these women of courage, vision, and energy should be a matter of pride to all women. In ten years time, the attitude of the public toward the disease has changed greatly. Today magazines, newspapers, radio stations, etc., are co-operating to get the message to Mr. And Mrs. Average Citizen that "early cancer may be cured, through surgery, X-ray, radium;" to teach them the necessity of complete, periodic health examinations and to go to their family physician at once when any of the "seven danger signals" Page 305 This jg a notable feat in the field f Cati e that we SUN our work O tch that oy; Nation has ever known jg seekin Tecent SUIVEy Te the Causes of Cancer, new Means of veals that Only half of the Popula- 'A8NOsing jt, and additional] meth 10n of M€nca can 'Me a single o S of Curing it, Jy Is g Program early symptom of Cancer, that anyone May be proud to sup.

Planning the Work Meetings Leone G. Layton Member, General Board of Relief Society and Chairman, Work Meeting Committee ORK meeting leaders should begin planning their next season's (1949-50) work meeting program now. Each leader is aware of the needs and interests of the women with whom she is working and should, at this time, be able to make general plans for an appropriate program which will accomplish the purposes of the Rehef Society work meeting in her locality. Activity on this day should be planned with the following purposes in view: 1. To enable the women to give service in the Church Welfare Plan by assisting in filling the Welfare clothing budget assignment. 2. To give service to the ward Relief Society organization by participating in activities beneficial to the local society. 3- To foster and develop creative and homemaking skills. 4. To promote a feeling of friendly sociability within the group by working together in pleasant association. Each of these purposes should be considered fully in programming the day's activities in order that the greatest possible good may be gained from the meeting. Our first obligation on this day is to fill the Welfare clothing budget assignment. In doing this, we must be governed by the directions given us by the Welfare committee when the assignment is made. Let us plan to allow all the women an opportunity to participate in this service, that all may obtain the satisfaction and the development which come from so doing. Next, we should anticipate the local activities of our society for the year and include the preparation for these in our season's planning. If we contemplate a bazaar, let us plan ways to use this activity to forward the purposes of the work meeting. Through a bazaar we can interest our members and bring them into activity; we can recognize the skills of some of our older women and ask them to teach these skills to others; we can plan to use everyone along the lines of her aptitudes, interests, and skills. Special activities may be featured on various work meeting days, which will stimulate interest in homemaking and home beautification. The sewing course, which will be outlined in the July issue of the Magazine, may well be brought into the work meeting. Many of our mothers have need of this special instruction, and it may be given in such a manner as to interest the entire Relief Society group when it does not interfere with other planned activities. Fine quilting has become traditional in Relief Society. Let us plan to carry on this tradition by helping all to have an opportunity to learn and practice this skill.
