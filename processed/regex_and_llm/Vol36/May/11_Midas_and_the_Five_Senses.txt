The installment Payments, however, do not become less, EDITORIAL Finally, the housewife is forced to face her worry and anxiety and acknowledge that she was unwise to have bought more than she could pay for. Instead of the gay and friendly atmosphere she had hoped to create, she looks at her home almost with dislike. But long after she reached this conclusion, she still continues to scrape together her installment money. And it was then that the harried housewife voiced to her friend 31] the remark, "I could have fixed up the old things and would not have been half-sick with worry trying to pay for my new things." The Savior remarked at one time, "for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." 'The success of a homemaker does not depend on the newness nor costliness of possessions, neither does joy arise from imprudence and extravagance. M. C. S. Released to Spring C. Cameron Johns The earth is cushioned velvet to the tread And May has dressed her world in flowered lace; The gilding touch of sunshine overhead Makes miracles of all the commonplace. Even down the canyoned city street, Where stone and steel resist each growing thing, The little winds are blowing soft and sweet Releasing wintered spirits into spring. Midas and the Five Senses Lilacs After Rain Eva Willes Wangsgaard The spring returns the gold we lost In cups of daffodils, And golden lightbirds dip and rise Along the window sills. With gold to see and gold to touch Where water lilies float, And tinkling notes like nuggets tossed From every warbler's throat, A golden scent from hyacinths, And honey gold to taste, Five paths of gold lead to the heart. Come. Who would let it waste? Jeanette P. Parry Who has not loved the wild, sweet smell Of lilacs blooming after rain, Or walked a petal-covered path On fallen blossoms down the lane? So often I have picked bouquets, Dew-dripping, lavender, and white, And placed them in a pale blue bowl To lend their fragrance to the night. I have been far from haunts like these, Have stood in gardens fit for prayer, But still I hear the hum of bees And haunting perfume fills the air. Joanna Margery S. Stewart CHAPTER 5 Synopsis: Joanna, who had married David Niels against the wishes of her family, is left a widow with four children to support and care for. Courageously, she takes inventory of her meager resources and plans for the future. A neighbor gives her a sack of navy beans and Joanna decides to make Boston-baked beans for sale. Another neighbor, Abigail Smith, offers to help with ideas and transportation. From a slow and unpromising beginning they build a profitable business. Joanna rears her children with love and devotion and for Penny's fourteenth birthday she plans a special party. N leaden feet, Joanna went to () the door and opened it. She took a deep breath. "Darling," she said to Penny. She lifted her head. "My dears, I'm so glad you could come." "Hello, Mrs. Niels,' Connie said primly. Her mouth pursed as she sidled past Joanna into the room. Joanna saw the quick eyes inventory the kitchen range, the absurd decorations. "I'll have to leave early, Mother doesn't want me in this neighborhood after dark." "But we've lots of time until then." Joanna bustled about, taking their coats and scarves, saying whatever gay and welcoming thing popped into her head. The prayer beat in her throat, please... Please, for Penny's sake, let the party be good, not anything to mar her day, please. "Did you ever play "Witches'?" she asked them, pushing laughter through her stiff throat. "It's fun." She described it. Connie sat on the davenette and Page 312 smoothed her red velvet skirt. "I'd rather not. It sounds too childish." Joanna swallowed hard. "Very well. Let's play this one... Called 'Ghosts,' and if Connie doesn't like it, she can read'a book." She forced them into it, hiding the firmness under the banner of her laughter. She gave the gay prizes she had bought, with a flourish. Slowly, slowly, the ice melted and the girls came on her side. Laughter came spontaneously from young lips. After awhile Joanna could leave the room, go into the kitchen to put last-minute touches on the cakes and the ice cream. The shrieks and the clamor of excited voices were music to her ears. They ate their refreshments in an ecstatic silence. Joanna watched Penny's face. There was no cloud upon it, nothing to sully the clear joy of having her friends about her, of showing them off to her mother. But when the party was over and the young guests ready to depart, the clouds rose stormily again. Penny was helping Connie into the lovely coat. "Do come again, Connie. Come often." Connie's mouth pinched. "I'll try. But I'm afraid Mother will have a fit when she finds out where I've been." Joanna stuffed her hands into her apron pockets so they would not strike out at the pursed, pink mouth, the too-wise eyes that bade contemptuous farewell to the little room. Under her eyes, the decora- JOANNA tions, prepared at such a cost of time, grew pathetic, the slip cover faded and sagged. Joanna fought fiercely to bring back the gaiety. Don't you understand, she wanted to cry out, how precious a thing Penny's friendship is? The friendship of anyone who really loves you. What does it matter if they live in a tent, if they love you, they have value? Ruth, a black-haired echo of Connie, nodded her head. "But we really had fun," she said, in frank wonder. Joanna saw the darts had gone into Penny's heart. Her eyes darkened with pain. Joanna had the wild desire to step in front of her daughter, as if by so doing, she could take the pain into herself. She heard her own voice speaking, quickly, lightly, "I'm so glad you could all come. You see, we're moving into another neighborhood, and we might not be able to be together again." "Mother!" Penny lifted enraptured eyes. "You didn't tell me! When?" Joanna swallowed. "Very soon. It's to be a house on a hill, out of the smoke." Connie smoothed the sleeve of her coat. "That will be different. Mother will let me go up there." Joanna watched with the helpless amazement of the adult, as her daughter received this information with shrieks of joy. "Won't that be simply super! Just out of this world?" HEN the evening meal was over, Joanna sat enthroned among her children, while they gazed on her with adoration and awe. "You really mean it, Mother? 313 A big house! Room for everybody to have a room? Oh, Mother, it will be so wonderful." Joanna gulped and wondered if there was a place she could get with a down payment not to exceed three hundred dollars. ' "Tll have a room of my own," David said, "a place where I can study without the rest of you getting in my hair." "Your precious old books!" Sally was hostile. "What I want is a place to hang my pictures without everybody painting beards on them." She hugged Penny. "You can have your room, too, and write your poems in it." "Poems?" Joanna turned to Penny. 'The girl's face was scarlet. "Sally! Why did you have to tell?" She rose and ran toward the bedroom. ""They're awful! Awful!" "Poetry." Joanna caught her breath. But of course, she should have known, Penny would never be one to hoard beauty, it would pour out of her like light, into other people's lives. "Poetry..:. I'm so glad." Abigail came over after supper to help with the night's work. She listened eagerly to every detail of the party, pausing in her kneading to look at Joanna's face. She made Joanna think of a silver-haired girl, in her ruffled blue apron. 'There was something young and wistful in her listening. But when she heard about Connie, her outrage knew no bounds. "You should have told her to go home! 'That's what you should have done. The idea! 'The very idea! What's the world coming to?" 314 Joanna sliced apples into a pie shell. "I don't know. When I was little, a party was an event. We talked about it for months, before and after. I can't remember ever noticing a house, or taking inventory of the cost of things." "It's their mothers!" Abigail said shortly, "putting their own snobbish ideas into their daughters' heads." "I I told them we were moving into a new house." Joanna looked up at Abigail. "I had tox, "Humph," snorted Abigail, "so they defeated you, the brave Joanna, who hasn't been downed by hurricane or famine, going down like nine pins before a bunch of little girls. I thought you were going to buy some new equipment?" "T was,' Joanna said unhappily. "I was going to do so many things. I was going to buy a small bakery and start out with just breads and pastries... A real shop." Abigail blew a curl from her forehead. "Well, you can still do it. The children can just wait for their house." Joanna set her chin. "No. The children need a home. A real one. Penny will need one more and more. I can't bear to have her left out, or have less than the others. She has a right to things. Poetry. Just think of it, Abigail, she's writing poetry." Abigail said softly, "Well, 'm not surprised. I've often told my Henry. 'Henry,' I've said, 'there is one person whose mind I wouldn't be afraid to look into. Penny Niels' mind would be like a flower garden, that sweet, from the looks of her and the things she does for her mother, and the gentle way she RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 talks! Just like a flower garden,' I told him." Joanna came around the table to hug Abigail's | plump — shoulders. "You see, we have to give her lovely things, a chance in life." Abigail patted Joanna's hand. "We'll do it, my dear." OANNA stood at the kitchen table, the next afternoon, wrapping fresh loaves of bread in wax paper; the pale October sun splashed warmth across her hands and on the kitchen table. A woodpecker swung on the lower branches of the apricot tree, just outside the window. Someone knocked at the front door. Joanna impatiently finished the bread she had started and went to answer it, not pleased to have visitors interrupt her busy day. She frowned at the tall, red-haired man who grinned at her from his great, lean height. "Mrs. Niels?" "Yes, but I " return his smile. "You're busy, I know I'm Kent Taylor, and I understood that you are in the market for a house." Joanna's mouth dropped gently. "But, good heavens! I just made up my mind yesterday." "T know," he said, "I read minds by television. You want a house on a hill." Joanna laughed, reluctantly. "I suppose you know how much, or little, rather, I can afford to pay down?" He shook his head. "I never inquire into my clients' private affairs, such as love, money, or pet peeves. May I come in?" He She did not JOANNA sniffed the air, "It smells like a small corner of heaven." Joanna, leading him into the kitchen, wished suddenly she was wearing her new, high-heeled shoes, instead of the brown, flat brogues, She watched his eyes light up when he saw the crusty brown loaves on She | said, hesitantly, "Would... Would you like a slice of fresh bread and some strawberry Jam?" His grin was quick and pleased. "Would I? I don't believe I've ever tasted fresh, homemade bread in all my life - Mother was a Career woman.... Real estate. She and my sister are Tunning the business together. I'm home on vacation so they put me to work." He took a deep bite out of the slice of bread and jam. Hi "Brother! Now J see what people mean. This isn't the first time I've tasted your products. We had some Boston-baked beans last night. My sister was telling me about you my niece, too. In fact it was our charming little niece who told us you were in the market for a house." "Your niece?" "Uh-huh, Connie, she was here to a birthday party." "Oh," said Joanna. He looked around "You
