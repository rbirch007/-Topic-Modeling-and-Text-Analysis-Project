Ae ated Autumn Margaret B. Shomaker A strange enchantment lies upon the land, As leaves from green to golden yellow tum And nature smiles to touch with magic hand Emollient balm to leaf-thin tree and fern. And in the blue sky overhead is swung A golden harvest moon to lead and light The way for shoals of tiny stars among The cool, gray shadows of the autumn night. Encircled low, the bending meadow grass Is tiny flutes, with music liquid clear To catch the sparkling sunbeams as they pass. Bright symphonies of earth and sky cohere Until each flower, bush, and tree is told To wrap the autumn day in fragrant gold. Page 586 Tempered PART I Gladys I. Hamilton ARNET BLENDALL tried to appear natural as she stood on tiptoe to kiss her husband, Lee, goodbye. Then, quite casually, she plucked a minute speck of lint from her father-in-law's rough whipcord coat. Her blue eyes were sad, and within herself was a cold numbness, overlaid with a sincere regret and an aching weariness. Only she knew that her kiss was to be a final one as Lee's wife. Her marriage had failed and she was running out! Senior Blendall, known to his associates as "Old Granite," cast his fierce gray eyes skyward and temarked, 'A weather-breeder, Lee, sure as you're born!" 'Then he turned to the quiet woman in the wheelchair, put his hand tenderly on her shoulder and pressed gently. "Well, so long, Mother." "Be careful, Grant." His wife's thin voice quavered slightly, then her eyes turned toward her tall son. "Take good care of your Pa, Lee. He's always so careless of hoof and horn when he goes to the stockyards," "T will, Mom," Lee promised, "but you and Garnet are the ones to take care of yourselves while we're away." A worried look flicked across his fine bronzed face as he bent to kiss his invalid mother. 'Then again, with almost an air of shyness, he caught Garnet up to him in a great, crushing bear hug. "We'll only be gone three hoe Honey. Smith'll look after the chores for you. You won't need to worry about any of that." But old Grant turned at Lee's words and glared at his daughterin-law. "Don't you forget to remind Smith about that special feed and clean bedding for those new cows." "I won't, Father," Garnet promised for the fourth time since the men had planned to ship the yearlings to Denver. The new cows in question were Shorthorns, and the small beginning of still another sideline on the broad acres of the Blendall Ranch, two registered females and a very young calf, from one of the nation's foremost breeders. 'They were valuable, and very dear to the elder Blendall's heart. Most of the three thousand acres of "Wheatlands" was utilized for raising wheat and feed for the beef cattle. Lee and his father managed the entire ranch with the help of a hired man, Smith, who lived with his family at the far edge of the ranch. After they left, Garnet went about her work as usual. Mother Blendall talked little when her men were in the house, but she spoke scarcely at all when she was alone with her daughter-in-law. Her great brown eyes were the most alive thing about her, and at times they seemed to speak volumes that the unaccustomed lips could not voice; then again, they were blank and unreadable. "How can I make her like me?". Beat incessantly in Garnet's mind. Page 587 588 "What is she thinking? Why won't she let me show her that I really want to be one of the family?" OTHER BLENDALL was not entirely helpless, for she had the use of her hands to sew, knit, or prepare the vegetables each day. Moving about in her chair, she worked hour after hour in silence. "A weather-breeder.... What did Father mean by that?" Garnet spoke with an interest she did not especially feel, but anything was better than this silence, broken only by the incessant clicking of those steel knitting needles. "I never saw a more beautiful December day! It's as warm and clear outside as a crystal ball. Why, the mountains seem close enough to touch." Garnet looked out at the blue-white day. The needles clicked on. A log in the fireplace broke with a snap. The old-fashioned striking clock ticked loudly. Garnet had about decided that the older woman would not be drawn into trivial conversation. Then, finally, Mrs. Blendall spoke. "There's weather coming. I feel it." There was another silence, then she continued, "A still, toowarm day in winter means wind or snow or both, here in Colorado." "The expression was new to me " Garnet said. "T'm sure it was!" came the short reply. Garnet could almost feel the words she knew her mother-in-law was thinking. What would a frilly, city doll know about weather-breeders, or Shorthorns, or spring wheat or any phase of farm life? RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 Garnet smothered the sigh of defeat that rose to her lips and went into the large, sunny room that was her own and Lee's. It was the only place where she ever felt the least bit like her old self. She pulled the heavy calfskin cases from under the bed and finished the packing she had started earlier. She planned to leave about two hours before the men returned. That way Mother Blendall would not be alone for very long. She would also ask Mrs. Smith to sit with her for awhile. These first months of her marriage had been so difficult and bitter, yet very sweet, too, for she loved Lee with all her heart. But even that love could not help her endure the gruff insults of her father-in-law, nor the impassive, antagonistic silences of Lee's mother. Mother and Father Blendall had been shocked when Lee married the little Southern girl whom he had known but two short weeks. Just a "thrill bride" they called her, but Lee and Garnet both knew that two weeks—or two years, it would have made no difference, it would still have been the same tender, enduring love. They were happy and carefree when they went home to Wheatlands, but the scene which followed her advent into the Blendall family would be a hard one for Garnet ever to forget. During the course of words and burning looks, she learned that Lee's father and mother had fondly dreamed that he would some day marry "Micky" Donaldson, a sturdy, capable neighbor girl who rode broncos like the wind, and handled TEMPERED her tractor as expertly as her coupe. She even owned her own plaue! ICKY was a marvel of efficiency, while Garnet was as inexperienced and inadequate as a singing canary! She might be pretty, and sweet, and happy-natured, but she wasn't made for vigorous farm work, "You need a wife and a helpmeet... Not a little, deep-South, sho' nuff belle," old Grant had roared. She remembered how Lee's mouth had set, and his chin squared out at his father's words. "How do you know that she isn't both, Sir? Give her a chance to show you what she can do, before you condemn her. She at least is willing to learn!" "Please, Mother and Father Blendall," Garnet cut in, "I love Lee, and I do want to make him a good wife. And you a good daughter." The explosion ended then and there, but she had only been patiently endured, never accepted wholeheartedly into the family. Lee's position was far from comfortable, she knew, torn between two obligations, as he was. And as time went on the breach would widen until he would be forced to take sides, a difficult thing to do. Lee's parents had been married for ten years before he was born, the only child of their union; and then they were no longer young. His mother had been a cripple ever since. So they had relied upon him and his young strength for everything. The two long years that he was in the army, were times they never spoke about, and only Smith saw and knew the loneliness they endured. 589 Some of it Smith told to Garnet. She felt like a guilty interloper. So, before she caused any more unhappiness, she intended to take herself out of Lee's life, before their love for each other turned to bitterness and disrespect. And she would keep her child, the baby that could, by the very laws of nature, hold them all together by that one common bond, regardless of mutual love or admiration! The child, who had so recently made its existence known to her and of whom, as yet, Lee was entirely unsuspecting. Garnet drew a mental curtain across the painful memories, the resentment and dislike, which she had never been able to overcome. She tried to shut out the recollections of happiness which she and Lee had found in their love. Perhaps, later, things would be different. But now, she must carry out her plans. She must leave Wheatlands. She fastened the cases and shoved them back under the bed. Over by the window, gazing out across the golden stubble of wheat toward the blue expanse of mountain peaks, she realized how very much she had grown to love this country of the plains. The ever-changing mood of clouds and shadows on Pike's Peak to the north, the brilliant sunshine gleaming all around her on the golden fields. ART of the sky was darkening. Great, ragged clouds rolled over the saw-edged peaks like tumbleweeds in a gale. By four o'clock, the wind was sharply cold. Within another hour the country was gripped in an icy blizzard, with the 590 wind shrieking around the comers of the house, whistling in the eaves like a lost banshee, and rattling window panes dangerously. Snow fell in hard, little ice pellets. It was all that Smith could do to make the distance up the hollow to do the chores. He coughed hoarsely. "It's a very bad night, sure, Mrs. Lee," he offered as he gave Garnet the warm milk to strain and cool. "Just give me a ring if you an' Mrs. Blendall need any help." "T will,' Garnet promised, glad that the phone was a link with people who knew and understood this beautiful, but sometimes terrifying county. "By the way, Smith, did you bed down old Chub and Buttercup and little Wobbly-legs? We must make sure, you know," she ended with a meaning little smile. Her unoriginal cow names were even new to him. "You mean the Shorthorns?" he asked. Garnet nodded. "T sure did!' Smith said, "just like Mr. Blendall told me to." "Thanks. Father is particular where his stock are concerned." They smiled together at old Grant's idiosyncrasy. "Take good care of that cold, Smith," Garnet called after him through the storm. The women ate their lonely supRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 per before the open fire. Garnet sat on the hassock at the older woman's feet and wished that Lee were home. She wanted his strong, hard arms around her shoulders; she needed his understanding companionship to quiet her fears, his lips on her hair, telling her he loved her. > "Like this new gingerbread recipe, Mother? I used a new brand of molasses. It's milder." Garnet was always trying new, tempting dishes to please the mother whose days seemed so monotonous. But beyond a few words or nods, Garnet never knew whether her mother-in-law approved of her cookery or not. Her sincerest overtures were almost always ignored. Once Garnet had walked two miles to pick strawberries from a neighbor's garden so that Mrs. Blendall might have a shortcake, and her only comment, after Garnet had gone to all the trouble, had been, "Plain food's best." The wind continued to howl its fury, and did not lessen. Garnet was afraid. The big walnut bed was cold without Lee, cold and empty. She reminded herself that she might just as well get used to the loneliness, used to the fact that only a smooth expanse of cold sheet would greet her arms each night after she severed the bond of her hasty marriage.

Better Photography Willard Luce HOTOGRAPHY is without question the number-one hobby in America today, possibly in the world. Literally miles of film are used every year, pictures of people, pictures of trees and mountains and rivers and lakes, pictures of buildings and streets, pictures of everything. Magazines are filled with them, albums are filled with them, drawers and boxes are filled with them. And perhaps it should be so; for they are recorded fractions of time which will never return. The people, the scene, the earth will never be. Exactly the same again as it was during that one instant of exposure. The sad part is not that the film is used, but that too much is used, too much wasted. Not that fair pictures are not made, they are; but ten good pictures are far better than a hundred fair ones. Anyone can take fair photographs. Anyone can also take good pictures with just a little more time, a little more thought, and a little less film. If film cost ten times what it does, the average snapshooter would be much more critical about how he used it. Instead of snapping a hundred shots and hoping the law of average would give him a few worthwhile pictures, he would take only ten and get far more good pictures among those ten than among the hundred. And you don't need an expensive camera! For the average person, most things can be photographed as effectively with arbox camera as with a more expensive instrument, although the box camera has many limitations, as mentioned below. When used within these limitations, however, it is a very effective, picture-taking machine. Tt cannot, usually, be used for anything closer than six feet even with a portrait attachment. And then it is difficult to get the proper composition, for what you see in the view-finder is not what you get on the film, due to what is called parallax. But, anyway, there is little the average person would want to photograph closer than eight feet. The box camera isn't effective on cloudy days, because of exposure. The regular snap is too short and we, as humans, are too slow to open the shutter set on time and close it again without burning up the film. This really isn't as serious as it seems, however. Few cloudy day photographs are effective anyway, and, in America, there are far, far more sunny days than cloudy ones. I understand some of the new color films can be used in box cameras but, I am afraid, not very satisfactorily since the exposure of color is so critical. Before trying it, I would consult a good photo dealer for instructions. HEN the box camera doesn't give critical enough focus for big enlargements, but for the average person wishing snapshots for his photo album, that is hardly a limitation. Page 591 592 Willard Luce CLOUDS AND TEMPLE SPIRES Infra-red film and a red filter create dramatic cloud effects. Regular panchromatic film with a red filter will also give a very dark sky and white clouds, but the foliage remains dark. Panchromatic or orthochromatic film, with a yellow filter, will give you normal sky correction. There is, however, one quite serious limitation of the box camera— that of exposure. The exposure of the camera is so calculated as to get a picture in sunlight, but there is a great deal of difference in sunlight. At high altitudes, for instance, the sunlight is much more intense than on the coast. For that reason a film can be exposed in high altitudes a much shorter time. As a result, a great many negatives taken with a box camera are badly overexposed, which burns out most of the details and the beautiful gray tones. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 This, however, can easily be corrected by using a yellow filter which will also darken the sky and bring out any clouds which might be there. If you haven't a yellow filter and one seems too expensive, a piece of yellow cellophane held over the lens will do just as well. Very dramatic cloud effects can be created by the use of infra-red film and a red filter. This gives a black sky, black shadows, and white foliage. A fairly long exposure, plus the need of a slightly longer & Willard Luce NIGHT OVER ZION This night photograph was taken with a box camera. The slight distortion here was caused by pointing the camera upwards while making the exposure. Taking the picture from across Main Street and enlarging only a section of the negative helped make the distortion less noticeable. The camera was placed on a mailbox while making the exposure. S F Willard Luce A FRAME OF FOLIAGE Note the effect of the foliage in the picture. Proper framing greatly enhances any photograph. 594 distance between the lens and the film, makes infra-red photography unsuited for the box camera. I have seen, as I'm sure you have seen, hundreds of pictures having a person standing facing the camera with a building or a mountain in the background. Here you have not one picture, but two, the picture of the person and the picture of the building or the mountain. The center of interest is divided, and both fight for attention. With an expensive camera the background can easily be thrown out of focus. But if the building in the background is going to be fuzzy and distorted, why have it there at all? Why not, instead, photograph the person against a smooth wall, or, better still, against the sky. Either makes an excellent background for a personality shot. It isn't fair to the person or to the scene to attempt to give them both equal importance within the framework of the same photograph. Excellent pictures can be made including both, if the person is looking at the scene and not at the camera. This actually directs the viewers eyes to the building or the scene, giving it more importance. Photographing a building when close to it creates what is called distortion. This is caused by the fact that the bottom of the building is much closer to the camera than the top, which causes the building to appear to be leaning or falling backwards. This is often used by top-ranking photographers to create an ef-— fect. In a salon print, properly mounted, it is often very effective. In most album-sized prints it is RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 usually only distracting and disturbing. It is we
