It is a record of achievement reflecting the teamwork of women from all walks of life and in all parts of the world, banded together in one great cause. The activities of 172 stakes (all the organized stakes of the Church as of December 31) and 37 missions are reflected in the report. The reports were especially well prepared; 25 stake reports and four mission reports were perfect, while 125 stake and 22 mission reports required only a few minor corrections, and the narrative sections were both interesting and informative. For the first time since the war, reports were received from all foreign missions that had been deeply affected by war, and we are pleased to note the strengthening and expansion of these sister societies. An increase of 3,843 members in 1948 brought the total membership to 115,686, exceeding by 671 the membership of 1941, previous high mark, attained through an intensive membership campaign in anticipation of the 1942 Relief Society centennial. Some members did not continue their activity after the centennial year and war conditions were responsible for a further decline until the end of 1945. The recovery shown in the 1948 report, therefore, represents a steady and wholesome growth since the close of World War II. A Church-wide average of 37,644 members (32.53%) attended the regular weekly meetings and benefited from the educational program. 'Theology and testimony meetings continued to attract the largest attendance, with literature holding second place, social science third, and work meeting fourth, although the most notable increases occurred in work meeting with an increase of 2,295 (6.76%) over 1947, and social science with an increase of 1,946 (5.66%). The most outstanding achievement of 1948 was the gathering of the fund for the erection of a Relief Society Building in Salt Lake City. Women from all over the world, many of whom will never see the building, gave generously of their time, talent, and funds to reach the goal of $500,000, which was oversubscribed. Compassionate service continues to increase, indicating that the society is ever widening its friendly and sympathetic attention to the alleviation of human suffering. The extent of these services is revealed by the following figures: 1,592,434 monthly visits made by 37,528 visiting teachers in 21,752 visiting teacher districts, in which inspirational and comforting messages were delivered; 5,910 initial family visits and 9,349 follow-up visits made by ward presidents to needy families; 163,408 visits to the sick and homebound and 19,636 days care of the sick. Beyond the facts and figures cited here is something bigger—a testament of faith that the world sorely needs—a great, practical demonstration of brotherly love. The general board is deeply grateful to all who have contributed to the advancement of Relief Society during the past year, to officers and members alike, for their tireless and devoted service to the betterment and enrichment of human life, General Secretary-Treasurer Illustrated by Dorothy Platt Handley.

"Oh, Mother, isn't life simply magical?" "IT must see this paragon you're dating," Joanna said. She rushed in and out of the tub and dressed swiftly. The white dress was the most becoming thing she had ever owned. She put on the gold slippers and went downstairs. Penny whistled. "You look out of this world, Mother." She was sitting on the hassock, her slim hands clenching and unclenching on the velveteen skirt. Joanna bit her lip. How well she remembered the pangs that went with a first date, the clammy feeling of inferiority. "'Rest assured, Penny, you'll look as swish as any of them. Where is the party to be held?" "IT don't know. It's just a patty, I guess. Mother, are you sure I don't look babyish in this collar?" A car stopped. Penny sprang to the window, her face flushing. "It's Tom! Quick, Mother. How do I look? Is my hair right?" She did not wait for an answer but ran to the mirror above the little table in the hall. She opened the door on his ring. Joanna sat very straight, trying to beat down the chuckles. I must look very friendly, she thought. The poor lad is probably in stitches of fright, too. Penny brought the boy in, her eyes dwelt on him, soft with adoration. "Mother, this is Tom Tom Nichols." Page 624 "Oh!" Joanna felt as if she would be sick. She stared at the boy, his dark, curly hair, his clear, thickly lashed eyes, his clean young mouth. Incredible that this should be the drunken boy who had lurched into her at the "Green Lady." The "Green Lady!" She had a swift vision of dancing girls... Penny's age, and the smoke and the raucous laughter. But surely this was different. She wet her lips. "Where do you plan to spend the night hours?" Flippant, not the frightened mother speaking. The boy shrugged a gray tweed shoulder. "Here and there. The crowd has things planned." "Tl run upstairs and get my coat," Penny said. She had spent hours wondering if she should have 'it ready in the living room, or if it would look as if she didn't really care whether she went or not, if she left it upstairs. OR a wild moment Joanna thought of fainting... Of putting her hand to her heart and complaining of a sudden devastating pain. She said dully, "Wait a minute, Penny. I don't believe youll need your coat." "Mother!" Penny came close, her eyes large with anxiety. Tom stirred impatiently. "The gang is waiting for us, Penny." Joanna said dully, "They will have to wait. Penny cannot go." "Oh, Mother!" The young agony was like a knife hurled into her heart. Joanna turned to Tom. "You JOANNA see, I was with Kent Taylor, at the "Green Lady."" You were well, intoxicated. I I can't let Penny go to such places. She means too much to me." She saw Penny's white, imploring face lifted to Tom's. They were against her, youth, laughter, the sweet, hot call of adventure allied against her age and experience and her love. Tom © shuffled uneasily, "Aw, gosh, Mrs. Niels. We were just having fun. We didn't mean anything. I promise not to touch anything tonight. What will the bunch say if I turn up without my date?" "What will they say about me?" The cry was tor from Penny's heart. Joanna ran her fingers through her hair. What to do? If she sent Tom away, it would take years before Penny would trust her again. She might not bring her friends home, she might tell them to meet her elsewhere. It was obvious Penny was in love with the boy. First love, but real enough. Joanna lifted her face. Tom said, "Gee! I wouldn't let anything happen to Penny." "IT can't let anything happen to her," Joanna said and smiled. Suddenly she looked at them. "Listen, would the gang mind changing places to go? I mean, how would they like to come here. We've a brand new batch of records, we can roll up the rugs, and I'll make you all a lunch you'll never forget. What about it?" They looked at each other, Tom and Penny. Joanna read their faces. They knew she would not let Penny go. To go without her meant loss 625 of face to Tom. The only solution was to make the best of a bad bargain. "We'll stay. We'll make the gang think we thought the idea up ourselves." Joanna was weak with relief. "Good for you! And by the time you get finished with one of our parties, you'll not be able to wait for the next one." "Okay! Ill run and get the others." He grinned at Penny and patted her arm. "It's all mnght," he said. The doorbell rang. Joanna turned to it. Kent. Kent! She went to the door and opened it. His eyes deepened when he saw her. "Beautiful," he said. "Are you teady, darling?" "Kent I can't go." She drew him with her into the kitchen and explained. He waited patiently until she had finished, but she saw his eyes growing colder and the sharp lines that came when he was angry springing up on his forehead. "Can't you come with me, and let the youngsters have their own party?" "No. No, Kent. I have to stay here... See that it is a success. A terrific success. So they will want to meet here, again and again. It has to be more fun than the "Green Lady,' or any of those places." E slapped his hat against his side. "Second place. Ill always take second place to the children. I'll be glad when we are back East, so I can have you to myself for awhile." Joanna straightened her shoulders. 626 She felt bowed to the earth under the weight of this burden, and though Kent stood before her, she was already lonely, the chill of it on her heart. "I'm not going back East with you, Kent. I can't leave Penny now." He dropped his hat and put his hands on her shoulders. He shook her. "Not going with me? What stupid thing is this? Of course you're going with me? I need you." "Penny needs me." "You promised you would come." He dropped his hands. "Joanna, you can't give your life to your children. Your whole life. You have a right to happiness." Joanna said heavily, "Only if it doesn't interfere with their lives. Oh, Kent, believe me, this is hard to say, but you don't really need me, not as Penny does. There wouldn't be a moment of peace for me. This is my job." He said savagely, "Your job! What pay will it give you? They'll leave you, Joanna. Every one of them will leave you. Penny is going now. She's running away into her own life. You can't stop her." "No," Joanna said. "I wouldn't want to stop her. But I must help her into the kind of life that will RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 be rich and rewarding. Oh, I've heard about interfering mothers. I've read that we have no night to interfere in our children's lives, but I don't believe it. Should I spend sixteen years perfecting a thing of beauty and then close my eyes while the world takes over? Did I leave her alone when she learned to walk, or did I help? She's in love, Kent. To go away and leave her alone now would be like giving her a stick of dynamite to play with, hoping she wouldn't find matches." Kent picked up his hat. He said wearily. "I can see that staying would be utterly useless, and talking even more so." He looked about him. "A home. Well, I'll be too busy for a home for a long time to come." Joanna watched him go, his head held arrogantly and high. Then she turned and went heavily upstairs. She took off the gold slippers and the white jersey gown and found a blue dress and an apron. Penny was waiting alone for the return of Tom and the gang. Joanna went to her and held her close, feeling Penny stiffen against her. "It's going to be all right, Penny. Believe me. It's going to be all right."

In addition to the stake Relief Society presidents, other guests were the ward class leaders and ward and stake officers, members of Granite Stake presidency and their wives, a member of the high council, and representatives of the stake boards of all the other auxiliaries in the stake. Sister Blanche B. Stoddard of the Relief Society general board also attended the luncheon. President Ida M. Dean welcomed the guests and introduced the former presidents. A delicious luncheon was served, followed by a program of music, speeches, and readings. The table decorations were particularly attractive and significant for the occasion. Along the table were low white picket fences covered with climbing roses, through which arched gates swung open. At each gate stood a beautifully dressed doll. The favors at each place were small arched gates, decorated with pink flowers. At each gate stood a dainty miniature paper doll. Carrying out this artistic and thoughtful idea, Sister Dean read a poem which she composed. Parts of the poem are quoted below: "Dear friends, may we take you in fancy, down a pathway strewn with flowers Into an enchanted garden, and there spend a few happy hours ** & *€ So enter the open gateway, and rest beneath cooling bowers, But over your garden keep vigil, and refresh it with love's gentle showers." 632 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 Photograph submitted by Reva F.

LESSON = JE}DEPARTMENT Sheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 19—"Continuation of the Perean and Judean Ministry" up to and including "Parable of the Pharisee and Publican" Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 27, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, December 6, 1949 Objective: To continue the unfolding, by his matchless teaching, of the great gospel plan as taught by the Lord Jesus. In the House of One of the Chief Pharisees UDGED by the marvelous lessons he taught, the trip through Perea was one of the most important taken by the Savior. He did not hesitate to show his power, if thereby he might give to the people a much-needed lesson. While he was a guest at the home of a prominent Phanisee, a man afflicted with dropsy was healed by the Lord on the Sabbath day. He asked, "Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?" (Luke 14:3). No one ventured to answer. 'The answer was obvious. They had been taught to rescue an animal in trouble. Who would deny the blessing to a human being? Jesus did not hesitate to instruct in the matter of observing good manners. When guests at a dinner sought high places of honor, he stated an enduring moral law: "For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted" (Luke 14:11). This especially applies to workers in the Church and kingdom of God. A careful study should be made of the significant Parable of the Great Supper (Luke 14:16-24). It might be well to compare this with the parable relating to the marriage of the king's son (Matt. 22:2-14). Evidently, prior notice had been given in ample time to the chosen guests. It was to be a great event. Note carefully the excuses given by the invited prospective guests. It is so easy to find seemingly plausible excuses when we do not want to do a thing required of us or which we are invited to do. The man who had done the inviting was plainly angry because the guests invited first had not come. He commanded that the poor, the blind, and the maimed should be brought to the feast. This action indicated determination, but at the same time a disposition to do good and extend charity where needed. The lesson is plain. Israel, or the covenant race, was the specially invited guest. The children of Israel had been invited for a long while. Now they had been invited by the Messenger—Jehovah or the Christ, sent by the Father. They refused Page 633 634 the invitation and now the gospel would be carried to the Gentiles. Jesus declared of those who rejected his invitation, "For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper' (Luke 14:24). Counting the Cost The teaching of a profound lesson is recorded in Luke 14:25-35. During the journey we are considering, multitudes of people were attracted to the Lord wherever he appeared. When a certain scribe offered to become a disciple, Jesus explained the hardships and the self-denial that would follow, and the man's ardor soon cooled. 'The Master then applied a real test of sincerity. The genuine disciple must give up his wealth, his loved ones, and everything dear in life and follow the Savior. How many can and will do it now? Before one agrees to such an undertaking one should count well the cost. Salvation for "Publicans and Sinners'— Illustrative Parables Both Pharisees and Galileans had criticized Jesus because he had extended his ministry to the "publicans and sinners." He responded by giving them the well-known Parable of the Lost Sheep, somewhat modified from its former presentation to meet the needed lesson (Luke 15:2-7). In considering the application of this and the Parable of the Lost Coin, it should be pointed out that Jesus did not defend the evil ways of wicked people. He sought only to teach that we should rejoice when there is genuine repentance RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 on the part of the sinner. Jesus is the Good Shepherd. Of course he rejoices when a lost sheep is found. He rejoices also, however, over the good sheep who remain faithful within the fold. Let us next consider the Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15: 11-32). It has been so much misunderstood. The action on the part of the younger son in demanding his portion of the father's estate while the father was yet alive was an instance of deliberate and unfilial desertion. He went into a far country and spent his substance in "riotous living." Only when he suffered in abject poverty did he repent. A forgiving father was glad to welcome him back home. The father expressed his gratitude in acts of kindness. The son, counted as dead, was now alive. The older son, mistaking the father's joy on the return of the prodigal son, was angry and refused to enter the house. The father explained to the churlish older son: "Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine." No portion of the older son's pattrimony was taken from him. We must not extol the repentance of the prodigal son above the faithfulness on the part of the older son. Surely the sacred joy over the faithful here and hereafter exceeds the joy over the return of a sinful soul, even though the repentance on the latter's part is sincere and genuine. It was clearly a great lesson for the Pharisees. They must have taken its application unto themselves. They we
