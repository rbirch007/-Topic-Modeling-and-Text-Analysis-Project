nd the looping of the thread. Many of us remember long EDITORIAL afternoons and the time between sunset and twilight when we sat with our mothers on shaded porches and embroidered pillowslips and table linen and settled, in our way, the problems of womanhood, and charted ahead the long days that would lead far away from home and its protecting walls. Relief Society women, since the 599 meetings more than a century ago in Nauvoo, have been experts with needles and crochet hooks, and quilting frames and looms for rugs. They have sewed together and have woven friendships and attitudes of charity and compassion, giving generously from full hearts and busy hands to the loom of years. V. P. C. Votes to tue FIEp Annual General Reliof Society Conference THE annual general Relief Society conference will be held Wednesday and Thursday, September 28 and 29, 1949. On Thursday afternoon in the Tabernacle a meeting will be held to which the general membership of Relief Society and the public are invited. The attendance at the meetings Wednesday and Thursday mornings is limited to stake and mission officers. Buying Sexthooks for Relief Society oLessons FeROM inquiries which come to the general board it would seem that some Relief Society officers and class leaders are not acquainted with the recommended procedure for acquiring necessary textbooks for lessons. The educational counselor in both the stake and the ward should present to the president of the respective organizations a list of the textbooks which will be needed to teach the Relief Society lessons during the coming season. She should then be authorized to purchase these books with funds from the Relief Society general fund. The educational counselor should see that the name of the Relief Society organization is written in each book before giving it to the respective stake or ward class leader for her use. At the end of the course the educational counselor is responsible for collecting the books and placing them in the Relief Society library. Where a teacher wishes to purchase her own textbook in order to be able to mark it and keep it after the conclusion of the course, it is recommended that the Relief Society organization should also purchase the textbook: 1. In order that the book may become a part of the Relief Society library; 2. To be available for use by those given special assignments; 3. Because a change of teachers might be necessary during the course and at that time it might be impossible for the Relief Society organization to purchase a copy of the desired textbook. Educational counselors are urged to safeguard Relief Society libraries and to be alert to opportunities of adding to them gifts of Church and other worthwhile books. The Making and Use of Decorative Candles Mary Grant Judd Member, Relief Society General Board [This is the sixth in a series of short articles on table decorations, flower arrangements, and related subjects. In the coming months Sister Judd will present other suggestions suitable to particular seasons.—Ed.] Nite to June, September is the most popular month of the year for weddings. And weddings and candles just naturally go together. 'Though science has been able to give us far superior lighting from the standpoint of efficiency and brilliance, it has never been able to duplicate the soft glow of candlelight. For this reason, dinner tables, as well as background effeets for weddings (to mention only a few of many uses) turn to candles for just the nght touch. This month I would like to tell you of some interesting and beautiful decorations that can be made from new or partly burned candles. So, after the wedding dinner, don't throw the used candles away, but store them, to be brought out later, particularly at Christmas time. For individual candle favors that may serve, if desired, to support place cards, melt candles in a saucepan. Pour the melted wax into very small molds to the depth of about half an inch from the top. When the wax is cold and has hardened, place the mold in warm water until the candle can be released. In the meantime, slice a ready-made candle into one and a half-inch pieces and push one of them into the center of each mold, thus furnishing a wick. You may like to use contrasting Page 600 colors for the outside and the center. For the center of your table make the same sort of candles, half an inch only in depth. As you remove them from the mold, shape the edges to make them resemble an open flower like a wild rose. For the centerpiece use a low container with small pin frogs holding lilyshaped leaves. Float your wax flowers among the leaves. Just as your guests are to be seated, light the tapers at the individual places as well as those in the centerpiece. They will "oh" and "ah" at the lovely and unusual effect you have achieved. To make the lovely Christmas candles such as those illustrated, take tall cans in the forty-six ounce size, such as those used for grapefruit or tomato juice. Be sure to choose cans with no ndges. After cutting out the top of the can all the way around, make a circle of cardboard the size of the top. In the center of this cardboard make a small hole into which insert a r
