re following the letter of the law, but were unwilling to extend forgiveness to a truly repentant son. The lesson is not only for Copyright, 1929, by Eugene A. Perry From a painting by Soord THE LOST SHEEP Page 635 636 the Pharisees but for all people anytime, everywhere. There is and always will be joy for the lost soul who repents and comes back, but it does not supersede the joy for the souls who remain true and faithful. The Disciples Instructed by Parable The Parable of the Unrighteous Steward (Luke 16:1-8) was given primarily to and for the disciples. The steward in the story was the authorized agent of the employer. He was acting within the scope of his authority. Careful men do not fail to make provision for their future years. Some are surprised to learn, while reading the parable, that this man's apparent dishonesty was extolled. This is not the case. "His prudence and foresight were commended." Derision of the Pharisees Met; Another Illustrative Parable More than passing attention should be given to the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. Our Lord had given the hypocritical and scoffing Pharisees lessons on the right way of administering wealth. They thought, what does the poor Galilean know of such things? The Pharisees were crafty manipulators and yet were so successful in justifying their deeds before men as to appear honest. The Lord knew their hearts, and their practices were an abomination in his sight. He gave them an additional lesson by an unforgettable parable (Luke 16:19-31). These verses should be read. The rich man had fared sumptuously while on earth. He had been clothed in "purple and fine linen" while Lazarus, the beggar, "was laid at his gate, full of sores" and ate RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Dogs shared the lot of Lazarus and, when he died, he was probably buried in a pauper's grave. The nameless rich man also died. It is recorded that Lazarus went to Abraham's bosom signifying the paradise of God. The nch man died and went to a place of torment. As a Jew, he had doubtless often boasted that Abraham was his father. Now he was asking only for something to soothe his suffering, which he thought Lazarus, the onetime beggar, might bring. The conversation is enlightening. It was possible for the righteous to converse with the wicked. However, Abraham explained that it was impossible to grant the rich man's request because between the abode of the righteous Lazarus and that of the wicked sufferer "There is a great gulf fixed." Passage between the two abodes was forbidden. Even by parable, Jesus taught truly concerning the conditions in the hereafter. That righteous and unrighteous dwell apart during the interval between death and resurrection is clear. The parable teaches the continuation of individual existence after death, and the relation of cause to effect between the life one leads in mortality and the state awaiting him beyond. Unprofitable Servants Jesus also taught his disciples by parable when he could thereby impress the lesson more forcibly. The apostles, realizing the whole-souled service required of them, implored the Lord, saying, "Increase our faith." On one occasion the Lord repeated to them instructions previously given: "If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say LESSON DEPARTMENT unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you" (Luke 17:6). Their faith could best be determined by their obedience and service. The Parable of the Unprofitable Servants is given in Luke 17:7-10. It teaches that those who engage in the work of the Lord should give all their time and attention to him and even that would not repay him for all he had done. The apostles were not to complain at their tasks. The best they could do would only be their duty. Ten Lepers Healed Following the lesson mentioned in the preceding paragraph, Luke alone records the miracle of the healing of the ten lepers (Luke 17:11-19). He thereby also taught a great lesson on gratitude. Only one of the ten remembered to turn back and thank the Lord for his great blessing. That one was a Samaritan. Truly Jesus was preparing the apostles for the great lesson that the gospel was for all who were obedient. The Pharisee and the Publican The Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican was spoken "unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others" (Luke 18:9-14). It was not addressed to any particular 637 class. It may be used to condemn the Pharisaic spirit of self-complacency wherever found. The Pharisee was grateful that he was better than the other in his own estimation. However, it is interesting to note that he prayed "with himself." Such prayers do not avail much with God. The repentant publican humbly asked for forgiveness and for mercy. The Lord summed up the lesson when he said, "For every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted." Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Apply the Parable of the Great Supper to our day. Why do our missionaries sometimes request applicants for baptism to wait for a while before joining the Church? 2. What proof may be cited from the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus of the conditions hereafter? Are spirits separated in paradise? 3. Discuss the Parable of the Unprofitable Servants as it applies to us. Are we willing to give more than is required of us in the service of the Lord? 4. What was the sin of the Pharisee who went up to the temple to pray? Show the danger of Latter-day Saints partaking of this spirit.

HRIST came to prepare men's hearts so that they, as worthy subjects, would develop characteristics of the kingdom of God. A righteous kingdom cannot be established by unrighteous subjects. It follows then that the more closely individuals conform their lives to the teachings of Christ, the more neatly are they fitted to be his subjects. If they live according to his laws they will have peace in their hearts, for his is a peaceful kingdom. Love is the foundation of his teachings. Faith in God and service to fellow men, justice, tolerance, and forgiveness are characteristics of the true followers of the Master. "These things I have spoken unto you," he said, "that in me ye might have peace" (John 16:33). Not all wars are waged on fields of battle. 'Turmoil as tempestuous as that of actual war can sometimes rage in human hearts, but peace that passeth understanding can be had by those who have learned the way of peace. Never has there been a time when more people were confused and troubled and seeking for that great blessing, peace of mind. And yet how simple it would be for them to obtain it through righteous living. They are like the youthful characters in Maeterlinck's Blue Bird, who set out from their home in search of happiness only to find, after wandering far and near, that it had been within their reach in the familiar surroundings of their own home all the time. In his book Unto the Hills, in the section titled "Peace Within and Without," Elder Richard L. Evans has made some significant statements. He defines peace as belonging:... To an attitude of mind which leaves the windows of the soul open to all truth and the will to live in accordance with that truth.... Peace is more than mere absence of war. It is a mode of living, a state of well-being; a condition of self-control and social balance. He who has mastered self has found peace, even though there be no peace around him (Unto the Hills, page 123 ff.). What are the spoilers of inward peace? Elder Evans answers:.. Vanity and self-love, greed, unholy ambitions, crooked thinking.... The memory of things that should never have been done; the confusion that lurks in the human mind when the line of demarkation between truth and error is obscured; the consciousness of time's passing quickly by without our having freighted it with a full measure of achievement. In short those things which LESSON DEPARTMENT destroy our peace are the things which in all times and in all ages have been forbidden to men by the Lord God and the wisdom of experience.... The price of peace is obedience—obedience to all that the 639 ages have proved, obedience to all that the Lord has commanded, and obedience to all of those finer things that men already know in their inmost hearts (Ibid., page 124 ff.). ' Work ITleeting—Sewing Children's Clothing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 3—Play Clothes Jean Ridges Jennings For Tuesday, December 13, 1949 GINCE a very large part of children's lives is spent at play, clothes for play assume an important place in their wardrobes. Though they are quite expensive to buy, they can be made at little cost and are easy to do. Children are vigorous at play and often careless of their apparel. We do not want them to be unduly destructive or careless. But, on the other hand, we certainly do not want to dress them in such a manner that they are too conscious of their clothes and thus hampered in their play. Material for these garments must be appropriate to their purpose. They should be durable and very sturdy. And they should be made of fabrics that can easily be laundered. Play clothes should be quite comfortable for the wearer. They should allow ample room for activity and growth. If a child's clothes restrict him or are irritating, this. Will likely be reflected in his actions and disposition. He will show his irritation and dissatisfaction by becoming fretful or even naughty. 'Play clothes, almost more than any others, need to be made so that they are easy to put on and off. For younger children, choose the selfhelp style of garment. For older ones, be sure to allow plenty of placket room and long enough openings. Be sure that cuffs are not too tight and neck openings ample. Durable workmanship is necessary if the child's garment is to withstand severe strain, hard wear, and laundering. The stitching should be adjusted for the fabric and the thread should match the fabric in strength. Styles for play clothes are numerous and fabrics almost unlimited. Denims are sold in an endless variety of colors and designs. Some of © the heavier weights of spun rayon and cotton are ideal for this use. For the tiny tot, the coverall type of garment is easy and most satisfactory for boys and girls. As they grow older, sturdy dresses, or pedal pushers with gay shirts or jerseys, are nice for girls. Make gay flannel or cotton print shirts for boys to wear with heavy denim or cotton cord trousers. The felled seam is generally preferable as a finish for play clothes. It 640 is strong and durable as well as flat and neat looking. It serves equally well for trousers or slacks and shirts. Plackets should be ample in length and extra strong. Zipper closings are always good, as are continuous bound plackets. Either should be double stitched at the bottom. Buttons need a reinforcement behind them. Woven tape, patches of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 material, or stay buttons on the wrong side of the garment help prevent them from pulling out. Stitches of worked buttonholes should touch to make a firm edge and the thread should be sturdy. Commercial gripper fasteners make an ideal closing for play clothes. 'They are easy to apply and give excellent service. ~~ ol, stov@ieume— Wee Literature of England Elder Briant S. Jacobs Lesson 3—The Poet Shakespeare For Tuesday, December 20, 1949 VEN while our world continues to worship sensation, science, and the new model, Shakespeare endures. Despite the weaknesses of youth and the busied indifferences of maturity, there are those within each generation who arise to call his name one of the sweetest and strongest in the language. Increasingly each year his works are taught and read and performed, surely to feed a constant hunger for that which sustains. Now, as always since he wrote, Shakespeare is known and loved; it is Our present concern to ask why. In this short space it would be high presumption to attempt an evaluation of William Shakespeare, the supreme English author and dramatist, as revealed in his thirtyseven plays. Setting aside, then, a study of his plays as a course to be anticipated in future years, let us attempt to learn for ourselves who Shakespeare was and is, and why the literary and poetic values of his writings are unsurpassed. Although an immense accumulation of conjecture and opinion about Shakespeare's life now exists, actually we know precious little about him, and never has the little been more precious. In 1564 he was born in the country town of Stratford, located on the Avon River some eighty miles northwest of London. His parents were of the prosperous middle class, his father described alternately as a butcher, a wool merchant, and a dealer in gloves. At the age of eighteen Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, a farmer's daughter eight years older than he, who bore him three children. In his early twenties he went to London. Weare led to believe that he was employed in various minor jobs in one of the two London theaters, but by 1592, in his twentyeighth year, he was known both as an actor and as a writer of plays. Soon after this date he further established his popularity among the nobility by dedicating two poems, Venus and Adonis and the Rape of Lucrece to Henry Wriothesley, Ear] LESSON DEPARTMENT of Southampton, who seems to have been his intimate friend as well as his patron (a wealthy art-lover who financed artists and musicians who in turn dedicated their works to him). Most of his sonnets are believed to have been written during this period, from 1593 to 1596. He began writing two plays each year, and directed his own company of actors. At age thirty-three he purchased the largest house in Stratford; he also maintained a home in London where, save for periodical visits to Stratford, he spent most of his time. In 1611, at the height of his highly successful career, Shakespeare suddenly severed active connections with the theater and moved to Stratford. Here for the next five years he lived the life of a respected gentleman. He continued his friendship with various actors until he died at the age of fifty-two, presumably of the dreaded plague. About all these sketchy biographical details prove to us is that, so far as we can verify historically, his life was a simple and conventional one. He must have received no more education than the average town school offered, nor do we learn of any great mind which, during Shakespeare's most impressionable years, stimulated his genius. How, then, are we to account for the emergence of this man who, more than any other, molded into our language the strength, the flexibility, and the maturity which characterize modern English? From whence came this master dramatistactor-poet who, it has been said, exerted more influence on the growth of British traditions, even on the growth of the British Empire 641 itself, than any other person? Perhaps in the temper of the times, the most creative and vital in English history, lies at least part of our anSWeT. If Shakespeare was the flower of the Renaissance (rebirth), as he is generally acknowledged to be, the plant which produced such a bloom itself could have been no mean creation. Politically, economically, socially, and religiously, "the spacious times of Elizabeth" were epoch making. The strong, autocratic Tudors —Henry VII, Henry VIII, Elizabeth —defied any and all powers which seemed to endanger the unlimited expansion of everything English, and the emerging English middle classes but loved them the more for their courage and audacity, and for the wealth and intellectual freedom which resulted. Out of the confusion and uncertainty of the Hundred Years War with France (1337- 1453) and the English civil war, known as the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485), the Tudors built a vigorous, unified England. Following the discoveries of Columbus and others, England, through her fleet and her maritime skill, made herself the crossroads of the world. After the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, the military and commercial supremacy of England was assured, particularly so because of Queen Flizabeth's aggressive leadership. The resulting wave of nationalism gave further growth to the "pride of the English"; Shakespeare echoed it in his historical plays glorifying the English traditions. Henry V, for example, has been aptly described as an English national epic in dramatic form. 642 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 Inspirational 3-Part Music Women's Voices All in the April Evening—Diack._...15 Bless This House—Brahe _.. _._..15 The Bridge Builder—Dougall. 18 Come to Me—Beethoven 16 He Smiled on Me—O'Hara. _— 20 Hold Thou My Hand—Briggs..___ 15 How Beautiful Upon the Mountains —Harker 7 16 How Lovely Are the Messengers— Mendelssohn a2 I Shall Not Again Pass This Way— Effinger 18 If with All Your Hearts—Mendelssohn as The King of Glory—Parks _..___.. 20 The Lord's Prayer—Gates_ __.._.. 18 Write for information on music for all types of L.

PIRST OF ALL — RELIABILITY Paynes When Henry VIII directed the passage of the Acts of Supremacy in 1534, England was freed from the domination of the Pope, and Henry became head of the English Church. A year later the power of the printing press became more evident when Miles Coverdale printed the first complete English Bible, and since reading and writing rapidly became common, each Englishman soon learned to read his Bible for himself. Inevitably a new freedom characterized the realm of the intellect as well. In contrast to the other worldly Middle Ages, scholars concerned themselves with man and the immediate world about him. They sought to explain their environment as perceived by the senses. As a result of the use of the inductive scientific method, the sciences of chemistry, physics, and medicine began to emerge from the realms of superstition and quackery. Literature followed the classical Greek models, and borrowed profusely from Continental literary fashions, particularly those of Italy. Written by some Oxford scholars, but largely by gentlemen of the court and the middle classes, the literature became experimental, word conscious, and purely lyrical, so filled with natural melody and song that poetry might seem to be the common speech of Englishmen. The "spaciousness" of the age was surely not in physical London, which to us would in part be smelly, dirty, unsanitary, and cruel; instead, as Englishmen walked her narrow streets, it was their imaginations which soared without restraint. They saw visions and dreamed dreams of "brave new LESSON DEPARTMENT worlds," and, to describe what they saw and felt, they wrote for us the incredibly rich Elizabethan _literature, brimming with virility, naturalness, and originality. It is in probing this vein that we may enjoy the richest ore literature has produced: the writings of Shakespeare. However, we must remember that literature is never the sum total of whatever biographical details, sources, and influence were drawn upon in producing it. Literary excellence is not dependent upon the materials of a work of art, but upon what use is made of the materials. 'This observation is_particularly pertinent in studying Shakespeare, who borrowed the plots of almost all his plays. Wherein, then, does his originality lie? Like Chaucer, Shakespeare knew all classes, types, and characters of humanity. Neither condemning nor praising, neither concealing unflattering reality nor slighting the humorous or lovely, he looked into the heart of all humanity and wrote of what he saw with a piercing, lyrical freshness, and a deep-probing intellectual intensity which by their own stamp of excellence are peculiarly his. He has been halfway defined, almost too often, as a master in the use of words. As if one's literary excellence invariably increases in direct ratio to the size of one's vocabulary! We must remember Henry Ward bBeecher's thought, that "Words are pegs to hang ideas on." Not to deny that Shakespeare's word list is both large and pure: it is phenomenally so. But the beauty and the power of his style are produced, not by the isolated words he uses, but by his power of combining 643 SEARS ROEBUCK AND CO.

Business College 70 North Main Salt Lake City RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 words to force them to express precisely the idea or emotion he would convey to his audience. Shakespeare is a lyric poet, two terms equally difficult of definition. An attempt to define poetry is doomed to no more success than an attempt to define music, beauty, love; it is much easier exemplified than defined. Originally with the Greeks, lyric designated that which was to be sung with the lyre; the lyric is still to be identified by its melody and song-like quality, but it is a melody more of manner than of form. Any intense personal emotion—religion, love, grief—may be the material of a lyrical poem; all the emotions provide the subject matter of Shakespeare's lyrics. Pertinent here, both for manner and content, is Miranda's speech from The Tempest: O wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in't. If Shakespeare is the universal poet, we should find at once that his imagery attracts us; a reading of Shakespeare should clear our minds and souls of the trivial and the artificial, and from the truth and intensity of its content make us feel vibrantly aware and alive. Not only can Shakespeare perceive the truth, but he catches its essence and hands it to us for the taking, condensed in a nutshell. For example, "Tender inward of the hand" delicately catches the assence of an almost intangible, yet very real, sensation; "liberty plucks justice by the nose" tells far | more than it says. The list of such LESSON DEPARTMENT illustrations in Shakespeare is endless—as vast as Shakespeare himself. Because his phrases and epigrams are uniquely apt and therefore memorable, Shakespeare has lent many of them to our language, from "Brevity is the soul of wit" to "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark." Probably more of his phrases have been used as book titles than those of any other writer; throughout the centuries the music and intensity of his lines have found a sure audience. Consider, for example, the following, but a few of his best known: Use every man after his desert, And who should 'scape whipping (Hamlet). Thus conscience does make cowards of us all (Hamlet). How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is To have a thankless child (King Lear). Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow! You cataracts and hurricanes, spout Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks! You sulphurous and thought-executing fires Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder, Smite flat the thick rotundity 0' the world! Crack nature's molds, all germens spill at once That make ungrateful man!. Rumble thy bellyfull! Spit, fire! Spout, rain! (King Lear). Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it (Macbeth). If music be the food of love, play on (Twelfth Night). What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet (Romeo and Juliet). Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day 645 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops (Romeo and Juliet). The quality of mercy is not strained, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest; It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes (Merchant of Venice). How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night Becomes the touches of sweet harmony (Merchant of Venice). Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear; Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come (Julius Caesar). Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls: Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; "Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands; But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed (Othello). All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts (As You Like It). The music of Shakespeare's lyrical note is found pure and undefiled in the songs from the plays, which actually were sung. Most of his plays contain a few such songs, while The Tempest contains so many that it approaches opera. For a natural freshness and charm, for simple, memorable word music, his songs are 646 CONFERENCE VISITORS Delight in coming to our store to see the newest things in GIFTS An advanced showing of oustanding and distinctive PERSONALIZED Christmas farts You will find it a pleasure to browse among these displays of Cards of newest design and beauty EVERYTHING IN OFFICE FURNITURE Pembrokes 24 East Broadway Professional aah aol Stationery COMMERCIAL AND EDITION PRINTERS AND BOOK BINDERS PAPER RULING DESERET NEWS PRESS 29 Richards Street, Salt Lake City 1, Utah a RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—SEPTEMBER 1949 unrivalled.
