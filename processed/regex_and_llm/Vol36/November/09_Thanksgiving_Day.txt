THE LOST LENORE: The cottage in which Edgar Poe wrote "The Raven" has been torn down to make room for more modern buildings: but before it was demolished, even for years, since the death of Poe, relic hunters have visited the place carrying away anything portable; shingles, wallpaper, fire-place and window-lattice: so that really not much remained of the original home. THOUGHTS OF CHILDHOOD HOURS Thoughts. Of my childhood hours, Revel awhile for me, And pluck from fancy's bowers, Fair leaves from life's young tree Sweet buds of youth and beauty, Growing uncheck'd and free, In loving truth and duty Oh, bring them back to me! REASONS WHY: We do not intend to sit down in the corner and cry for sugar plums when there is so much needed work to be done, we do not believe in the fiction of the clinging vine, for although woman is more delicate in her organization than man, though she may sometimes carry her love of the refined and the beautiful to an extreme, still her heart is of oak, and when called to pass through scenes of trouble and distress, often exhibits a fortitude and carries burdens at which man would shrink, and when the trumpet sounds and the watchman on the tower cries aloud that the day is breaking, woman will be there with man and receive the reward of victory.— Phebe C.

We associate the word with reaping, the gathering of crops, and feasting on the good things which the earth yields abundantly. And yet the very first 'Thanksgiving Day was not a harvest festival. There had been no reaping and there was no feast. 'Thanks were given for all blessings, and thus it happened that the first Thanksgiving was in the late autumn of 1620, before any seeds had been planted in the earth roundabout Plymouth. It is recorded that the Pilgrim Fathers gave thanks when they first sighted the coast of New England. During their journeys of exploration and their trips inland to gather wood and search for food, they knelt and offered praise for the safe arrival of the Mayflower which had braved the stormy Atlantic and had arrived on the shores of the New World. There, on the edge of the wilderness, they were conscious of the great barrier of the ocean, conscious of the separation of distance. They felt wonderment and curiosity concerning that vastness which lay beyond the "stern and rockbound coast," and their strength came from a realization of their dependence upon divine guidance. Thoughts, clothed in the rhythm Page 744 of words, are long remembered and seem to grow more precious with the years. We are indebted to Govemor William Bradford for a lucid description of the end of a great sea journey, and the beginning of a new commonwealth. Being thus arrived in good harbor and brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed ye God of heaven, who had brought them over ye vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all ye perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on ye firm and stable earth, their proper elemente. The shore sloped up to the hills and the trees stood dark above the water. Winter had come to the New England coast and lay heavy on the hills. Ice had already locked the streams and snow covered the unknown reaches of the land. And for ye season it was winter. A desolate wilderness.... For summer being done all things stand with a weatherbeaten face, and ye whole country, full of woods and thickets, represented a wild and savage hiew. Such was the unwelcoming shore, and such the feelings of the Pilgrim Fathers on that day and in that year wherein the cornerstone of a nation was laid and the beginning of Thanksgiving came to America. For, as Governor Bradford so earnestly expresses it: Our forefathers came over this great ocean, and were ready to perish in the EDITORIAL wilderness; but they cried unto ye Lord, and he heard their voyce Let them therefore praise ye Lord because he Is good and his mercies endure forever, The Pilgrims had and they expressed their gratitude for a haven in the New World, a Place for the building of houses of worship, for the erecting of stately halls of government, for an Opportunity to build the material security and spiritual strength which are found a home, 745 necessary for the complete developfor us to Temember the words inscribed on monument, which, with ing years, become even More significant: "What our fathers with sO much difficulty secured, do not basely relinquish," V.

Abigail picked up the vase and sniffed the roses. "Penny is twenty. She's in love. You married younger." "You know it's not her age. But I won't have her marrying Mark Saunders. I won't let her. I won't!" She stood still, looking at her trembling hands. "You're letting yourself get upset over something you can't help." Joanna lifted her eyes. "You know what it's like to be poor. You've been through the things I've been through. You love Penny. Do you want her to have the life we knew?" Abigail put the roses back on the table. She faced Joanna. "Listen to me, Joanna. I've been poor and now, thanks to you, I'm a well-to-do woman, an' I can't see a speck of difference in my happiness. I was happy with Henry. I've been very happy with your children and you." She came to Joanna and hugged her briefly. "Never will I forget what a perky little thing you were. Rememberin' just this morning how you taught Primary when you were dead on your feet." OANNA kissed the soft, lined forehead. "I was grim and grave in those days took religion seriously." Abigail hesitated. "Did you know that it was on account of you that I went to Church...

That's why I've stayed here when times I was so mad I would have left you in a minute... Like now." "Abigail! You couldn't leave me. What have I done?" Abigail sniffed. "You're being perfectly pigheaded over Mark and Penny. Not taking into account how glad you ought to be that Penny's found a man of her own faith." '"There's all faiths." Abigail turned away. "I guess I should have known you would say that. Of course, there are nice boys of all faiths. But to think that Penny should be so blessed.... Did you know Mark's work is attracting attention back East?' Joanna shrugged. "Abigail, once and for all, I don't care what attention Mark's work gets. I won't have Penny marrying a hand-tomouth artist, and I'm not in the mood to support one myself." Abigail turned heavily toward the kitchen table. She picked up the vase again and carried it into the dining room. Over her shoulder, she asked in last defiance, "How are you going to stop her from marrying him, if she chooses?" Joanna swept off her smart fur hat and let the new fur coat slide from her shoulders. She sank wearily into a kitchen chair and stared out into the garden.

The town was hidden under a pall of smoke, but to the west the sun was setting in flaming splendor. She watched David's car come up the street. She smiled, seeing David's hand thrust out when he turned into the driveway, the cautious slowing down, so_ like David, careful, conscientious. No trace in him at all of his gay and reckless father. She went back into her room and changed into a housecoat and stretched wearily on the chaise longue. She heard David's step on the stair and then he knocked at her door. "Come in, David. I've _ been watching you come home." He opened the door and came in. He wore glasses now; they gave his face a scholarly look. But his blond hair was still as rumpled as when he was a little boy. He bent to kiss her and Joanna patted it into place. "What's new?" He pushed her over and sat beside her. "Mom, do you love me?" She grinned at him. "Even though you are a pill I love you still.' The old childhood rhyme brought the slow smile to his mouth. "How would you like it if I ran out on you for a couple of years?" "IT wouldn't." Joanna sat up. "You've just come back." "T've been called on a mission to Great Britain." OANNA sank back. She sighed in relief. "Oh, you frightened me for a moment. Of course, you can't go." "Why not?" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 Something in his voice she had never heard before, a withdrawal, as though she had become a stranger. She took his hand. "I need you, David." "What is it?" Quick alarm and concern in his eyes, and instantly, the old adoring love. "It's Penny " "T know. Has Mark been around to sue for her hand? He told me ge was trying to get up courage." Joanna leaned forward. "I won't have her marry Mark. I won't, I tell you, I won't." "But Mother, Mark's a swell guy, none better." "He's not good enough for Penny. After all the years I've worked and slaved to give her something better than I do. Do you think I'm going to throw her right back into poverty? No. No!' Suddenly she was crying, fiercely, bitterly, the hot tears burning her palms and running down her wnists. "Mother... Mother, please!"' He tried to take her hands away from her face. "T want you to stay home and run the business. I'll take Penny and Michael and Sally ona long long trip. You're the only one I can trust." "T see." He dropped her hands. She lifted her face to him. "You think I'm being cruel and unreasonable, but you don't know what Penny has always meant to me. You know she's not like other girls she's different.... There is so much of loveliness in her." "T know." David turned to face her. "Mother, don't you _ see? Don't you understand about Penny? JOANNA She doesn't need a lot of fancy gadgets around her. She doesn't feed on things like clothes, or jewels, or cars. She is nourished from deeper springs." He stared over Joanna's head. "Once, in March it was, I found her in th
