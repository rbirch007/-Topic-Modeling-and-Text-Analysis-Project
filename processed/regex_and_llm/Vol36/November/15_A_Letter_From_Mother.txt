ago. The table was set with a series of large bowls in the center of the table. Each person had his own spoon and they all ate from the common bowl. It was new and very interesting to watch, because they were gracious and courteous about it all. Each took his spoonful 'as he wanted, and when the bowl became empty it was soon filled with more of the same until the next course. They sat at the table almost all afternoon, eating and feasting. At about four in the afternoon a new ceremony took place at the home of the bride. The groom now took advantage of his rights, and asked the bride's parents if he might take her to his home to live with his family. The parents agreed and gave their blessing, but were very sad at the parting. The gitl took leave of her parents and, with her, she took her dowry, which consisted of a whole wagon load of feather beds and pillows. The wedding guests all accompanied them "home." On the way, they were stopped by a villager who had stretched a chain across the road. Many villagers were gathered at this spot to watch the fun and join in the merriment. This man stopped the wedding party, told the couple of their folly, and tried to bargain with them for the pillows. He was finally defeated in his attempts to make them unhappy, and so was satisfied when they paid him a few crowns in tax to go on. The couple entered the home of the groom, and the bride went immediately to his parents, and asked them if they would accept her into the family as one of their daughters. This was a very touching ceremony, and tears of joy were shed as she was welcomed and blessed by the head of the household. Thus being accepted, the feather beds were moved into the house by the maidPage 761 762 ens in the group. The feasting continued until midnight at which time the bride discarded her maiden's headdress, and donned one of a matron. The wedding cake was brought in at this time. It was a colorful one with a hole in the middle. This was passed around and all present put money into the hollow cake, and each said something like this: "I bequeath you this money that you may remember to be a good and careful mother to your children." Others gave money for the cradle, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 others gave some to help buy a first animal for their flocks and so on. The celebration and feasting lasted for three days and, all the while, the villagers helped with the cooking, with the chores in the fields, and with the cattle and flocks so that no time was lost by those celebrating. It was a real example of brotherhood, love, and cooperation. The whole world could gain a lesson by observing this good, simple, God-fearing people who love their neighbors as themselves. > A Letter from Mother M* Dear Children: How are you, darlings?

I will be with And this year I shall visit my dear brothers and sisters, and close the day, perhaps, by reading more in the Doctrine and Covenants. (I have acquired the habit of closing each day by reading a few verses from Church books.) The other evening, I turned to the 58th section of the Doctrine and Covenants and happened upon the words: "For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant." I read on until I fairly squirmed—you know how I prefer listening from the back row. After I turned out the lights, I thought of what I had read. I concluded that listening was all right in its place, but if the Lord expected us to act on our own initiative, seeking ways to help in his cause, I ought to see what I could do. I decided to offer to do typing or other detail office work for the bishopric, which would free them for more important duties. I felt ashamed that I had not seen the need before. Anyway, it seems to me that anything we do to help in the Lord's work really helps us. So, darlings, why not read that section and see if it affects you similarly? Suddenly it is quite late, and I must close. Dearest love to my grandchildren— and grand children. Mother CLARA HORNE PARK (Note: Mrs. Park, who lives in Salt Lake City, is the daughter of Richard S.

IER DEPARTMENT a c" Sheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 21—"On to Jerusalem" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 29, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, February 7, 1950 Objective: To show how steadfastly Jesus continued to minister unto people on his road to foreknown Calvary and the cross. Jesus Again Foretells His Death and Resurrection ACH of the three synoptic writers gives a fairly detailed description of the events during the last journey to Jerusalem. The apostles noticed how sad and deeply affected Jesus was and fell behind him in amazement. They seemed not to understand his plain affirmation that he would be delivered to the Gentiles who "shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again" (Luke 18:33). It was all inconsistent to them. They knew he was the Christ—the Lord Omnipotent— and could not realize he would be brought into subjection and slain. They particularly could not understand his prediction that in three days he would be resurrected. The Question of Precedence Again During this solemn and never-tobe-forgotten trip the human side of some of the twelve asserted itself. Jesus had diligently labored to teach them that service was the true measure of greatness, and yet two of them—James and John—the sons of Zebedee—made the request that they be given seats of eminence. This request was to be realized when Jesus came into possession of his kingdom. Matthew records that the request first came from their mother, who was probably the Savior's aunt. (See note 1, end of chapter 29 of the text.) Jesus gave them an impressive lesson and told them plainly that the granting of such a request was the prerogative of his Father (Mark 10:35-45). They needed, as we all do, to learn this lesson: '""For even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister" (Matt. 20:28). Sight Restored to the Blind Near Jericho As Jesus was leaving Jericho to walk the last fifteen miles of his journey, a blind man asking for alms heard the tramp of the great multitude which was following, and was told "that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by." 'The blind beggar cried: "Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me." 'The title "Son of David" had peculiar significance. It was the salutation given to Joseph Page 769 770 by the angel at the time the birth of Jesus was announced to that good man. It meant of royal lineage (Matt. 1:20). It proves that the blind man knew of Jesus and had faith in him. Some tried to silence the man but he called the louder. Jesus directed that the man be brought to him. After a brief conversation the Lord said unto him: "Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee." Wondrous words of power and faith! The man was healed. With a heart full of gratitude he glorified God in prayers of thanksgiving (Luke 18:35-43). Zaccheus, the Chief Among the Publicans At Jericho another event occurred, which is worthy of note. The Roman government maintained at this city a staff of collectors of customs, commonly called "publicans." Chief of these was a Jew named Zaccheus. He had "grown rich" by collecting customs and was unpopular, as were all publicans. He had already been impressed by the teachings of the noted Galilean and had a great desire to see him. Zaccheus was a small man and could not ordinarily see over the heads of others. So when he knew that Jesus was coming, he ran ahead of the other people and climbed a tree by the side of the road that he might have a better view. When Jesus reached the place, he spoke to the man in the tree: "Zaccheus, make haste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house." However, the multitude criticized Jesus, saying that he "was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner." Zaccheus did not deny the charge but, after RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 he was converted, offered to make restitution if it was found that he owed any man. He vowed to give "half of his goods" to the poor and to restore fourfold anything he had taken wrongfully. Jesus accepted the man's repentance. Another wayward son had returned. 'The Lord had come to save sinners; to bring joy to the repentant soul (Luke 19:1-10). Unto Every One That Hath Shall Be Given As Jesus neared Jerusalem, he gave to his followers, who were expecting him to proclaim his royal authority, the Parable of the Pounds. (Read Luke 19:11-27.) The story portrayed a recent incident in Jewish history. (See note 3 at end of chapter 29 of the text.) The Lord used the incident as a basis on which to give the account of the three servants to whom had been entrusted the use of a varying number of pounds and how each had used the money. It is quite apparent that Jesus was the nobleman, invested with the authority of kingship. He is to return and demand an accounting from his trusted servants. When he does return he will also punish the citizens who rebelled against him. In the House of Simon the Leper The Savior approached Jerusalem a few days before the killing of the lambs which were eaten at the time of the Passover. 'This was the great annual feast of the Jews. It commemorated the sparing of the Hebrews in Egypt when God smote the first-born of the Egyptians (Ex. 1:1-22). That year the festival LESSON DEPARTMENT probably began on Thursday. Jesus reached Bethany near Jerusalem on the end of the Jewish Sabbath. Jesus knew that it was his last Sabbath on earth and he chose to spend it with those he loved. Out of reverence, the writers do not tell of the happenings of that day. It was probably in the evening after the Sabbath had passed that a supper was given for Jesus and the twelve at the home of Simon the leper. Undoubtedly this man had been cured. Some wniters assume that the house was the family home of Lazarus and Martha and Mary. Simon may have been: their father, but of that there is no proof. Martha evidently had charge of the supper and Mary and Lazarus were there. In fact, Lazarus had been marked for death by the chief A Perry Picture 77 priests because of the interest following his restoration to life. Mary had brought to the gathering a sealed flask containing a pound of costly spikenard ointment. It was very fragrant and is said to have had a value of about forty-five dollars. When Mary had used this precious ointment to anoint the head and feet of the Lord, Judas Iscariot, treasurer of the twelve, and others, protested against such extravagance. Judas was dishonest and hypocritical and asked why the ointment was not sold and the money given to the poor. By way of solemn instructions Jesus said: For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel From a Painting by Plockhorst CHRIST'S ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM 772 shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her (Matt. 26:11-13). How true were these words! Christ's Triumphal Entry Into Jerusalem The next day after the eventful supper, Jesus told two of his disciples to go to a certain place and they would find an ass tied and with her a colt on which no man had ridden. The disciples found the animals as directed and when they had brought the colt, and spread their coats on his back, Jesus was lifted on to the young animal. The Master rode toward Jerusalem. When the group arrived the city was thronged, although it was four days before the great festival. The common people were interested in every movement of the Savior and there was gteat rejoicing when he appeared on the outskirts of the city. The people threw palm leaves and flowers before him and even spread their garments on the streets before him. 'Truly they were carpeting the way for a King. They shouted, among other glad calls: "Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest" (Matt. 21:9). Amid all the rejoicing Jesus was sad. When he saw Jerusalem and the temple of the Lord, he wept and prophesied of the destruction of both. When he rode into the capital, the people were thrilled. The uninformed cried, "Who is this?" And the multitude shouted "This is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee" (Matt. 21:10-11). The Pharisees and chief priests RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 resented bitterly the honor being shown the Lord. "The purpose of Christ in thus yielding Himself for the day to the desires of the people and accepting their homage with kingly grace may not be fully comprehended by us of finite mind." The Roman officials seemed to treat it with indulgent unconcern. When Jesus dismounted and entered the temple enclosure the people continued to shout his praises. Truly, the Prince of Peace had entered the city and temple as befitted a king of Israel. His coming fulfilled prophecy (Zech. 9:9). Certain Greeks Visit Christ During practically all of the Savior's ministry he worked among the Jews. However, people of many nations came to Jerusalem at the time of the annual Passover. Some of these, though not of Jewish descent, had been converted to Judaism. Among these people were certain Greeks who desired to talk with Jesus. They did not think it proper to approach the Master directly, so went first to Philip, one of the apostles. Philip consulted with Andrew, and the two informed Jesus that the foreign visitors sought an interview with him. Jesus bore testimony to these men that the hour of his death was near. They were surprised at his words, and he explained that it was necessary for him to make this sacrifice. (See John 12:20-28.) Those who really love the Lord will give their lives, if necessary, for his sake. Let us at least live for him. The Voice From Heaven The sinful condition of the world and the terrible experiences through LESSON DEPARTMENT which he was about to pass, weighed heavily upon the Lord's soul. In anguish he groaned: "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?" A mighty soul arose to meet an issue of transcendent importance. He prayed: "Father, glorify thy name." To that prayer came an answer: "Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again." (Read John 12:27-36 and John 14:27-31.) "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you" (John 14:27). " And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6).

What great _ lesson can we learn from his answer to them? 2. Relate the event of the healing of the blind at Jericho. Show that the blind beggar really appreciated the blessing. 3.

Et Visiting Seacher Tlessages—Our Savior Speaks Lesson 5—"Is Not the Life More Than Meat, and the Body Than Raiment?" (Matt. 6:25) Mary Grant Judd For Tuesday, February 7, 1950 Objective: To emphasize that there is a larger life than that of the body, namely that of the spirit. HEN, in the course of the Sermon on the Mount, Christ presented the question "Is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment?" (Matt 6:25) to his listeners, he was, undoubtedly, not objecting to man's striving for the requirements necessary to physical well-being. The decree to Adam that "in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread' has come down through the ages. It was valid in the time of our Savior; it holds good today. A cardinal principle of the present Church Welfare Plan confirms the dignity of work and points out that individuals, insofar as possible, should labor for their own 774 sustenance. For, as the proverb says: "in all labor there is profit" (Prov. 14:23). When Christ asked "Is not the life more than meat?" he was pointing out that, while it is necessary to provide for our daily reeds, we must not stop there, but go on from the life of the body to the larger life of the spirit. How many people do you know who are content to spend their time "getting and spending," as the poet Wordsworth termed it, with little thought for those larger values of life which are so much more important than mere living from day to day? When he declared the body more than raiment, Christ was warning against the identification of self with material things. How easy it is to feel superior because we have acquired worldly wealth. When we don fine wearing apparel, we move RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 with greater confidence and ease among our friends. As we speed down the street in a new car is our egotism heightened to note the admiring glances of our neighbors? When one builds a large home and furnishes it beautifully, is this, partly at least, to impress those who view it? Yet, in the final analysis, how unimportant these material things are. For, as we well understand, when we leave this life, we can take with us only the sum total of the good we have accomplished and the knowledge we have acquired. And so it is right and proper that Jesus should tell us to put greater emphasis on spiritual, rather than on material values. "Seek ye first," he says, "the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these [physical things] shall be added unto you" (Matt. 6:33). <-> Work IT leeting—Sewing Children's Clothing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 5—Girls' Clothing Jean Ridges Jennings For Tuesday, February 14, 1950 T'S fun to make clothes for girls. There are so many lovely materials and clever styles from which to choose. Here's a place where you can exercise your hidden talents and ambitions as a designer by using onginality and individuality. Here, too, is much opportunity for fine handwork and dainty trimmings. In the opening lesson we talked of choosing becoming and appropriate styles and materials. 'This, of course, is most important. For small tots it is also vital that clothes be launderable. There are so many attractive and dressy materials available from which to make little party dresses that can be freshened as often as need be by washing, that it seems unwise to make clothes that LESSON DEPARTMENT can't be laundered for children. Dainty dotted Swiss, organdie, or the fine silky cottons in pastel shades can be made into dainty frocks that are as lovely as any taffetas or other silks and have the advantage of being tubbable. Thus they can be worn oftener and with less worry and expense for upkeep. While children's clothes should be made roomy enough to allow free movement, they should fit Properly when new. If too much room is allowed for growth, they may be old and shabby before the child grows into them. When making girls' dresses, have them fit well when made, allowing a generous hem to be let down as the child gtows taller. A wide hem looks well and gives body to the skirt and is one Place where a dress can be readily adjusted for size. Make dresses wel] and finish them neatly.

Jacobs Lesson 5—Sir Francis Bacon For Tuesday, February 21, 1950 A we have already pointed out in our discussions of Shakespeare and the King James Bible, the age of Flizabeth has never been surpassed, neither in the fresh vigor which it stamped upon every phase of English life, mor in the correspondingly rich literature which inevitably the Flizabethans wrote to record the lavish flowering of the spirit which was theirs. After having been enslaved throughout Europe during the dark centuries of supervised ignorance and the smothering dogmas of church and state, men's wills and emotions and intellects suddenly awakened and arose as One. Magnificently, these pent-up powers defied the traditional absolutes of politics and religion to continue to break their spits which, for ages, had been withered, crooked, and starved. Magnificently, these sons of the Renaissance, Or Te awakening, gave to their fellows throughout all time the great vision of men exercising wills that are free, emotions that are pure and honest, and intellects determined to give man dominion over the natural world which he had always misunderstood and hence always feared. And of those who dreamed most nobly of man's raising himself to his destined realm of light by reaching down and lifting himself by his own intellectual bootstraps, Jet the name of Francis Bacon be first. Son of the lord keeper of the great seal of Queen Elizabeth, Bacon was reared amid court influences. After studying at Cambridge, he first served his government at age fifteen 'n the English embassy in France. Upon completing three years service he returned home intensely ampitious for political advancement. Unable to impress Queen Elizabeth favorably, he studied law at Gray's Inn and soon thereafter became 4 member of Parliament and advisor to the Queen. When James I be came King, Bacon was knighted. Almost at once it became apparent that the new monarch, weak-willed and amateur scholar that he was, found in Bacon's flattery and intellectual genius much to be rewarded. Bacon was elevated to AttorneyGeneral, and finally became Chancellor of England; he was also made Baron Verulam and Viscount of St. Albans. Yet, despite this whirlwind rise to political and social eminence, he felt that his true carect had scarcely begun. And so it had, for always he regarded his political achievements merely as useful tools to assist him in realizing his heart's desire: the writing and publication of a systematic definition and atrangement of all human knowledge and truth. This was a project unrivalled in its ambition and magnitude by any man since Aristotle (384-322 B. C.). In 1586, at the age of twenty-five, LESSON DEPARTMENT Bacon first defined this great idea and dedicated his life to its achievement. 'Ten years later he pointed out to his kinsman, Lord Burleigh, that his civil goals were but moderate when compared to his contemplative goals, since in the realm of the intellect he had "taken all knowledge" to be his province. Seven years later, in 1603, he wrote that he had found himself "fitted for nothing so well as for the study of Truth." It was Bacon's resulting philosophical writings which, in Macaulay's phrase, "moved the intellects which moved the world." All his important philosophical works were but segments of his Magna Instauratio, or great renewal of scientific and intellectual knowledge. It was in these writings, particularly his Advancement of Learning and Novum Organum, or new principles, that Bacon "announced that Europe had come of age." Here, for the first time, in the works of this first great English philosopher, we have expressed the tone and principles of the same modern science which has done so much to conquer the natural world in which we live. Here, not because of any scientific techniques or discoveries, but because of his revolutionary ideas as to what science should be and how it should be used, we read the words which made Bacon the father of modern science. Most of all Bacon believed in human reason. Disregarding tradition, he hoped to shatter the influence of the past and to aid man in conquering the realm of nature by using his own intellect. Significant is one of his favorite sayings, 777 "Knowledge is power." A new and vital part of his credo was that knowledge should not be sought merely to entertain the speculative medieval scholar; instead scientists should seek out the secrets of nature in order that new discoveries might be used at once to control and overpower nature. Let us learn the laws of nature, and we shall be her masters, as we are now, in ignorance, her thralls; science is the road to Utopia. (Advancement of Learning, iv, 2) But before science could be trusted so completely, Bacon had to tredefine the methods science should use in the search for truth. In place of the deductive logic of Aristotle, which had entirely dominated the scholarship of the Middle Ages, Bacon preached fervently that the method of science must be inductive. Instead of reasoning from one or two facts or premises to prove a third unknown, Bacon, as does the modern scientist, believed that one can arrive at a general truth only after a mass of general fact has been assembled and most carefully examined. With the method of science thus defined, Bacon was ready to point out another reason why the sciences had made but little progress. It is not possible to run a course aright when the goal itself has not been rightly placed. Now the true and lawful goal of the sciences is none other than this: that human life be endowed with new discoveries and powers. (Novum Organum, I, Ixxxi) The supreme conviction of Bacon's life was that by using reason 778 and the scientific method, man js best capable of subduing the world about him. Men are not animals erect, but immortal gods. The Creator has given us souls equal to all the world, and yet satiable not even with a world... - Everything is possible to man. Time ls young; give us some little centuries, and we shall control and remake all things. Bacon hoped first to "seat the sciences each in its proper place" (Advancement of Learning, iv, 2), next to develop the inductive scien. Tific method for defining the forces of nature, and finally to evaluate all nature by using such a procedure. In the prophetic New Atlantis, fictional treatment of his Utopia which was left unfinished at his death, Bacon presented his ideal method for achieving his goals: he visualized a society of learned scholars called Solomon's House, or the College of the Six Days' Work, who cach twelve years were to be sent throughout the world by their wise king to "maintain a trade, not for gold, silver, or jewels... But only for God's first creature, which was light: to have light, I say, of the growth of all parts of the world." (See Text, pp. 562-3, line 4o ff.) That he spoke for the intellectual leaders of England was proved in 1662 when, thirty-five years after the New Atlantis was published, the Royal Society was founded. This Was a group of the best scientists umited in the common cause of Searching out the truths of natural history in precisely the same manner as Bacon's scholars in Solomon's House would have done. Surely there could be no greater tribute to the intellectual zeal and scientific RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 pioneering which then, as now, characterized Bacon _ before the world. It is unfortunately true that some of our great men understood wisdom with their heads but not with their hearts and wills, Of this truth Sir Francis Bacon is the traditional example. "They that take the sword shall perish with the sword" (Matthew 26:52). Although Bacon professed membership in the Church of England, was interested in church reform, and wrote several] beautiful prayers for his Own use, pumarily he loved the intellect alone. Bacon served learning and the learned; but his accusation of his friend Essex in order to obtain favor with Queen Elizabeth; his confession of having accepted bribes when in high office without the ability to express remorse or sense of guilt for the tragedy of his sin; his selfrighteousness; and_ his continued ability to sacrifice personal connections and, in part, his own integrity whenever he felt such action would please the sovereign and his own ambition—all seem to give evidence that he failed to honor the emotional and spiritual aspects of himself and his fellow men, a failure which finally betrayed Bacon himself. | In 1621, after confessing his guilt In accepting bribes, Bacon was deprived of the Great Seal, fined forty thousand pounds, relieved of al] public office, and sentenced to the Tower of London, from which he was released by the King after four days. During the last five years of his life he lived in retirement, writing the major portion of his enduring contributions to science and LESSON DEPARTMENT Philosophy, More than any other worked over hi Intellectya] Tesourc man, he Opened the door 'to oy €s, never discarding he g d, never Modern scientific orld; his Essa Permitting the hazy, 2Y words to will a Ways represent English Prose stan a result Essays are at its be Yet, we might 48T€e famous for their brillian ©; rarely has that Alexander Pope was Neither pros said so much IN so little Space entirely Nght nor ntirely wrong Here Is the co densed Intellect of When he €scribed Sir Francis Ba.

'The truths which they tell about things as they are, often wittily expressed in a condensed, near-staccato style, blend together in these essays to become reading which will be fresh and rewarding as long as men are human. As we read from Novum Organum (Text, pp. 560-561) of the four idols which beset the human mind, we realize that Bacon knows people and their foolish weaknesses. 'The following epigram, taken from "Of Sedition and Troubles" (not in our text) also reveals his wit and wisdom, and knowledge of things as they are: Money is like muck, not good unless it be spread. The twelve essays in our text abound in such memorable lines. Some of the best known are: Certainly virtue is like precious odors, most fragrant when they are incensed or crushed: for prosperity doth best discover vice; but adversity doth best discover virtue. ("Of Adversity'' ) Choose the best; habit will make it pleasant and easy. ("Of Parents and Children' ) He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief. ("Of Marriage and Single Life'') It is a strange desire, to seek power and to love liberty; or to seek power over others and to lose power over a man's self. ("Of Great Place" ) Certainly, men in great fortunes are strangers to themselves, and while they RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 are in the puzzle of business they have no time to tend their health, either of body or mind. ("Of Great Place') For good thoughts (though God accept them) yet towards men are little better than good dreams, except they be put in act. ("Of Great Place") After a time, set before thee thine own example; and examine thyself strictly, whether thou didst not best at first. ("Of Great Place') And certainly it is the nature of extreme self-lovers, as they will set an house on fire, and it were but to roast their eggs. ("Of Wisdom for a Man's Self') Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested. ("Of Study'') Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. ("Of Studies"') Once our minds arise from their leisurely, everyday meanderings to meet these Essays on their own high level, once we give Ourselves to them with no restraint and no distraction, we find in them a compelling intensity which ever leads us on. Further, here is that undefinable, undeniable lofty tone which is the autograph of great literature. NOTE TO TEACHERS: While you will want to share the above lines with your group, you should also read thoroughly with them one or two of the essays which appeal most to you. If you haven't time to read them all, "Of Truth," "Of Studies," "Of Great Place," and "Of Adversity," might, in this order, prove: most rewarding. However, you cannot go wrong if you discuss in detail that essay which is most nearly yours. Questions 1. What was the great idea in Bacon's life? 2.

Homer Durham For Tuesday, F ebruary 28, 1950 Objective: To uphold freedom. Public Administration ig is important to have a good government, that is, one which conforms, as far as possible, to the fundamental _ principles previously discussed. Then, government becomes a fit instrument in securing "the good and safety of society." However, day by day, governments are administering thousands of details affecting the lives of millions of people. The enforcement of the law, the administration of governmental policy, is generally called "public administration." The problems of public administration are among the most important of any modern society. The problem of regulating traffic, of Inspecting and maintaining milk at a pure standard, the administration of schools, the building of highways, the protection of life and property—these are only a few of the many tasks undertaken by public administration. Point out the need for electing government officials who will Government Personnel There are many fundamental _ problems in public administration apart from the organization of government itself. These problems concern largely the matter of personnel. Officers must be recruited. Once in office they have the great responsibility of deciding what the law means, when to enforce it, and upon whom to enforce it, Verse three affords an insight into the basic principles which should govern these important problems: We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. This recognizes the necessity and the importance of civil officers and magistrates. During World War II, the United States Government, alone, employed over 3,000,000 civil 782 servants, that is, civil officers exclusive of elected, military, naval, legislative, or judicial officers. 'This does not include the forty-eight states, nor their counties and cities. What should be the method of their administration? The controlling principle is that "such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld." Meaning of "Equity and Justice" What is equity? What is justice? These are often difficult questions in our time. It would be profitable to discuss in every class the question as to what is justice for the working man, for the business leaders, for the members of a minority religious sect, for the members of a dominant religious sect, for alien races, for the various types of people who occupy a place in our civil society. The answers to these questions have obsessed mankind for generations. Is it possible to cut through this mass of speculation and arrive at some foundation principles as guides to equity and justice? The Declaration would suggest that equity and justice would begin with a system of administration which would recognize the fundamental conditions of peace previously discussed. The free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life, at least, are fundamental. Qualifications for Public Officers Who should be selected for public officers? 'The suggestion made in verse three is that those who will RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people, if a republic, or the will of a sovereign. It would be very difficult, of course, for the people of the United States, _ for example, to elect the three million civil servants who served the United States Government from 1942-1945. Then, in addition, to elect the additional millions who work for the forty-eight states, the three thousand and fifty-odd counties, the hundred and_ thirty-two thousand cities and towns, and the other units of government which constitute the American governmental system! However, it is possible to seek and uphold persons who "will administer the law in equity and justice" by means of the civil service examinations and other devices used in American and other governments. Popular election, of course, is desirable for all elected representatives and those who serve in top executive positions. In other circumstances, and in filling the lesser positions, regulations must, of course, be followed. But back of all law, including civil service law, is public opinion. If the public is apathetic, it is impossible to secure officers who will administer the law in equity and justice. How well informed is your class on the method of safeguarding the purity of the water supply, the milk supply, the meat supply, in your community? What officers are administering these laws? Is it being done with equity and justice? Do you know their names? Are they qualified to do their work?

Referred to this this reference, ethics become the 784 mere opinions of men, Americans or others, with resort to force as the threatening reference point. When the State intervenes in the economic order, this value must be recognized. If the conscience, the religious conscience, of man, is free, then there will always be room for the eventual right of control of property and the protection of life. If human law is prevented from prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of man, "nor dictate forms for public or private devotion" then there is a sphere of freedom in which men may live their lives. Need for People to Support Freedom Constitutions are the great preventive influence, but constitutions are valueless without support from the people and the political powers that be. True, the civil magistrate should restrain crime "but never control conscience"; should punish guilt but never suppress the freedom of the soul. This requires popular support. If there is freedom of religious conscience and freedom of the soul, there will probably be freedom for two or more political parties. If there is freedom for two or more political parties, there is freedom in the choice of public officers to enforce the law. If there is freedom to choose these officers, there is also freedom for the people to exercise their right and seek for men in public life who will administer the law in equity and justice. Without this freedom, there will be no essential freedom—and no peace. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 Belief in God Necessary for Good Government In conclusion, it can be stated, that if you destroy belief in God, you destroy belief in the necessity of religious liberty. Decline in belief in God is one of the great forces aiding and abetting Communism. Religious and _ political liberty without belief in God soon become meaningless, because they depend upon mere human toleration, man looking to man. Unless man looks to man as a child of God and then looks beyond and outside of himself for something greater, he may become a menace, a materialistic menace to society. Human toleration without belief in God ls subject to political pleasure, as witness the dictatorships. In short, if you destroy God you destroy the possibility of political ethics having any vitality in government. In its stead, force, and force alone, remains. Force is the tool of the devil. Of such, the Declaration warns, and men should beware. Questions for Discussion and Lesson Helps Special Project: Have someone look up and report the number of offices becoming vacant which will appear on your local ballot at the next general election, describing briefly, the functions of each office. 1. Although all people have the rnght to their own opinions in such matters, who is it that actually (in the bulk of cases) decides what the law means, when to enforce it, and whom to enforce it upon? 2. Have someone look up "equity" in a standard dictionary. Having done this, ask the class to discuss the meaning of "equity" as contained in section 134, verse 3. LESSON DEPARTMENT 3. What is justice? Discuss the principle as suggested in the lesson. 4. How do you suppose the ordinary man's view of justice is formed? Compare this with the concept of the class as to how God, our Father, probably determines and applies justice. 5. What is the relation between public opinion and the administration of "justice?" 785 6. Why is belief in God 'essential to good government? 7. When the butcher sells you a roast and leans a heavy thumb on the scale or includes a large piece of bone at 97c a pound, is he visualizing you as a "child of God" or Mrs. John Customer "from down the street?" 8. Again, is belief in God essential to good government, to justice and equity?
