think it is going to die. What can I do?" The cow was startled and nearly upset the milk bucket. Tom patiently moved his stool and started milking again. "Let it die, I guess. It probably will anyway," he said. "But if you want to monkey with it, Joe says castor oil sometimes helps. Marty has some if you want to try it." I was on my way before he had stopped speaking. Joe was watering the lucern field which lay between our house and theirs but, fast as | was going, I took the ditches which crossed the path in my stride and scarcely saw them. Marty was cooking breakfast, She left the stove and found the castor oil among the many bottles in her medicine cabinet. She held the bottle up to the light and shook it. "Yes, there is plenty here. You won't need more than a couple of teaspoonfuls. Don't you want a hot biscuit?" "Oh, no, thanks, I'm in a hurry. Thanks a lot." And I was gone again as fast as I could run. I jumped the ditches as I ran just as I had done on the way over, but I must have stepped too close to the edge of one. Down JI went, my foot sinking deep in the mud and 756 throwing me forward with a splash. I caught myself with one hand and held the castor oil high with the other. But the more I tried to pull my feet out of the mud the farther in I sank. The mud itself just seemed to be pulling me deeper and deeper. "Tom," I called, "Tom!" He was just coming to the house with the milk. He put the buckets carefully on the back porch and walked leisurely around to the front and started putting on his big boots. There was a big grin on his face. Maybe I did look funny, but it was no joke. 'The more I floundered the deeper in I went. I would probably be clear to China before he got there. ""I'om, come and help! Can't RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 you see I am sinking deeper and deeper!" "What did I tell you?" he said as he came toward me in his big boots. "Just like quicksand this soil when it's wet and just like a brick when it's dry. Maybe you'll believe what I said about this ground now." He pulled me out and carried me the rest of the way home. Me with the bottle of castor oil held high and mud clear to my waist. "Still want to raise flowers?" he teased as he set me safely on the porch. Of course I wanted to raise flowers, what did that have to do with falling in the mud! November Day Beatrice K. Ekman A cold day, a gray day, Wind and rain and sleet; Sullen clouds that do not break, Shroud-mist on the wet, paved street. The rain drips from the shingle eaves In dreary monotone; With gusty force against the pane, A leafless branch is blown. The sodden leaves cling to the grass, Bare trees loom stark above... I kindle fire in my heart... In memory of my love. —_- Pioneer Recipe Anna Prince Redd I remember a very old and a very respected, early pioneer of Panguitch, Utah. She lived alone in a log-room home on the edge of town. Every day at exactly four P. M. A townswoman, taking her turn, would arrive (or her child would) at the cabin with a hot dinner for 'Aunt Mariar," as she was fondly called. One day when it was my mother's turn, she fixed the tray and sent me to deliver it. "Tell Aunt Mariar,'"' Mother said, "that I didn't have any eggs to make a cake today, but I'll make one tomorrow and send her two pieces. And be sure to tell her before you uncover the tray, or she'll be offended and won't eat any dinner. She loves cake."' Standing just beyond ''Aunt Mariar's" exactly. Reaching hands, I delivered the message, Still living in her days of pioneer hardship, she leaned forward and cried out in a high-pitched voice: "Land sakes, child, you don't need eggs to make a cakel Just tell your Ma to add a little more soda to give it that yellow cast."
