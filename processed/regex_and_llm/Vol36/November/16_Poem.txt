Apostles. President Lund vigorously fulfilled his three-fold assignment—counselor in the First Presidency, temple president, and senior apostle. 'These duties he discharged with honor until his death on March 2, 1921, when the Church mourned the passing of a great man and a devoted servant of the Lord. Charles William Penrose The second counselor of President Grant was Charles William Penrose, who was then eighty-six years of age. He was in excellent health and highly respected by both the members of the Church and his numerous acquaintances outside the Church. The years preceding his selection by President Grant had been years of preparation and service for his high calling. President 786 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 CHARLES W. PEN ROSE Penrose was born in Camberwell, London, England, on February 4, 1832, Ata very early age he manifested three unusual traits. First, he was a lover of books, showing a desire to acquire knowledge. Second, he learned to read at an age when most children are concerned entirely with eating and playing. When only four years of age he read the entire Bible, Third, he possessed an unusual memory, being capable of retaining information that he acquired in a very remarkable fashion. During his youth, President PenTose studied the scriptures diligently and, as a result of this study, became dissatisfied with the existing sects of Christendom, being unable to find in them either the religion or the church organization that he read of in the Bible. When he was eightcen years of age he came in contact with the restored gospel and, finding it in agreement with the Bible, was baptized a member of the Church on May 14, 1850. The following January, a month before he was nineteen years of age, he was called on a mission to labor within the British Isles. He had no fjnancial backing, but the Lord provided him with friends and for ten years he labored in Great Britain. The first seven years he was assigned to agricultural areas, and then became President of the Lon. Don district and held other administrative posts in the British Mission. He was a wonderful preacher, being gifted with a powerful, yet pleasIng voice, and 4 fluency of words that enabled him to convince people of his sincerity as well as his ideas, His use of English was unique. He seldom resorted to the use of long or little-used words, but confined himself to the simplest of words in order that the uneducated could gtasp the meaning of his message. Yet there is a gtandeur of thought in his style that manifests the soul of a poet. While engaged as a missionary, President Penrose contributed many articles to the Mil lenial Star dealing with theological and religious Problems. He also wrote poems for its Pages. As the years passed, he longed to gather with the saints in Zion, but year after year his release failed to come. It was then that he wrote "O Ye Mountains High." Ip this song he expressed his longing to be with the body of the Church and be able to serve both the living and the dead. On another occasion when he had been slandered and false accusations had been made against him, he wrote "School Thy Feelings, O My Brother." It was a warning to himself that the Christian thing to do LESSON DEPARTMENT was not to retaliate but to bear the persecution and abuse as Christ would have done. He was finally released in 1861, and emigrated to Utah, settling first at Farmington, where he had to turn from the literary and cultural Pursuits that had characterized his life up to this time, and adjust to the hardships of farming and manual labor. This he willingly did and also taught school for three years, In 1864, he settled in Cache Valley, but the following year he was called again to go on a mission to England, where he served until 1868. His greatest gifts were in the field of mental activities rather than in pioneering, and, in 1870, he moved to Ogden, Utah, where he engaged in newspaper work and represented Weber County in the Territorial Legislature and also in constitutional conventions that were seeking to acquire statehood for the Territory of Utah. In 1877, Brigham Young persuaded him to come to Salt Lake City and join the staff of The Deseret News. Very soon his gifted pen was improving the quality of that Paper and making its editorials sparkle with thought-provoking Comments. In 1880, he was made editor-in-chief of The Deseret News, a position he held for the ensuing twelve years. During this time he was often in Washington, D. C,, where he worked to secure statehood for Utah and also worked for the interests of the Church. Charles W. Penrose later accepted employment as editor-in-chief of the Salt Lake Herald, and for four years devoted his talents to promoting this paper. President Wilford 787 Woodruff appointed him to the position of assistant Church historian, He then devoted his energies to the work of this office and, in addition, wrote articles for the Church peniodicals and for use in the mission fields of the Church. Most noteworthy of his efforts in this respect was the writing of a series of twelve tracts known as "Rays of Living Light." These tracts have been translated into many languages and distributed widely. Millions of them have been used and, so effective are they, that even after more than half a century they are still used by our missionaries, For several years, commencing again in 1899, Elder PenTose was editor-in-chief of The Deseret News and wrote ably and forcefully about world and Church problems. During these years of literary activity, he had not neglected the gospel cause that had brought him to the valleys of the mountains. He served as a local missionary, taught in Sunday Schools and, in 1884, was chosen as a counselor in the Salt Lake Stake presidency. In June of 1904, President Joseph F. Smith Selected him as a member of the Church Board of Education and the following month he was chosen to fill a vacancy in the Council of the Twelve. From December 1906 until June 1910, Charles W. Penrose served as president of the European Mission, with headquarters in Liverpool, England. He supervised the missionary work both in Great Britain and on the Continent of Europe. During this time more than 25,000,000 tracts were distributed and 8,441 baptisms performed. 788 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 When President John Henry Smith died in 1911, Elder Penrose was selected to fill the vacancy in the First Presidency. He was set apart to this office on December 7, 1911, and although he was just two months less than eighty years of age, he had a powerful and vigorous personality. Immediately he threw himself with characteristic energy into the work of the Presidency and became an able assistant to President Smith. He traveled widely in the interests of the Church, visiting the wards and stakes, and took an active part in acquiring possession for the Church of some of the landmarks of early Church history. He was ably assisting President Smith at the time of the latter's death in 1918. President Grant retained him as second counselor and, upon the death of President Anthon H. Lund in March 1921, Brother Penrose, now past eighty-nine, was sustained as first counselor. The unusual energy of this man, strengthened by the Holy Spirit, enabled him to aid President Grant with advice, as a result of his mature years and long experience, and also by actively participating in the Church's ever-growing work. Anthony Woodward Ivins The elevation of President Penrose to the rank of first counselor left a vacancy in the First Presidency. 'To this position Anthony Woodward Ivins was appointed on March 10, 1921. President Ivins was born on 'Tom's River, New Jersey, on September 16, 1852. His mother was a sister of the mother of President Grant, and his father ANTHONY W. IVINS was her cousin. They emigrated to Utah in 1853. In 1861 the parents of Brother Ivins were called to settle in Washington County and it was there that President Ivins grew to manhood and acquired his education. Asa young man, Anthony W. Ivins determined that he would avoid evil company and seek the companionship of boys and men who could help him gain and retain a testimony of the gospel. To his dying day he testified that this had been one of the greatest factors in his life as it had enabled him to learn good habits of living, ideals, moral standards, and habits of industry and integrity. As a consequence, he studied the principles of the gospel and read everything that came into his possession that was noble or uplifting. The formal schooling of Brother Ivins was very meager, as was the case with most boys of pioneer days. However, he read widely and before he had LESSON DEPARTMENT reached the age of thirty, had acquired a good education. During his sojourn in St. George, he held the following positions: constable, city councilor, city attorney, and later, county attorney, mayor, deputy shenff, county assessor and collector, State representative, delegate to the State constitutional convention, and Federal Indian agent. In spite of his lack of classroom education, this self-made lawyer met some of the best school-trained lawyers from the larger cities in court; and the judicial history of the southern part of Utah tells us he never lost a case he defended or prosecuted. In addition to fulfilling these positions of trust and public service for his pioneer community, President Ivins engaged in the cattle and sheep business and at one time was one of the largest livestock operators in Southern Utah, Northern Arizona, and Eastern Nevada. But in spite of these multitudinous duties, he never forgot the Church. He held positions in ward and stake Sunday Schools and the Y. M. M. I. A., served as a missionary among the Navajo Indians of Atizona, was a member of the St. George Stake high council and, in 1888, became first counselor in the presidency of that stake. The Church Authorities had called people to settle in the Mexican State of Chihuahua and, as these Latterday Saint settlements grew, it was decided to organize a stake of Zion for their benefit. In December 1895, Anthony W. Ivins was called to go to Mexico and assume this responsibility. Selling out all of his holdings in land and livestock, he moved to Mexico with his family.
