ery pleasant surprise when I opened my August Relief Society Magazine. I just turned the pages at random, and the picture—the First Presidencies—page 568, caught my eye. John R. Winder was my own father's grandfather; Charles W. Penrose was my dear mother's grandfather, and my husband was christened Anthon Wm. Lundberg, which is so much the same as the name of the counselor. I love The Relief Society Magazine and wait from month to month for it to arrive. At present I am physically handicapped and I cannot go to meetings, so my greatest source of entertainment and recreation is sitting out in the sunshine reading my Relief Society Magazine. Thanks for making it so interesting and inspiring. —Alice Winder Bradford Lundberg, Washington, D. C. I am taking this opportunity to tell you how extremely well I liked the editorial concerning women sewing together (September 1949). It touched a responsive note in me. If women would only sew together more frequently instead of playing so much bridge, there would, I believe, be less unrest.... Some of my most loyal friends are women with whom I sewed in girlhood. I was occupational therapist in a hospital for over seven years and saw women cured of mental illness through being taught to create beauty with the needle, shuttle, crochet hook, and even with only the use of their fingers in making macrame. Even while nursing I taught the art of the needle to my patients during convalescence. It helped to keep them contented and happy. I wish that every woman everywhere might read your editorial. Such articles are much needed. —Gene Romolo, Provo, Utah You would think, from my husband's attitude, that The Relief Society Magazine is published for men only. He hides the Magazine and keeps it hidden until he has read it from cover to cover. Then, it is my turn, and I enjoy every issue. —Alvina A.
