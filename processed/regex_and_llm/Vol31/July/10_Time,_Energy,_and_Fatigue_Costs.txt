Dorius I pledge allegiance to the United States of America, and promise to keep myself physically and mentally fit, because it is my first responsibility as a citizen.?Mary K. Browne, Deputy Director (National Fitness Program, Office of Civilian Defense, Washington, D. C. FORTUNATE are the home. Makers who have developed the right kind of philosophy toward homemaking. Our mental attitude regarding the job before us is extremely important. Through experience and training we build our philosophies of life. These philosophies differ as men and women differ. A family's philosophy of life forms a basic guide for the conduct of its members. The goals of homemaking grow out of this philosophy. It may take years to reach some of these goals, others will come more quickly. Much of the success and happiness we achieve in homemaking comes by having the right attitude toward the work we have to do. "An attitude," says Thomson, "is the result of habitual modes of conduct and in turn becomes a determiner of future conduct." The man and wife who are responsible for the shaping of the new home life begin their task with two sets of attitudes which they have developed out of their past experiences and the system of behavior of the family from which each has come. Their shared experiences and methods of behavior build a third set of attitudes. These three sets of attitudes form the basis of the new family's philosophy.
