Yugoslavia: Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes Dr. Leland Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah [This is the third in a series of articles by Dr. Creer on the historical backgrounds of some of the European countries involved in the present war.] HE origin of the Serb-Croat Slovene Kingdom, since 1929 known officially as Yugoslavia, dates back to the summer of 1917, when a group of leading South Slavs or Yugoslavs, representing Serbia and the South Slavic provinces of Austria-Hungary, met at Corfu (Greece) and signed a pact declaring their intentions to form a new "constitutional, democratic, parliamentary monarchy." It was agreed that the Karageorgevitch dynasty of Serbia should rule the kingdom and that an "appropriate national flag should be adopted, although the three old flags (representing Serbia, Croatia, and Slavonia) might still be hoisted on all occasions." Equality of religion was guaranteed. As soon as possible there was to be elected a constituent assembly by universal, secret, and direct suffrage. This body was charged with the responsibility of preparing a suitable constitution. As finally constituted, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia included the former Serbia and Montenegro; the former Austria-Hungarian provinces of Bosnia, Herzegovinia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slovenia, Slavonia, and portions of Carniola, Styria, and the Banat of Temesvar; and part of western Bulgaria; comprising altogether an area of 96,134 square miles. The population in 1940 numbered Page 360 15,703,000, of whom forty-six per cent were Serbs and thirty-seven per cent were Croats and Slovenes. There were also several hundred thousand Rumanians, and a half a million each of Germans and Magyars. The Serbs are almost exclusively adherents of the Greek Orthodox faith, while the majority of the Croats and Slovenes are Roman Catholics. In addition, there are 1,600,000 Mohammedans scattered throughout the kingdom. The surface of Yugoslavia is largely mountainous. It is drained chiefly by the Danube River and its tributaries, the Morava in the southeast, the Sava and Drava in the northwest, the Tisza in the north, and the Drina in the central west. The coast along the Adriatic is exceedingly irregular and fringed with many islands. Belgrade and Skoplje in Serbia; Zagreb in Croatia; Ljubljana in Slovenia; and Subotica in Slavonia; Cetinje in Montenegro; and Sarajevo in Bosnia are the principal cities. Farming is the chief industry of the people. Nearly fifty-nine per cent of the country is under cultivation. The principal field crops are corn and wheat. The raising of livestock, principally hogs and sheep, is also important. The kingdom has considerable mineral resources, including iron, copper, lead, YUGOSLAVIA Sarajevo 36 Belgrade ?Drawing by Evan Jensen YUGOSLAVIA gold, antimony, and coal. Flour milling is the chief manufacturing industry, although brewing and distilling, weaving, tanning, and pottery-making are important. The wool carpets of Pirot in southeastern Serbia are world famous. Unfortunately, the Corfu Pact was silent as to the form of government, unitary or federal, and _ this omission was destined to cause the greatest of all domestic difficulties; in fact, it was this question which eventually led to the collapse of constitutional government and to the temporary establishment of dictatorship in 1929. The Serbs, in numerical majority, headed by the aged but energetic Premier Nicola Pashich, head of the Serbian. Government when World War I broke out, favored a strongly consolidated unitary form of government; the opposition, headed by the Croats, and led by Stjepan Radich, "a short, stout, nervous, near-sighted man, a prodigious speaker, and ready at all times to give up his life in the cause of his country's autonomy," advocated federalism. Each faction 362 advanced certain arguments. Pashich declared that the backward state of some of the regions, especially those acquired from Hungary, made local autonomy preposterous; Radich, on the other hand, argued that the Croats had enjoyed a degree of autonomy under Austria and that at any rate they, as a group, were more advanced than the Serbs culturally, and consequently should not be subordinate to them. Radich also reminded Pashich that the union of the Croats with the Serbs had been entirely voluntary, wherefore they were at least entitled to make their own local laws. The failure to name the regional units of the country in the Corfu Declaration, coupled with Pashich's well-known pan-Serbian attitude, produced a gloomy impression on the Croatians. Representatives of all political groups in the Zagreb Diet joined in sending a confidential message to the Yugoslav Committee declaring that they found the Pact difficult to accept. Croatians, they pointed out, had for centuries been told about their own state and their national rights; and they were now reluctant to allow Croatia to drown in another state before obtaining her independence. They suggested the formation, if only for a month or a week, of a free, independent Croatia, and a free, independent Slovenia, which would then enter a union with Serbia on an equal basis. This, they stressed, would satisfy the people, and gradually real unity would come about. For two years the question raged. At last, in 1920, the long-awaited call for elections was issued. Despite the fact that Radich and his Croations elected fifty deputies, this group under the fiery Croatian's instructions, refused to take their seats. The assembly, thus purged of the Croatian delegation, adopted a constitution providing for a unitary form of government. Old provincial frontiers were erased and all local diets were abolished. The latter were to be replaced by a single national parliament, the unicameral Skupshtina. Universal suffrage was _ granted, but the people could elect only the members of parliament and a few local officials The latter, moreover, were responsible to the federal authorities. Both king and parliament had the power to initiate legislation, "but the King alone had the right of sanction." As the result of Radich's leadership, the Croats, for four years, refused to take any part whatsoever in the political life of the state. They boycotted parliament and hampered the administration wherever possible. Radich himself spent most of his lifetime in jail or in exile. Finally, in 1925, the Croatians agreed to co-operate provided their party was given representation both in parliament and the cabinet. This led to Radich's release from prison and his appointment as minister of education, an adjustment which led to dismal failure the following year. The death of Pashich, in December 1926, failed to end the controversy. Confusion soon was transformed into chaos, both within parliament and among the people. On several occasions the police had to be called out into the legislative halls to end fighting among the deputies, and riots and outrages became more and more common in the streets. A climax was reached on June 29, 1928. On that day Radich YUGOSLAVIA got up in parliament and launched an especially bitter attack against the government because it Proposed ratification of the Nettuno Convention with Italy (giving Italians the right to possess lands in certain parts of Yugoslavia, as well as the right to import and utilize Italian labor). He complained that the convention was an Italian-Serb compromise drawn up at the expense of the Croatian peasants. Angered by this demonstration, a pro-Serbian deputy arose, drew his pistol, and fired directly into the group of Croatian deputies. Two of the latter died instantly and several, including Radich, were wounded. Radich succumbed to his injuries on August 8, 1928, and the dead leader at once became a saint and a legend. The death of Radich led to the withdrawal of the Croatian deputies from the The death of Radich led to the withdrawal of the Croatian deputies from the Skupshtina, and, within six months, to the complete collapse of parliamentary government. The situation became perilous in the extreme, because of the relative weakness of the kingdom and the none-too friendly attitude of surrounding states. In consequence, King Alexander, on January 6, 1929, after consulting with his friend and ally, Premier Poincare of France, dismissed parliament, abolished the constitution, set up a strict censorship, suppressed all parties and party activities, forbade the bearing of arms and the holding of political meetings, and established a royal dictatorship which was to function through a cabinet directly responsible to him. By royal decree in October 1929, the official name of the polyglot Serb-Croat-Slovene kingdom became designated simply as Yugoslavia. The thirty-three former administrative divisions were wiped out, and instead, nine new districts or banats, named after local rivers, were erected. In six of the banats, te Serbs formed the majority. ON September 3, 1931, King Alexander promulgated a new constitution. It restricted the formation of political parties, recognized the equality of the three major languages, and set up a bicameral Skupshtina, consisting of a senate and a chamber, half of the membership of the former to be appointed by the king. The central government was endowed with broad powers; and the banats were to be ruled by governors appointed by and responsible to the king. A modified electoral law gave the Serbs a distinct advantage in the new government. These new arrangements were opposed vigorously by the minority Croats and Slovenes.
In addition to its nationalistic difficulties, the Yugoslavs were confronted with grave economic problems. The peasants, who formed over eighty per cent of the population, were dissatisfied with the size of their land holdings; the country lacked adequate outlets to the sea and suffered from a poor system of internal communication which made it difficult to develop the mineral resources that were available; finally, the kingdom was burdened with an unusually heavy war debt.
The foreign policy of Yugoslavia may be noted by the following facts: (1) adherence to any pact designed to preserve the territorial integrity of the Balkan States created by the Treaty of Trianon, hence Yugoslavia's association with the Little Entente (1921), an alliance 364 created primarily for the purpose of preventing the restoration of the Hapsburg dynasty and the initiation of Hungarian irredentism; (2) nationalistic aspirations noted in the consistent attempts of the state to receive guarantee of egress on the Adriatic through some assurance of control over the important city of Fiume, and in the dogged determination of the state to incorporate portions of Macedonia claimed by Greece and Hungary; and (3) the continued friendship of the kingdom for France her ally, protector and creditor, and most adamant defender of the League of Nations and the postwar treaties, which were in turn responsible for the very existence of the Slavic state. The agitation to preserve areas occupied by Macedonians has precipitated bitter feelings with Hungarians and Greeks as well as with the nationalistic Macedonians themselves; the quarrel with Italy over the important Adriatic port of Fiume forced the settlement of 1924, known as the Treaty of Rome, whereby Italy was awarded the coveted city, while Yugoslavia received the port of Baros and a fifty-year lease on part of the fine harbor of Fiume. Access of the Yugoslavs to the Aegean Sea was guaranteed through treaty with the Greeks in 1925. This pact, modified in minor details in 1929, provided for (1) the creation of a free zone covering 94,000 square meters at Salonica, the area to be under Greek legal and police surveillance but to be under Yugoslav customs administration; and (2) the abolition of tariff rates for goods passing between the free zone and the Yugoslav frontier. The centralizing tendencies of King Alexander were undoubtedly responsible for the assassination of the Serbian Monarch on October 9, 1934. On that day, the King disembarked at Marseilles from the Yugoslav Destroyer Dubrovinik, bound on an official visit to France. As he and Foreign Minister Barthou of France were riding together through the city, an assassin leaped upon the running board and shot the King dead. The murderer, killed upon the spot even before he could shoot himself, was found to be a Macedonian anarchist who was acting under the inspiration of a Croatian terrorist organization. The immediate result of the assassination was the precipitation of ill feeling between Yugoslavia and Hungary which almost led to war, because the headquarters of the Croatian extremists were in Hungary near the Yugoslav border, and because before the assassination, the Hungarians, despite repeated protests, had been unable to control the radical movement. Fortunately, however, for the peace of Europe, the Council of the League of Nations was able to solve the crisis to the satisfaction of both parties. Meanwhile, Alexander's eldest son, a boy of eleven years, was proclaimed King Peter II. Under a Regency Council, the new government set about to establish order. Opposition leaders were arrested, and anti-government meetings were broken up. However, the Croats refused to co-operate, and their leader Matchech made it clear that his people would never be satisfied until the Croats were granted an autonomous position in Yugoslavia analogous to that of Hungary in the Dual Monarchy before World War I. YUGOSLAVIA  It was clear, therefore, that in 1941, the year of the Nazi invasion, the conflict between federalism and centralism in Yugoslavia seemed little nearer to a settlement than it had in 1920, first year of the existence of the new Slavic kingdom. As an organized state, Yugoslavia officially collapsed on April 17, 1941, when the Yugoslav minister of war and the chief of staff, on the authorization of Premier Dushan Siminovitch, but without the knowledge of the rest of the government, signed a capitulation agreement with the German command. Within a week the partitioning of the hapless state was completed according to Nazi plans. For his Quisling in Serbia proper, Hitler appointed General Milan Nedich, of the Yugoslav army, an ardent German sympathizer. The Fuehrer permitted the Bulgarians to overrun parts of south Serbia and Yugoslav Macedonia, and loosed the Magyars on Noyvodina. Croatia proper was made an "independent, free state," under Quisling Anti Pavelitch, appointed by and subservient to Italy's dictator, Mussolini. The Italians were permitted to occupy the Croatian coast, Montenegro, Dalmatia, and a part of Herzegovinia. The Germans held Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, and a few other key points in Herzegovinia and Serbia. The occupation of Yugoslavia, as was expected, was accompanied by much bloodshed and terrorism. Nazi leaders were quick to take advantage of and to exploit the many factors and circumstances which had kept the country divided and in constant turmoil and conflict. 365 Thus federalists were enticed to oppose more vigorously the centralists; Roman Catholics were set against adherents of the Greek Orthodox faith; Croatians and Slovenes were incited against the domineering Serbs; the urban bourgeois were encouraged to take up arms against guerrilla bands of rural Communists. In this chaotic struggle between the contending factions of the South Slav state, the Communists, fed in spirit, at least in part, by the inspiration of their mother country, Russia, appeared to advantage. This was natural. The cause of most of the people in Yugoslavia was emotionally, nationally, socially, economically, geographically closer to Russia's than to any other great Power's. Thousands of Yugoslav peasants organized into guerrilla bands called Partisans, determined to fight to the death the Nazi and Fascist invaders, but also to resist with equal fury those who by force of arms tried to destroy their Communistic organization. On the other hand, there were many peasants, impregnated with Nazi and anti-Communist propaganda, who saw in the warfare conducted by the Partisan guerrillas, only a renewed menace to their own safety because the ruthless activities of the Partisans were provoking the Nazis and Fascists to even greater acts of terrorism. In this fearful situation, toward the end of 1941, some peasants had organized into anti-Partisan guerrilla bands. In some instances this ?counter-guerrilla movement was supported by those who wanted to end the revolution by a program of compromise or appeasement. Yet stronger than the appeasing tendency of the anti-guerrillas 366 las was the tendency to fight the enemy at any and all costs. AFTER liberating the South Slavs, what steps should be taken to insure the happiness of these war torn people? What should form the bases of reconstruction? First of all it should be increasingly clear that if Yugoslav unity is to be assured, some form of federalism in the political arrangement must replace the pre-war centralism, which had made possible the domination of the Serbs. How many autonomies or semi-autonomous units there will be in the Yugoslav federation is left to the future. Certainly there should be a united Serbia, a Croatia, a Slovenia, a Montenegro. Perhaps an autonomous Bosnia, Herzegovinia, or even Yugoslav Macedonia should be created. Beyond this, the idea of a still wider Balkan federation with Yugoslavia included as a single unit might be desirable, and, from an economic point of view, decidedly advantageous. The unfortunate experiences of the Yugoslavs in the past, under dominant French, Austrian, British, German, and Italian influence, has prompted the peasantry, and _ this means the fighting guerrillas?the teal liberators of the state?to look toward Russia rather than to western Europe and America for aid in the solution of their problem. If liberation should be achieved by the autumn of 1944, it is estimated that fully 1,500,000 Yugoslavs will have perished in warfare, by execution, starvation, and epidemics at home or in German and Italian slavery, and by other methods of depopulation. This means a loss of about ten per cent?an astounding figure. Hundreds of villages and towns are completely destroyed; those partially ruined are beyond count. When liberation comes, about eight million people in Yugoslavia will be undernourished and inadequately clothed. There will be at least a half million recently orphaned children. The food supply will be low. For more than two years an enemy army of 525,000 men has been eating off the country, whose production in 1942, at best, was less than half of normal, owing to guerrilla warfare and other dislocations. 'The problem of economic rehabilitation in the entire Balkan area undoubtedly will be one of the most acute and complex of the problems at the Peace Conference. One thing certain, the new Yugoslavia will want, more than anything else, a guaranteed freedom from tyranny. The guerrillas, especially, will demand relief from despotism and terrorism. The Yugoslavs will demand a new order of things?collective security, collaboration with neighboring peoples?a safeguard against a recurrence of the experiences of the past. 'They will resent and resist to the utmost any attempt to restore the old regime. Finally, there is a genuine demand among the people for the establishment of democratic institutions. Each component part of the federated state should draft its own constitution, which should include a Bill of Rights with the minimum guarantees of freedom of speech, assembly, petition, and religion. The democratic idealism of the Yugoslav in its larger sense is best expressed (Continued on page 390) ~
