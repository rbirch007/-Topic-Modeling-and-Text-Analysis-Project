Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, July 1, and July 15, 1884. "The RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS" Editorial Notes: Elder John Q. Cannon, who has been absent on a mission to Europe nearly three years, returned on the 24th of June, accompanied by his wife, Annie W [ells] Cannon, whose letters of travel have been published in the Exponent, and have been very interesting, as we have had abundant evidence from our readers.. On Saturday, July 12th, at 2 p. M., Dr. Ellis B. Shipp's class underwent their final examination before entering upon the practice of obstetrics. The examination was made by Doctors Heber John Richards, Wm. Bowers and Wilford B. Shipp. The names of the students were Hannah Burnham and Mary C. Shipp, Draper; Mary Swindle, Monroe; Esther Hunsaker, Honeyville; A. J. Tippets, Cecilia Neilson, Caroline Hanson, Lizzie Evans, Ellen Stark, Brigham City; Caroline Isom, Mantua; Hannah Anderson, Bear River City. The Doctors expressed themselves well pleased with the way in which the students acquitted themselves. Refreshments, ice cream, fruit, etc., were afterwards served to all. A Editorial: Ladies, Go and Vote.?In view of the August election which is now drawing near, we wish to remind the ladies of Utah who are entitled to vote, that the Primary meetings in the several precincts will convene July 21; and it is their privilege to attend and take part in the proceedings.... It is the sacred duty of every woman who has the right of suffrage to go to the polls on election day and deposit her ballot.... Every person should consider the vote he or she casts as though it was the one to turn the scale in favor of the man or men to be elected. It is not only the public duty, but it is an individual responsibility and one that no one can perform for his friend or neighbor, but must be done in person....RELIEF SOCIETY REPORTS Sisters Eliza R. Snow Smith, Margaret P. Young and Elizabeth Howard went to Grantsville on Friday, June 13, to attend the Sisters' Conference of Tooele Stake, which commenced on the 14th and closed on the 15th. There was a Primary Fair held also, which was a very successful affair, and the little children's work, much of it, was very artistic and particularly well executed. On Sunday, June 15, a special meeting was held at Granger Ward, for the purpose of organizing a Relief Society in the ward, which has only recently been set off and fully organized. Bishop D. McCrae presided over the meeting.... The Bishop proceeded to organize by placing before the meeting the names of Sister Mary E. Porter as President; Sister Elizabeth Park, First Counselor; Sister Mary A. Bess, Second Counselor; Sister Catherine Makay, Secretary; Sister Betsey Hall, Assistant Secretary; Sister Phyldes Warr, Treasurer.... The meeting was afterwards addressed by Sisters B. W. Smith, M. W. Wilcox and E. B. Wells, who were present by invitation.... The Cover: The cover is from a drawing by Evan Jensen.
