Joseph Smith's First Vision Objective: To show how God can be reached and that His way of speaking to the world is still through chosen men. 2. The Book of Mormon Revealed Objective: To show that "in the mouth of two or three witnesses, shall every word be established." 3. The Priesthood of God Restored Objective: To outline' the steps by which man was again given authority from on high. 4-The Church ' of Jesus Christ Organized Objective: To study the simple and direct way in which the Church organization wes effected to keep alive the Gospel truths. 5. The Kirtland Period Objective: To study the "rising up and coming forth of My Church out of the wilderness," 6. The Missouri Period Objective: To study the main events in Missouri that lead up to and followed the location of the City of Zion and the central gathering place of the Saints. 7.

A Period of Prophecy Objective: To establish the test of a true prophet and to study the events that prompted the words of the modern seer, Joseph Smith. The main text to be used in the study of this course is the Doctrine and Covenants Commentary. In addition, and as supplementary to this, any or all of the approved histories of the Church may be consulted. These will all prove of value. One thought may add purpose in the presentation of the lessons for the teacher and class. Fine histories of the Church have been written and will again be written, but for the spirit which has prompted them and will again prompt more, one must ever turn to the word of the Lord, in this case the Doctrine and Covenants. Such is the great source of inspiration for the layman and scholar alike. If we would know more of the history of the Church and the doctrine as it was revealed, what better way is there than by a close study of these words of the Lord in our day? As to the method of class discussion bear the following in mind: Somehow in too many lessons practically all of the material is given in the written lesson itself. The teacher covers this part fairly well. When, LESSON DEPARTMENT however, she reaches the discussion period, she poses questions that draw a weak response. To this she must then supplement her own contribution. In overcoming such difficulty there is the necessity of putting real content into the discussion period. In the case of the present series, this is done by directing class members to the words of the Lord as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. 399 Once a class, after attempting to answer a simple but searching question, is turned to the clear and convincing facts as phrased by the Master, hearts are warmed; and minds, seeking ready confirmation of truth, recall personal illustrations which press for expression?testimonies result and the teacher assumes her rightful role as director, rather than taskmaster of the hour. Lesson I?Joseph Smith's First Vision "Who giveth to all men liberally" (James 1:5) For Tuesday, October 3, 1944 Central theme of course: "By their fruits ye shall know them." Lesson Objective: 'To show how God can be reached, and that His way of speaking to the world is still through chosen men. ? THEY draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me; they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof" (Writings of Joseph Smith, 2:19). Joseph Smith listened, amazed at what he saw and heard. There above him in the bright spring air stood two glorious Personages?the Father and the Son! There! Come because he had "asked of God" which of all the sects was right, that he might know which to join. Surely God "giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not" if He would thus appear to answer so personal a question, and for such an obscure boy. So overcome was Joseph that at first he could scarcely recall the purpose that had brought him to the upland grove upon his father's farm, that beautiful day in the year of 1820. Little did he think that his "venture" would so completely reveal "the power thereof" of darkness as well as light. For before the blessed relief of this glorious vision had burst around him, he was set upon, he wrote, "by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction. But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver 400 me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction?not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being?just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than | found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name, and said, pointing to the other? "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" (Writings of Joseph Smith, 2:15-17). Joseph did "Hear Him" to learn he was not to join any of the churches of the world. With these deep impressions upon his mind and paled by the might of such a soul-awakening experience he went home. As he leaned against the fireplace, his mother, sensing a different look in her son, asked what was the matter. True even then to the trust God had placed in him, he spoke not directly of the Lord's power which had that day made known the wishes of his heart, but answered correctly and well the inquiry of his mother by saying, "Never mind, all is well?I am well enough off. I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true." (Writings of Joseph Smith, 2:20). His mother had joined the Presbyterians. Thus did an unlettered youth of simple faith and trust in God find answer to his first vocal prayer. What was the background of this youth in his fifteenth year of life that so shaped him to be the one who would rock the very foundations of the Christian world, which were laid, as the Lord had told him, upon "a form of godliness but denied the power thereof?" Briefly, they were those of a boy reared in a family of integrity, virtue, and purity of heart, made real by faith in God which is often enhanced in humble surroundings. Joseph Smith was born in Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, on the twenty-third day of December, 1805. In his tenth year, he with his family moved to Palmyra, Ontario (now Wayne) County, New York. Some four years later, the family moved into Manchester in the same county. Joseph's father, an honest farmer, had found himself in hard financial circumstances, having lost much of his holdings through the unscrupulous acts of a trusted friend. Seven sons and three daughters, Joseph being the fourth child, made up the family of Joseph Smith Senior." Into the new Ontario County of western New York together with the (1) Documentary History of the Church, Vol. I, p. 2, and Writings of Joseph Smith 2:4, list six sons and three daughters as constituting the children of Joseph Smith, Senior and Lucy Mack Smith. History of the Prophet Joseph by Lucy Mack Smith, pp. 36-37, and Life of Joseph Smith by George Q. Cannon, p. 5, list seven sons and three daughters. Is omitted in the first two references. The name of a son, Ephraim, born March 13, 1810, died March 24, 1810, LESSON DEPARTMENT Smith family had come many other people, mostly poor and plain in dress and manners. These helped to swell the then thinly populated regions. One thing in common had touched all these early upstate settlers, and that was religion. The Bible was read and regular church attendance expected. Camp meetings and religious revivals brought enthusiastic crowds to be swayed by the eloquent words of the leading ministers of the various sects, who cried, "Lo here! And Lo there!" Palmyra, then but a small community, was not without its religious denominations. As if to indicate the intensity of the religious rivalry at that time, four of the faiths in this small town held their meetings on opposite corners of the same crossroads. The Smith family in the year 1820 was divided on matters of religion. Four of them had joined the Presbyterians. Young Joseph himself had inclined toward the Methodists, but he was troubled not so much as to a specific church as to the reasons for all the disunion that existed among the faiths. "What is to be done?" he wrote, "Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?" (Writings of Joseph Smith 2:10). It was in this state of mind that he one day read the Epistle of James, the first chapter and the fifth verse, which reads: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." "Never did any passage of scripture," he wrote, "come with more 401 power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine." He believed, and acted upon his belief. The Bible is the word of God; why then should not God do as He had said! He would! What sweeter faith and reasoning is there to be found than that of youth when it cuts through to the true source of knowledge! By this simple act of belief which sent Joseph to pray, he did more than find the answer to his personal problem. He reached the heart of His Maker who having found again true humility could shape a great prophet and right a darkened world once more?a world sadly in need of the power as well as the form of godliness. Yes, Joseph was the instrument and 1820 the year. God would begin then for the last time His work of the fullness of salvation among men. And through the efforts of this humble boy would the world come, as of old, to know of eternal life. Small wonder that Joseph never forgot that he had "seen a light, and in the midst of that light... Two Personages" and They did in reality speak to him. And though he was to be persecuted all the days of his life for so declaring yet he knew and dared not deny, neither would deny, that he had seen a vision. As he walked in the fresh spring air down the lane that lead from the grove?a Sacred Grove now?His Lord, a living Savior who called him by name, had left in his soul the music of an Eternal Voice. Could Joseph ever forgot that Voice! Does one ever forget the voice of a loved one? Never! And that Voice, though it came like the rushing of a 402 mighty wind or with the still quiet assurance of a loving father, would ever be known to Joseph. And Joseph, like the chosen disciples of old, with ear attuned, would ever listen to its solemn counsel. Through Joseph Smith the world today has the words that Voice uttered for our times, "pregnant with wisdom and purpose, throwing a flood of light upon the Gospel." Blessed is he that reads and keeps these words which may be found recorded in the book this. Modern prophet gave, the book of the Doctrine and Covenants. Suggestions for Active Reading And Discussions In this series of lessons designed to tell again the more important facts of the history of the Church and the Church doctrine as it was revealed, all those who would gain the most from a classroom and personal study of the material prepared might well bear in mind the following thought: Look upon the Doctrine and Covenants, which is to be the basic text for this course, not as just another book, but as the recording (which it truly is) of God's direct word to you in this day. 'True, your name will not appear in any of the revelations, as did many of the names of the early members of the Church, but what was said_ to them as to the enduring principles of life will hold good for you now and in the days that lie ahead.... "my word,.. Is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword,... therefore give heed,..." saith the Lord (Doc. & Cov. 6:2). Fortunate indeed is he who through faith accepts this statement of truth and suffers not the pain of its sharpness through error. With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto His word" which has been written especially for us in this day. 1. May one expect the Lord to fulfill His promise today, given in James 1:5, as He did to Joseph Smith? Read the word of the Lord to the second elder of His Church, Oliver Cowdery, as it is recorded in Doctrine and Covenants, Section 6. Note especially verses 14 to 24. For the full effect of this part of the lesson development the teacher should have 'at hand the Doctrine and Covenants Commentary to supply the pertinent facts of Church history found there between the passages of this section. (*) 2. There are two parts to the objective in today's lesson. What specifically does the second part mean to you? After a full discussion of this question have one of the best readers of your class voice the whole of Doctrine and Covenants, Section 1, without interruption. The next question may be used if needed for further class activity or it may be assigned for home study. 3. What passage or passages in Doctrine and Covenants, Sections 1 and 6, have you come to feel of personal worth? passages which you will keep in memory? Read these and relate your feelings about them. Read the extracts from the Writings of Joseph Smith found in the Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith 2:1-26. (*) Caution: This question and the reading of Doc. & Cov., Section 6, in connection with it are intended to enlarge the lesson objective. Such will be the case if the class is held particularly to that part of the revelation which makes clear that the Lord enlightens the mind of each of us by the "Spirit of truth" when we inquire of Him. Note verses 14-17. LESSON DEPARTMENT Visiting Teachers? Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes Preview of Lessons for 1944-45 THE visiting teachers' messages for the 1944?45 educational year, like those for 1943?44, are planned under the general heading 'Sources of Strength." There is no greater source of strength and comfort than the teachings of the Savior. In all the world's vast amount of literature there is nothing more _ beautiful, more meaningful, more precious than the Sermon on the Mount. It is indeed one of the most priceless things preserved to us in letters. The Beatitudes are a well-known and deeply appreciated part of the Sermon on the Mount. In them the Savior taught basic truths in the most effective way. There is no element of coercion nor compulsion in them, neither do they contain threats. Rather, glorious promises are held out to those who observe them. Messages for the coming year are based on the Beatitudes. This seems a particularly appropriate time to give thought to these beautiful and comforting truths, which are as needed today as when they were given by the Savior. Messages are planned for the eight months as follows: 1.
