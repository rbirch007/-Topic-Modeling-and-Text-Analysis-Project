Theology meetings for members, also recommended to be held monthly during the eightmonth period totaled 32,187, and a similar number of local preparation meetings would be expected. These, however, numbered only 7,018, indicating that preparation meetings should be from four to five times as extensive as at present.. The General Board is preparing specific suggestions for the conduct of these meetings which it is hoped will help increase the number held and result 374 in a corresponding improvement in the conduct of Relief Society work. The continued decline in stake meetings was due to wartime travel restrictions. The principal explanation of the one exception, an increase in number of meetings held in lieu of union meetings, was the series of regional and stake discussion meetings conducted during the fall of 1943 by representatives of the General Board with special permission of the First Presidency, which reached 142 stakes and mission districts in the Western States. The regular ward Relief Society meetings for members (weekly during eight-month period October through May, and monthly during four-month period May through September) totaled 55,758?an increase of 1,514 or 3 per cent from 1942, despite the fact that the number of local organizations decreased by 38. This increase therefore indicates expansion toward the full Relief Society program by some local Societies operating on a partial basis. Following the trend of the previous year, attendance at Relief Society meetings again declined in 1943, but, like the decline in membership, at a greatly slackened rate. The drop in average attendance during 1943 was 2,574 or 8 per cent, whereas the decline the previous year was 24 per cent or nearly 10,000 less members at Relief Society meetings each week. On the average, in 1943, there were 28,696 members in attendance at each meeting, representing 28 per cent of the total enrollment. It must be remembered that average attendance does not indicate the total number of members who attended at one time or another during the calendar year, and that the number of different members attending once or more during the year would be considerably greater. Reduced attendance again reflects war conditions and greatly increased employment of women. Nevertheless, it is believed that this attendance record might be improved and that Relief Society officers throughout the Church might well refer again to the suggestions of the General Board given in Bulletin 27, dated September 3, 1942, with a view to increasing attendance at Relief Society meetings by those women who are able to participate. The popularity of the four weekly meetings for members is indicated in the following summary table of average attendance in relation to type of lesson presented.
