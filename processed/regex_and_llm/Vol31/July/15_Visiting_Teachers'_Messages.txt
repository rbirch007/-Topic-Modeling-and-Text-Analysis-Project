Visiting Teachers' Messages? Sources of Strength: The Beatitudes Literature?Literature of the New Testament. Social Science?Modern Application of Ethical Principles Home Topics Discontinued The home topics, heretofore planned for optional use on work-and-business day, have been discontinued. (See announcement p. 387.) However, there will appear in Theexcellent articles on homemaking, particularly the series "General Housekeeping Problems" by Claire P. Dorius, which will lend themselves to discussion by Relief Societies desiring such activity simultaneously with sewing at the work meeting. Such discussions should not, however, interfere with nor in any way displace sewing, which is to be the major activity of the day. No Special Courses No special course in lieu of any of the regular courses of study has been planned for missions or organizations outside the United States, as heretofore. The regular courses of study planned for the ensuing year are suitable for use by all Relief Societies. In some instances adaptations may be necessary, but the fundamental message of each lesson is appropriate for all Societies irrespective of their location or local conditions. No Social Science Lesson for December 26 Only seven lessons are included in the social science course. No lesson is scheduled for December 26 as Relief Societies are not required to hold meetings during Christmas week, Teaching Methods Skill in the use of different methods or procedures forms an important part of the class leader's preparation for her work. Method is but a way of using lesson materials for the accomplishment of desired purposes. It is a way of doing; a means to an end. There are various types of teaching methods or procedures, differing in general merit or value; that method is best which obtains the best results in the best way. In determining the method to be employed during a given class period, Page 395 396 the class leader should consider the nature of the subject matter, the teaching aims or purposes, the size and character of the class, and even the physical conditions of the classroom. Too often class leaders, gaining mastery of one or two specific methods, use these to the exclusion of other methods that would be more suitable to the material and the class situation. The most successful class leader is the one who is familiar with and apt in the use of a variety of teaching procedures. Variety of method should also be employed from time to time to prevent monotony, which is always deadening. Relief Society class leaders are urged to avail themselves of opportunities to become familiar with a variety of teaching procedures, particularly those which have been proved especially suitable for adult groups. Books on teaching may be found in school and public libraries. The Relief Society and other Church auxiliaries frequently publish articles on this subject, and excellent help may be obtained by observing the work of skilled class leaders. Specific suggestions and definite recommendations on method have accompanied some of the 1943?44 courses of study. During the coming educational year, the lessons as _written will suggest methods to employ in teaching them, but no specific recommendation on method will accompany any lesson. Leads For Class Leaders The book, Leads For Class Leaders, to be published by the Relief Society General Board, announced in The, page 655, is still in process of preparation. Announcement will be made in Thewhen the book is ready for use. Enrichment Material An excellent map of the United States suitable for use in teaching the Church history lessons is published on pp. 384-385 of this issue of the Magazine. This map will be helpful throughout the entire three-year course; therefore, it is suggested that class leaders carefully preserve this issue of the Magazine as back issues are not always available. However, separate copies of the map will be available to class leaders at five cents each by writing the Relief Society General Board, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. It is the plan of the General Board to provide, from time to time through Thepictures and articles suitable for enrichment and for supplementary reading in connection with the various courses of study. Attention will be called to these at the end of the lessons for which they are planned. Correspondence on Lessons Class leaders occasionally have a problem related to a lesson or a question regarding a lesson. Ward class leaders having problems or questions should consult their respective Relief Society stake leaders. Stake class leaders having questions should consult the Relief Society General Board. Such correspondence should be addressed to the Relief Society General Board and not to the authors of the lessons or to other Church offices. Textbooks and Special References Point of view Should be kept in Textbooks for the respective courses should be made available to the class leaders of these courses from Relief Society funds. Upon completion of the courses, the textbooks should be returned to the Society to become a part of its library. Although the special reference books mentioned at the end of the lessons are helpful to class leaders, it is not essential that these be purchased; in some instances it is not even advisable. Many of these books may be found in school or public libraries, and the limited use of them in connection with the lessons makes it advisable to use library copies rather than to purchase the books. The General Board does not endorse all that is contained in all of the books referred to in the lessons. In using reference books, the Latter-day Saint point of view should be kept in mind, and all material presented in the classroom should be evaluated from that point of view. The following books referred to in the previews or lessons may be purchased by Relief Society members at the special price listed, from Deseret Book Company, 44 East South Temple Street, Salt Lake City 1, Utah.

Theology Church History Preview of Lessons for 1944-45 A PREVIEW of a three-year course of study entitled, "Church History" introduces the lessons for the year 1944?45. Titles for eight of the twenty-four lessons and their objectives, together with the broad outline for each of the three years of study arc presented in this preview. The Savior when asked how one would know His people, replied, ''By their fruit so ye shall know them." The fruits of Mormonism after more than a century are abundantly plentiful and good. He who would in fairness read the history of their planting and growth may find fulfillment and satisfaction in the truth of the Master's words. It is with this thought that one should study the present Church history course during the next three years. Within this central theme will come the three divisions of the course: Part I for 1944?45 is devoted to the opening of the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times and has 398 for its objective the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the coming forth of the "church out of the wilderness"; Part II for 1945?46 outlines the story of the Saints in their movement to "the place which God prepared" in the tops of the everlasting mountains; Part III for 1946?47 pertains to the coming-of age period of the Church with its broadened activities meeting the swift sweep of our modern times. The main objective of the course is to narrate the more important events of Church history and to consider the revelations in their relation to the historical episodes. We revere the revelations contained in the book of Doctrine and Covenants as the revealed word of God for our day. The titles of the eight lessons for this year's course follow: 1.
