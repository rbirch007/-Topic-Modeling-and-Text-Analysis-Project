This course is planned to get those who study it to read and reread this Scripture. We believe with Dr. Moulton that "many have a longing to get to the sacred texts at firsthand, to fling their minds, without any intervening medium of interpretation, directly upon the original literature, and appreciate it in all its freshness." In the King James translation, we have the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation?all living literature.

Some notes in this book are also helpful.

It is helpful for ease of reading in the classroom.

Note: Other books may be suggested as the course is developed. Lesson 1 Historical Literature of the New Testament For Tuesday, October 17, 1944 THERE are two main ways of writing history. In one, the emphasis is on recording facts; in the other, while keeping true to fact, the historian portrays life. This second type has been well called historical literature. In the Gospel according to St. Luke, we have historical literature of the highest kind. These sections of the New Testament not only record with fidelity events in the life of our Savior and His apostles, but they present these events as living history. St. Luke, an educated Gentile, secretary to the Apostle Paul, was well prepared for his - masterful authorship. His preface to his Gospel reads: Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, 2. Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word. 3. It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent 'Theophilus, 4. That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed?Luke 1:1-4). He had a burning testimony of the Gospel. As he says, (Luke 1:2) he had received the sacred story and message of the Master. From Paul, whose inspiring story and words he had recorded, and from other devoted leaders of those early days, he had caught the spirit and inner meaning of true Christianity. Surcharged with these riches of information and inspiration, he felt impelled to write the story as he had learned and lived it. While the Gospel of St. Luke is addressed to Theophilus, a leader in the Roman Empire, who evidently had sought to learn more of Christ and His great work, its message is for all the world. St. Luke tells the story clearly, fervently, and "in order." With well-constructed, rhythmic sentences it is moved forward. Significant incidents add life; words 408 of light and truth faithfully woven into the text help to lift it into divine history. An excellent beginning study of New Testament literature is the reading of St. Luke. This gives in sequence a historical account of the life and message of our Savior. In these words of St. Luke, we have something comparable to the historical books of the Old Testament. To know the history of the Chosen People and Christ and His Apostles, is to have a sound basis for understanding and appreciating the other 'great literature of the Old and the New Testament. If class members would get close to the Gospel of St. Luke, they should read the Book itself. One should be a bit jealous of his privilege of enjoying this living history firsthand. A good plan is to set aside a Sabbath afternoon for this spiritual recreation. Perhaps some member or members of the family, or some neighbor would like to share the uplift. If so, an added joy will come from reading these Scriptures aloud. Let the first reading be mainly for the history itself; discussions may follow during the rereading which one will surely desire to do later. Happily, the writings of St. Luke are easy to follow. They move with clarity and something of musical charm. Through them, outstanding events in the life of the Master from its earthly beginning to the resurrection, are developed in natural sequence. Under the skillful hand of an inspired historian, these world shaping events are brought together like links in a golden chain. To get nearer to the style and spirit of this fine historical literature, read the following excerpts from the Gospel of St. Luke: And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth (Luke 1: 11-14). Ee & And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart (Luke 2:15-19). X ok And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions.... And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? (Luke 2:43 ff). Following the brief account of the births of John and Jesus and this one illuminating view of the boyhood of our Savior, St. Luke carries forward the story. The great work of John as "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord" (Luke 3:4), and the baptism of Jesus are sketched with artistry. Following this comes the genealogy of the Savior. Then the testing temptation by the Devil is related simply, dramatically.
From this crisis, nobly met, the story is developed through one significant event after another. Words of the Savior are woven into the stirring narrative at appropriate places, making it glow with gems of wisdom. Finally, The Gospel According to St. Luke is brought to its natural close with the story of the crucifixion and the resurrection.
(1) "The Temptation of Jesus," will be treated in Lesson 2, "Story Telling in the New Testament."
Suggestions for Discussion and Activities
1. (a) What is the essential difference between plan history and historical literature? (b) Why must each of these be based on fact to be convincing and lasting? (c) Give illustrations of historical literature outside the New Testament.
2. What are two characteristics that lift the writings of St. Luke to a high standard of literary history?
3. Have some member of the class read aloud the excerpts from St. Luke given in the lesson.
4. Let members of the class, previously assigned, continue the reading by giving in their order these other "high points" in the story of the Savior and His Apostles: (a) Jesus Teaches the Nazarenes (Luke 4: 16-24); (b) Jesus Casts out a Devil (Luke 4:32-37); (c) Jesus calls Peter and Others to the Ministry (Luke 5: 1-11); (d) Jesus Answers the Pharisees (Luke 6: 1-15); (e) Jesus Heals the Centurion's Servant (Luke 7:1-9).
Note: The foregoing quotations are suggested as typical ones showing the lucid style of St. Luke. As they or other excerpts from his Gospel are read aloud, note how clear and rhythmic is his record of the events. Other choice selections may, of course, be taken.
5. Why is it of basic importance in the study of literature that one learn first the historic background? Illustrate with reference to our own story of America and its literature.

Social Science
Modern Applications of Ethical Principles
Preview of Lessons for 1944-45
THE social service lessons outlined for this year and next will deal with the field of social ethics. Our decision to devote this much time to a study of this subject grows out of our sincere belief that much of the confusion and despair in the modern world results from man's inclination to desert the great moral principles of the ages. Modern living is too superficial and hedonistic to bring the peace and happiness so much desired by everyone; there is need for a quick and complete return to virtue.
In treating the subjects chosen for discussion we will attempt to present materials and develop points of view that will be helpful in righteous living. 410 Our concern will be more with the present and the future than with the past, and our approach will be more analytic and synthetic than dogmatic. In other words, our aim is practical rather than theoretical. We are anxious to present a series of helps to better living that will be understood and will find application in the lives of Latter-day Saints. For this reason our emphasis will be upon immediate social situations rather than remote philosophical abstractions. The first year's lesson series will deal largely with ethical principles; and the second year's with areas of application, but there will be overlapping of these phases all the way through, and an_ ever-present attempt to see principles side by side with applications in real life situations. Lesson titles for the first year are as follows: 1.
