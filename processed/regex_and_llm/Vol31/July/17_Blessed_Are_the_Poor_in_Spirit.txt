Blessed Are They Which Are Persecuted for Righteousness Sake Through a discussion of these subjects in the homes, faith should be strengthened, and those visited should be left comforted, encouraged, and sustained. Messages as planned for the ensuing year are very simple. No additional references are given nor are study suggestions or questions for discussion included. Visiting teachers' messages are supplied for the purpose of providing a basis for uplifting and profitable discussion in the homes, and to circumvent conversation that might prove depressing or detrimental to anyone in any way. It is not intended that discussions, either in the teacher-training meetings or in the homes, assume the proportions of a major lesson. Time, in both situations, precludes this. In discussing the message in the teacher-training meeting, it is suggested that class leaders do not enlarge too much upon the subject as presented in the Magazine. Even though a wide knowledge of subject matter is an advantage to a teacher. Where too many ideas in relation to a subject are crowded into a short period of time, thinking often becomes confused. Where thinking is confused, expression will also be confused, Therefore, rather than helping 404 visiting teachers to use the message more effectively, the presentation of too much material may actually be detrimental to a successful discussion in the homes. In fact, it may even cause visiting teachers to be reluctant to use the message at all. Visiting teachers, in most instances, will be more benefited if the ideas of the message as published in the Magazine are made to stand out clearly and distinctly. Subject matter should be so treated that the central message of the lesson is made plain, and its appropriateness and adaptability for use in the homes established. 'The natural divisions into which the subject matter falls might be pointed out, and the essential ideas which group themselves about each natural division considered, in logical sequence, in such a way as to help visiting teachers to see them distinctly, to understand them, and to see their relationship to the central message. Time might occasionally be devoted to methods of dealing with the message in the homes. With such preparation as a foundation, visiting teachers, imbued with the spirit of their work and understanding the purpose of the message, may then draw upon their own additional knowledge, experience, and judgment to present the message in the homes so that it will catch the interest of those visited, meet with response, and accomplish the good intended. Visiting teacher class leaders should not lose sight of the fact that they are training visiting teachers to present a message effectively in the homes; their responsibility is more than a smooth, beautiful unfoldment of a lesson before a group of class members. Lesson I?Blessed Are the Poor in Spirit For Tuesday, October 3, 1944 "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 5:3). Objective: To develop an appreciation of the blessings promised by the Savior to those who are "poor in spirit." IN this Beatitude is found the answer to the questions that motivate men in all that they do. "What shall I do to be happy? What will bring to me the greatest and most enduring satisfaction in life?" All through the generations of time these questions have addressed themselves to the thinking mind. The answers are transcendently important, because they mean so much to us here and hereafter. Christ knew the answer. He said: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." The poor in spirit are the seekers and finders of truth; they are those who are humble and whose minds are open to the light of truth; they are those who are spiritually dependent upon God and who approach Him in faith, asking Him to supply 405 Him in faith, asking Him to supply their needs. Poverty of spirit is the antithesis of pride, arrogance, self-righteousness, and self-conceit.
The answer to the question: "Who are the poor in spirit?" is found in the attitude of mind seeking for the kingdom of heaven.
The kingdom of heaven is not a straight jacket, and membership in it does not abridge one in the pursuit of anything that will contribute to permanent happiness. It does not inhibit anything that will contribute to his permanent good. It is the path, the only path, that can be pursued with safety and security. It is the best way of life, the source of the greatest hope, of highest happiness, of the greatest joy, of the most perfect hope, of the most enduring peace. It is the royal road into the celestial presence of God.
In this kingdom is found the plan worked out by infinite minds, before the world was framed or man appeared upon its surface, by which man can triumph over evil and opposition and secure the greatest joy to which he is heir. The object of the kingdom of heaven is to help, to save, to bless, and to exalt the children of God.
The passport into that kingdom is not a long face, but a contrite spirit; it is the desire to learn truth and the willingness to live according to the will of the Father.
Happiness does not consist in what we have, but rather in what we are. Miserable are the proud in spirit; happy are the poor in spirit. Literature
New Testament
Preview of Lessons for 1944-45
NO greater literature than that contained in the New Testament has ever been given to mankind. None has ever been more widely read and reread. No other literature has portrayed life more convincingly, nor expressed divine truth more impressively, more lastingly.
Through nearly a score of centuries this Book of Books has been a living light to the world. It has guided millions along the way of righteousness. It has inspired the creation of countless poems, songs, stories, dramas, paintings, sculpture, and other works of art. Its quickening, uplifting influence will be radiated through the ages yet to come.
Appreciation of the New Testament as inspiring Scripture, preserved in simple, yet artistic literary forms, is the central aim of this course. Lessons are planned to lead those who study them nearer to spirit and understanding to this living literature. For those who follow the work faithfully should come fuller enlightenment and a firm testimony of the Gospel.
Within the limits of the course, the time for study is short. The New Testament can receive attention. 406 By holding to the main purpose of the lessons?a study of the varied types of literature within the Sacred Volume?these valuable returns should come: first, a stimulating review, or new view, of stories and words of truth we cherish; second, enjoyment of masterpieces of spiritual literature; third, basic information that will help to add meaning and life to other great literature and art inspired by the New Testament. Naturally, it is hoped that more appreciative reading of this Book of Books, more sharing of its treasures between parents and children, will be other valued outcomes of the course. Eight study units, planned for 1944-45, briefly outlined, are as follows: 1.
