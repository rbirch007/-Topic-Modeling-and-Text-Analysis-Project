If you have had this experience, perhaps your mind wandered away from your own community out over the state furnished and equipped, and how are they kept? How do the people within them live? Mankind has always felt the call of home and made sacrifices for its maintenance, but homes today differ in many respects from those of other, periods of time. Modern science and invention have taken much of the work formerly done in the home into factories, and they household tasks easier to perform. The social life of the family has also been affected by industrial changes and by the many new types of recreation such as are provided by the radio and motion-picture. The ease of transportation has destroyed the isolation of farm and village homes, SO that today they are not so self-sufficient. The real spirit of the home, however, remains vital despite these changes, and must be safeguarded. The problem for us today is to adjust our homes and homelife to meet changes in out conditions caused by the war. This requires management efficient, capable household management. Great care must be exercised in all phases of homemaking and housekeeping. Furnishings, like everything else in the home, respond to intelligent care with longer life and more lasting beauty. Daily dusting of furniture is a desirable standard to maintain. Occasionally, furniture may be very thoroughly cleaned by wiping the 51 wood with a soft cloth, using luke warm water and any pure, neutral soap. Saturate the cloth in warm water, put a teaspoon OF two of melted soap in the damp cloth, fold the cloth to make a pad, and rub it overt the polished surface of the wood until it lathers and all finger prints and dirt are removed. 'Then dampen another cloth in tepid water and wipe the surface clean. Wipe dry with a soft, dry clean cloth, rubbing with the grain of the wood. A good furniture polish may then be ap plied. To remove the foggy appearance frequently found on highly polished woods, rub with the grain of the wood, using a clean piece of cheesecloth which has been dampened with a solution made of one quart clear water and one tablespoon vinegar. Spots, especially white water marks, can be removed with camphorated oil. A good furniture polish a envy of every one antiques Ot old pieces of furniture use a solution of two parts turpentine to one part of linseed oil, of equal parts of linseed oil, turpentine, and vinegar. Apply with a soft cloth and polish with a dry cloth. To clean crevices in carved pieces of furniture use a cotton-wrapped orange-wood stick or a wooden skewer. Painted furniture may be washed with a solution made by dissolving one-half cup neutral soap flakes in one quart water and stirring in one half cup whiting when cool. Hot, dry houses and apartments are apt to dry out woods, and frequently crack them. From forty to sixty per cent humidity in rooms is healthy for furniture. Don't place fine woods near hot radiators nor near open windows. All woods expand with moisture and therefore closely fitted furniture may stick if the atmosphere is damp. Be patient if drawers swell in damp weather. Wax or soap rubbed on the surface where friction occurs may end the trouble, but if this fails, it may be necessary to remedy the trouble by having an expert cabinet-maker plane the edges. There is a tinted wax which contains enough wood stain to cover surface scratches that is quite satisfactory to use when polishing slightly damaged furniture. It comes in mahogany, walnut, and light wood tints to match your furniture. Upholstered furniture should be thoroughly cleaned once a week with a stiff whisk broom or with a vacuum cleaner. However, do not use a vacuum on a cushion filled with down. Sometimes small spots on upholstered furniture may be removed with a cleaning fluid. Carbon tetrachloride is safe and good. On some fabrics clear water may be used. Spots come out more easily if they have not had time to gather dirt. Dirt left in the fabric will attract moths. To keep moths away, put moth crystals into the crevices and cover furniture with a sheet for two days. It is possible to wash upholstering made of tapestry, denim, rep, and many other fabrics if they are fast colors. First, clean as thoroughly as possible by brushing and using the vacuum cleaner, then make a stiff suds as follows: shave and dissolve one-half cake of any pure neutral soap (or one cup flakes) in one quart of boiling water. Mix a small amount of this solution with a little cold water and beat to a stiff dry froth. Using this suds, scrub about a ten-inch circle at a time, using a stiff brush and rubbing with a rotary motion. The material should not become soaked. Use a spatula to scrape off all the lather possible, and then wipe with a damp sponge. Scrubbing pile fabrics, like corduroy, velvet, and velours, will mat the surface, so brush these fabrics thoroughly when almost dry with a soft brush against the nap. Let the fabric dry thoroughly before using the furniture. Topics for Discussion 1, Give suggestions for cleaning furniture upholstered in leather or leatherette. 2.

LESSON DEPARTMENT 53 literature The Bible as Literature Lesson 7?Bible Oratory Tuesday, April 18, 1944 BEST examples of Bible oratory are to be found in Deuteronomy. This Master Book is made up, indeed, of a series of orations developed around a central theme?the Farewell of Moses. It is a volume unique ?blending history, oratory, and drama with impressive effect in a portrayal of a great leader giving messages of truth and light at his parting from a people he has freed from bondage, guided in upward development for forty years, and led to the edge of a Land of Promise. Stirring romance weaves into the life of Moses. Born in tragic times, he is hidden as a babe to escape death, is reared as an adopted son of a princess, with his own mother, as nurse, to train his heart. Outlawed because he strikes down a cruel Egyptian taskmaster, he flees into -the wilds. There, responding to the voice of God, he sets himself to his master work?the deliverance and development of his oppressed people. As an instrument in the hand of God, he brings the Israelites out from bondage. A pursuing army is ns in the depths of the Red ea. Work that tests Moses to the core follows. Facing the rigors of desert life, the liberated host falters. A longing for the "flesh pots of Egypt;" a return to the worship of idols must be corrected, and are sternly rebuked. Spies, sent to the Land of Promise, return with discouraging reports. It is filled, they say, with walled cities. Ten of the twelve spies protest against marching against them. Only Joshua and Caleb have courage to try to take the Promised Land. The majority of the people side with the ten fearful spies. Then comes God's decree that the Israelites shall wander in the wilderness for forty years. Why? Simply to let the coward blood die out while a new generation, born free, can be trained to take on the task of winning their heritage. Here is constructive work for Moses and his fellow leaders. Under God's inspiration and guidance, a theocratic government is set up for this nomadic people wandering over the desert. 'They are taught the laws of the Lord?drilled in religious practices. Miracles, such as a cloud to lead by day and a pillar of fire by night, help to keep them closer to God, more amenable to His leadership. Moses rises to mastery of the situation. Then, like many another leader, he inclines to rely on himself. A crisis comes. The people are without water. They cry to Moses, and he rises to their help as years before he had done at the Red Sea. This time he smites a rock in the desert, and water gushes forth to quench the thirst of the fainting horde. But Moses fails to praise God for the miracle and the deliverance, as he had done when the waters were parted. And for this failure, the great leader is sternly rebuked and punished. God's decree is that he shall not enter the Promised Land. Thus it happens that when Israel, organized as a militant nation, was ready to make conquest of the longed-for realm, Moses was permitted to see it only with his eyes, but saith the Lord unto him, 'Thou shalt not go over thither." Naturally, this parting of a revered leader from his people would be made an impressive occasion. Within Deuteronomy, as already said, we get a stirring record of the Farewell. History is recalled, basic laws of God reimpressed. It was this Master Book, rediscovered in later years during the reign of Josiah (see II Kings, Chaps. 22 and 23), that brought a vigorous reformation in the Kingdom of Judah, with a restoration of Mosaic Law in its primitive simplicity and strength. Deuteronomy is begun (Chaps. 1:5 to 4:41) with what might be called a historical oration. In it, Moses reviews outstanding events that occurred during the years in the wilderness, impressing their vital import as h e proceeds, and closing with these trenchant lines: Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders . . . according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God; there is none else beside him. Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee . . . And because he loved thy fathers, therefore, he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt. . . . Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments . . . that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days up-on the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever (Deut. 4:33 ff.). The second oration (Deut. 5) is addressed especially to the Levites? Keepers of the Law. In it, Moses re-impresses the Ten Commandments, saying: These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. . . . And ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth (Deut. 5:22 ff.). Following this, come lines kept precious through the ages by devout believers in the Mosaic Law: Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might (Deut. 6:4- 5 ).These watchwords, like thou SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME, express in essence the religion God gave to the world through Israel. They were, by divine command, to be kept in the heart, taught diligently to children, worn upon hand or forehead, written on doorpost LESSON DEPARTMENT or gate. The import of all this becomes clear as one remembers that those were days of many gods and of idol worship. Yet the command is just as vital in these days of distraction and temptation. In connection with the second oration, the Book of the Covenant, containing specific and basic laws, is given for guidance of priests and people. The third oration (Deut. Chap. 28), prefaced by a solemn ceremony: The Rehearsal of the Blessing and the Curse, is held by eminent critics to be one of the most powerful of all orations. Dr. Moulton ranked it as one of the three greatest in his 'appraisal, the other two being that of the Greek orator Demosthenes, On the Crown, and that of Edmund Burke, the English Statesman, Speech on Conciliation. Preceding the oration on The Blessing and the Curse, come specific instructions from Moses and the elders to the people. When they have crossed over Jordan into the land of their inheritance, they are to set up stones upon which are to be written the words of the law, and build an altar to God and offer sacrifices. 'Then with impressive ceremony, with the priests leading and the people responding, certain sinful practices are to be forbidden, under penalty of a curse. 'They shall make no graven nor molten image; they shall not set light by their fathers and mothers but honor them; they shall not remove a neighbor's landmark, nor make the blind to wander out of the way. (This probably implies spiritually as well as physically blind.) One after another various vital sins are to be specified with the 55 admonition that those committing them shall be accursed. And as each sin is given with its penalty, "all the people shall say, Amen." Following this comes the oration, beginning: And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God. Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store. Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. The Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways (Deut. 28:1-7). Then, after detailing with eloquent concreteness other blessings that shall reward righteousness, the speaker paints the other side of the picture. In keeping with the practice of those earliest times when folk were kept in line mainly through "fear of dire punishment, the oration depicts the various curses that disobedience will bring. A suggestion of its forceful language comes from these closing lines: And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people.... And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy feet have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart.... And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee.... In the moming thou shalt say, Would God it were even! And at even 56 thou shalt say, Would God it were morning.... And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships... And there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you (Deut. 28:64 ff.). The fourth oration (Chaps. 29 and 30) is more soothing in tone, filled with fatherly admonition for the people to make and keep covenant with the Lord, that they might merit His choice blessings. At its conclusion Moses says: I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the Lord hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy. These nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them.... And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; " and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.... He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed (Deut. 31: 2 ff.). Following this last oration, the great leader rises to poetic expression in praise of God: the opening lines (from Moulton's Modern Reader's Bible) are: Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of My Mouth: My doctrine shall drop as the rain, My speech shall distil as the dew; We ek oe For I will proclaim the name of the Lord: Ascribe ye greatness unto our God. The Rock, His work is perfect; For all His ways are judgment: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he. After this comes the dramatic Farewell. The twelve tribes take appointed stations on the slopes of Mount Nebo. Their great prophet and lawgiver passes them as he ascends the mountain, giving words of cheer and blessing. Finally, from the heights he is shown the Land of Promise. Then: So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-poer: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day (Deut. 34:5-6). Discussion and Activities _. Give five to ten outstanding events in the life of Moses that lead up to his Farewell as portrayed in Deuteronomy. Use just a sentence or phrase in making this summary, as?Moses is reared in the home of Pharaoh. Why was it necessary for him to bid farewell to his people near the Land of Promise to which he had led them? How did he turn his own sorrow into a blessing for them? 3. How many orations are contained in Deuteronomy? Suggest in a sentence or title the main message of each oration. 4. Why should the rediscovery of this great book during the reign of Josiah cause such a reformation among the people of Judah? What basic things does it present forcefully not alone for the Jews, but for all of us? 5. Be ready to quote some passage from Deuteronomy that has impressed you, for its force, its concrete picture of life, or some commandment it carries. Deuteronomy has: been spoken of as oratory in a dramatic setting. Explain. 7. What for you is especially impressive, perhaps touching, in the closing chapters of Deuteronomy? Note: Dr. Moulton's Modern Reader's Bible will be found especially helpful in the study of Deuteronomy, and the orations it contains. LESSON DEPARTMENT 57
