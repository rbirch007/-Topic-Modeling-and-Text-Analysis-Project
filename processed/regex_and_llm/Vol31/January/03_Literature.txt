M. At 12 noon all leaven was to be destroyed, either by immersing it in water, by burning it, or by scattering it to the wind. The tule laid down to make sure the leaven was destroyed was this: "They laid two desecrated cakes of a thankoffering on a bench in the porch (of the Temple). So long as they lay there, all the people might eat (leavened); when one of them was removed, they abstained from eating, but they did not burn (the leaven); when both were removed, all the people burnt (the leaven)." Early in the forenoon of the 14th all work ceased, except by barbers, tailors, and laundrymen. One can but ponder what the thoughts of Jesus were as He watched all this preparation for the sacrifice. Had He then the foresight of the preparation for His last supper, preceding His own crucifixion, such foresight as He had in the garden when He prayed: "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done."" Did He recall the day, generations before, that He gave commandment to Adam to offer sacrifice, when, under His direction, the angel told Adam the purpose of sacrifice: "This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth," Securing the Paschal Lamb The next step in the Passover ceremony, after the destruction of the leaven, was the securing of a proper lamb for the Feast, which under the Rabinical law must be not less than 79/ Luke 22: 42. 80/ Moses 5:7. "Sacrifice and Offerings," eight days nor more than exactly one year old. 'The lamb was to be without blemish, which excluded "the blind, the broken, the maimed, the ulcerous, the scurried, the scabbed, the bruised the crushed, and the castrated. All these defects are de-. Fined as blemishes." This lamb was to serve for a company of not less than ten nor more than twenty. As already indicated, Joseph and Mary and Jesus may have brought their lamb with them, but it must be remembered that the journey from Nazareth to Jerusalem, was a long one by foot?probably 75 miles as the road runs?and the driving or carrying of a lamb that distance would be a considerable burden. So they probably did, as did others coming from long distances, purchase their lamb either in the City itself or in the Temple market. It seems that, in strictness, the lamb should have been chosen on the loth of Nisan though this must have been changed by the time of the Savior, since it seems clear the Apostles purchased the lamb on the very day of the Paschal supper. Assuming that Jesus had not been in the Temple since He was a baby, it seems likely that Joseph would have taken Him along to the Temple, to see the carrying out of the rituals incident to the offering of the burnt sacrifice and of the Paschal lamb." While Joseph and Jesus journey towards the Temple in the early forenoon, we may review some of the essentials of the sacrificial service. 81 Zenos in Standard Bible Dictionary sub.

MY FATHER'S BUSINESS Essentials of the Sacrificial Service We shall not here enter into any consideration of the meanings and significance of sacrifices, which began with Adam whom the Lord commanded to "offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord." At first, the rituals connected with the offering of the sacrifice appear to have been fairly simple, but as the generations came, additions were made, and after the final destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem by Titus, which rendered its services impossible, "prayers, and fasts, etc." came in substitution of the rituals they could no longer carry out." As finally developed in the Temple, sacrifices were of four principal kinds: burnt offerings, sin offerings, trespass offerings, and peace offerings. The burnt offerings and the peace offerings were sacrifices of an existing communion with God, and might be accompanied by meat and drink offerings; while the sin offering and the trespass offering were to reestablish with God a communion which had been lost." 'The sin offering was an atonement for the individual in all his failings or misdoings, while the trespass offering atoned for some special transgression committed through ignorance. Every sacrifice offered must belong to him who offered it." The sacrifices were sometimes classified as "bloody" and "unbloody"; another classification was of sacrifices "due" and "undue"; they 7 were also classified as "public" (of which there were eleven) and "private" which latter were for sins by word or deed, those having to do with defilement of the body, those relating to festive seasons, and those on account of vows or promises. But the classification based on the Scripture was: "most holy" sacrifices (including all burnt, sin, and trespass offerings, all public peace offerings, and certain meat offerings) and "less holy" sacrifices which could be offered otherwise than at the Temple." There were three kinds of four-footed beasts that might be offered as sacrifices:" oxen, sheep, and goats, where there were differences as to ages and sex; and two kinds of birds: doves and pigeons, which were permitted as substitutions for other sacrifices in cases of extreme poverty; they were also used as sacrifices for certain purifications, no distinction being made as to sex or age, except that the pigeons must be young and the doves fully grown." Of the four-footed beasts, the Paschal lamb, and all trespass and burnt offerings must be males. The one offering the sacrifice must himself be purified." This accomplished, the procedure was as follows: First, there were five things which the offerer must himself do: lay his hands on the sacrifice, kill it, flay it, cut it up, and wash the inwards.* The other matters incident to the ritual at the altar, the priests did. 85/ Moses 5:5. 86/ The Temple, p. 80. 87/ ibid pp. 82, 99. 88/ ibid p. 105. 89/ ibid p. 83. 90/ The Temple pp. 85-86. 91/ Lev. 1:2; Moore in Encyclopedia Biblica sub voce "Sacrifice," ? 26. 92/The Temple p. 84. 93/I Sam. 16:5; Beard in Kitto, Cyclopedia Biblical Literature, sub voce "Offering."

Joseph and Jesus Come to the Temple Joseph and Jesus would come to the Temple over the Royal Tyropoeon Bridge, which was 354 feet long and 225 feet high at the deepest point." It crossed the valley of the same name, the Valley of Cheesemongers. It was the bridge over which, some twenty-one years later, Jesus was to be led bound as a common criminal "to and from the palace of the high priest, that of Herod, the meeting place of the Sanhedrin, and the judgment seat of Pilate." Jesus, as the first-born of the family, would be fasting." Joseph and Jesus would enter the Temple enclosure by the southwest gate and come immediately into the Court of the Gentiles, where were gathered together, for sale by the priests to the Paschal pilgrims, oxen, sheep, and doves in great number. The bleating of the sheep, the lowing of the oxen, the cooing of the doves must have greatly disturbed the ears of this quiet country Youth. And here, Jesus saw for the first time the money changers, taking their discount for exchanging the money of the visitors into the Temple coin." There would be hundreds of others crossing the bridge and entering the Temple as they did, and tens of thousands of other worshipers in the Court with them (for it is estimated the Temple enclosure might contain at one time 210,000 persons"'?this seems incredible) whose voices, mingling with the lowing of the cattle and bleating of the sheep must have made an indescribable confusion, to say nothing of the smells which must have come from this conglomerated gathering. Again the thought thrusts itself upon us?what could have been the Youth's thoughts as He came into all this? As He crossed the Royal Bridge, did He see the morning of His arraignments;" as He came in among the money changers, did He see how He cleansed the Temple of them, first at the beginning and again at the end of His public ministry? As Joseph had the Youth with him, he probably came in the early forenoon, to let Jesus leisurely view, as they came over the Tyropoeon Bridge, the splendid terraces of the Temple Mount, and then as they came into the Temple enclosure, the porches and courts of the Temple itself, all of white marble decorated with gold. To the Jews, Jerusalem was not only the most beautiful city in the world, but it was also a holy city. Three Elements of the Passover The Rabbis taught that three things. Were incident to the Passover: "presence," the "Chagigah," and "joyousness." The first, "presence," meant that every one who came to Jerusalem must offer a burnt offering on the 14th of Nisan, from animals which were "cholin," that is from animals that did not otherwise belong to the Lord as tithing, firstlings, or things devoted, etc. So for this reason, also, Joseph must come early, because the burnt offering must be offered before the evening sacrifice, which if 14th 95/ The Temple p. 20. 96/Op.

MY FATHER'S BUSINESS Nisan came on Sunday would be as early as 12:30 in the afternoon (or at 1:30 on days other than Sunday ) "in order that there would be time after it to attend to the slaughter of the tens of thousands of Paschal lambs for the worshipers. Furthermore, the '"Chagigah" were also sacrifices," one for Nisan 14 and the other for Nisan 15. These were peace offerings. The one for the 14th being a voluntary offering might come from the sacred things (as tithes of the flocks) and might form part of the Paschal supper if the Paschal lamb would not be enough for the company eating it. This sacrifice must also have been made before the regular daily evening Temple sacrifice. The "Chagigah" for Nisan 15 was obligatory and must therefore be made with an animal that was "cholin." The "joyousness" referred to the spirit with which the sacrifices were to be carried forward by the worshipers. Joseph's Burnt Offering Joseph, on coming into the Temple enclosure on this Passover morning, would first give his attention to the offering of the burnt offering he was required to make. As he was poor, he probably took a ram, at best, but if he intended to make it a part of the Paschal supper?"Chagigah"?he would probably choose a lamb. We will assume, however, that his offering was not intended to supplement the Passover supper and was not therefore "Chagigah" which was a peace offering. Having purified himself and having secured the sacrifice, he would take it (it being a "most holy" sacrifice and burnt offering) to the north gate of the Great Court, that is the Court of Israel, and the Court of the Priests, and take it through this gate into the Court itself" At this point it should be said that there are differences of opinion as to the exact location and size of the Court of Israel. Edersheim'" would make it a strip 164 feet wide along the east side only of the Court of the Priests, while Col. Watson would make it the same width on the east side of the Court of the Priests but would extend it also along the north and the south side of the Court of the Priests, with a width unknown.", Joseph would now turn the face of the sacrifice? to the west so as to face the Most Holy Place in the Temple, this being done to "bring it before the Lord." Then he would turn the ram so that he himself would face the west, looking toward the Most Holy Place. Thereupon he would lay his hands on the head of the ram? between its horns, and in this ceremony Jesus may have assisted. The hands were to be laid, apparently, with the offerer's whole weight. Then Joseph would offer the following prayer: "I entreat, O Jehovah: I have sinned. I have done perversely. I have rebelled. I have committed (naming the breach of positive or negative command); but I return in repentance, and let this be for my atonement (covering)."? 105/ The Temple p. 116; Moulton in Hasting's Bible Dictionary, sub voce "Passover." 106/The Temple p. 186. 107/I Sam. 16:5. 108/The Temple pp. 28, 30, 186. 109/The Temple p. 29. 110/ Palestine Exploration Fund, 1896, p. 47 ff. 111/ The Temple pp. 86-87. 112/ Lev. 1:4 ff; 3:2; 4:4. 113/The Temple p. 88. During the imposition of hands Joseph must either stand within the. Court of Israel, or must at least have his hands within the Court should he be standing either in the Nicanor Gate or on the steps leading from the Court of Israel to the Court of the Priests. Following the imposition ? of hands, Joseph would kill the ram,? being careful not to violate the detailed rules laid down by the Rabbis, the most important of which seems to have been that the gullet must never be wholly severed."* Whether this act of slaying was done inside the Priests' Court at the north of the altar, or outside the Priests' Court in the Court of Israel just north of the altar is not wholly clear, because one rule provided that none but priests might go into the Court of the Priests, and another that sacrifices should be slain in the Court of the Priests just north of the altar. Another rule seems to have been that an "inconsiderable" offering might be slain "at any part of the outer court." It would seem, however, that the rule was that "only priests were allowed access here (Court of Priests), except when a layman might appear bringing his offering," which would permit the offerer to slay and dress the sacrifice in the Court of the Priests. Seemingly this was the manner followed. The Altar of Burnt Sacrifice We might note here that the altar, which was in the Court of the Priests (just in front of the entrance to the Temple) was square and made of unhewn stones "taken from virgin soil, that had not been defiled by any tool of iron." 'The altar was in three "sections," one atop the other, the second smaller than the first, and the third than the second." The base was 32 cubits square (48 feet) the next above being 28 cubits square (42 feet), and the top 24 cubits square (36 feet). The altar was about 15 feet high. The top "circuit" (the shelf between the second and top sections) was 6 feet wide and 3 feet from the top of the altar, and 41% feet from the top of the "horns" at each corner of the altar. It was on this "circuit" ?shelf?that the priests walked in attending to the sacrificial rites. An inclined plane on the south of the altar led from the pavement to this "circuit." There were three fires on top of the altar: one on the east for the offerings; one on the south for the incense; and one on the north from which the other two were kindled. About midway up the side of the altar and running all around it was a red line. The blood of the sacrifices to be partly eaten was sprinkled above the red line; the blood of those to be wholly consumed was to be sprinkled or thrown below the ted line. Nearby was a heap of salt from which was taken the salt with which every sacrifice must be salted." On the north side of the great altar "were rings in the pavement, for tying the victims, posts supporting beams with hooks to hang them up on, and low marble tables for dressing the large cattle." 114/ The Temple p. 87. 115/ Lev. 1:5, 11. 116/ The Temple p. 89. 117/ Kitto op. Cit. 118/ Zenos, sub voce "Temple"; Ex. 29; The Temple p. 40; Lev. 1:5, 11. 119/ The Temple pp 32, 131. 120/A cubit is given as 18 inches or 17.7 inches. Palestine, 1896, p- 50; The Temple p. 131. 121/ The Temple pp. 32, 33, 133. 122/ Moore, op. Cit.  MY FATHER'S BUSINESS The Killing and Burning of the Sacrifice As Joseph killed the ram on the north side of the altar, a priest caught the blood in a golden bowl, and standing on the east side of the altar, he threw some of the blood on the angle of the altar at the northeast corner, so that it would go on both the east and the north sides of the altar; he would then go to the angle on the southwest corner and throw some more of the blood there so that it would go on the south and west sides of the altar; the blood that was left he would pour out at the base of the altar." This was the first of the priestly functions in the actual offerings of a private sacrifice. The other priestly functions were: lighting the altar fire, laying on the wood, bringing up the pieces of the sacrifice, laying them on the fire, and then doing thereafter the remainder of the rites incident to the sacrifice. Meanwhile, Joseph had hung the ram on one of the hooks provided therefore in the Court of the Priests; he was both to skin it and to cut it up into pieces according to strict and detailed instructions. The pieces were then handed to six priests who carried them "to the rise of the altar," where they were salted and laid down." 'These priests then handed to another priest, who had gone up to the "circuit" just below the top of the altar, the sacrifice piece by piece, which this priest, after pressing each piece with his hands, first threw upon the altar "confusedly," and then arranged them on the fire 123/ The Temple pp. 100, 113; Moore, op. Cit. 124/ The Temple p. 86. Temple pp. 35, 135, 141; Moore, op. Cit. Moore, op. Cit. 11 in an order to represent as nearly as possible the natural shape of the animal. Joseph had also taken away the "sinew of the thigh" (which was neither eaten nor sacrificed), and the entrails, which latter were washed, dried with a sponge, and then turned over to the priests to be salted and burned, the whole sactrifice being burned. The skins of the burnt offerings belonged to the priests who sold them at considerable profit. While the point is not clear on the authorities, yet it would seem that the private burnt offering would be completed, for the offerer, with the final arranging of the sacrifice on the altar, without the ceremonies incident to the burning of the incense and, the presentation of the meat and drink offerings incident to the rites of the public burnt offering. But if these subsequent ceremonies were added to the private burnt offering their character will be clear from the description of the evening sacrifice now following. The Meat and Drink Offering As already stated, Joseph would probably offer also a meat and a drink offering, along with the burnt offering. The law controlling this matter reads as follows: Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil. And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a 125/ The 126/ Gen. 32:32; The Temple pp. Go, 100; meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil. And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the Lord. And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the Lord: Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil. And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. Edersheim thus describes the making of a meat offering: When presenting a meat-offering, the priest first brought it in the golden or silver dish in which it had been prepared,, and then transferred it to a holy vessel, putting oil and frankincense upon it. Taking his stand at the south-eastern corner of the altar, he next took the "handful" that was actually to be burnt, put it in another vessel, laid some of the frankincense on it, carried it to the top of the altar, salted it, and then placed it on the fire. The rest of the meat-offering belonged to the 127/ Numbers 15:4-11. 128/ The Temple p. 110. Priests. Every meat-offering was accompanied by a drink-offering of wine, which was poured at the base of the altar. Joseph and Jesus having now finished the burnt offering required, would, pending the time for the of. Fering of the regular public evening sacrifice (which at Passover would begin as early as 12:30 P. M.)," probably saunter about the Temple Courts, viewing the beauties thereof and their magnificence. However, they would most likely keep, as near as might be, to the entrance to the Great Court: first, in order to get as Close a view as possible of the ceremonies of the evening _ sacrifice, which would precede the offering of the Passover lamb; and next, to be sure to be in the first division for the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb, which would enable them to leave the Temple earlier and get to the place where they would eat the Passover. This would be especially desirable if they were stopping at Bethany or, if still farther away, at Bethlehem. (To be continued) 129/ ibid p. 190. Oe GIVE US FAITH | Olive C.
