Notes from the Field" appear in the Magazine for June 1942, page 420. INTERESTING LOCAL RELIEF SOCIETIES Woodruff Stake (Wyoming) ESTHER WARBURTON, president of the Woodruff Stake Relief Society, sent the following interesting information concerning the new Relief Society organized October 10 at Aspen Tunnel, Wyoming, with Miranda Snow Walton as president: "A section boss has given them an old box car to use for their meetings; it has a stove. They are going to clean the car, provide a play box for the children to use in the little kitchen, as all the members with the exception of one have two or more small children. Every member gave a donation which provided enough to purchase a songbook. They hope to get an old discarded organ. They are going to have a chili supper and in this way raise money for their little needs in Relief Society. We are very happy for them and are hoping, as a stake board, to be able to visit them once this winter. We will have to go on the train and stay all night, as in winter all roads to them are closed." Moroni Stake (Utah) SADA D. RASMUSSEN, president of Fountain Green Ward Relief Page 38 Society recently reported: "Fountain Green Ward has a Relief Society membership of 161. This ward held a fair September 24, 1943. Every ward member was asked to furnish something for this fait?anything which could be sold. We received a great variety of finished articles, such as aprons, baby clothing, play suits, handwork, vegetables, eggs, and honey. We also sold lunches, ice cream, cakes, pies, and candy. Other groups of the ward sponsored side shows, a children's dance in the afternoon, and an evening entertainment and dance for the public. After expenses were paid we had enough money to buy three $100 war bonds, one $50 bond, and one $25 bond, and have since received funds toward another bond. After the war, these bonds will be turned in toward our new ward chapel. Western States Mission LUCEAL R. CURTIS, president of Relief Societies in the Western States Mission, submitted, during 1942, pictures of several of the more than fifty local Relief Societies in this mission. Since that time some changes have doubtless occurred in the personnel of the officers and members of these Relief Societies, and the achievements during 1943 may have exceeded the accomplishments of the year 1942. EIGHT LIVING PRESIDENTS OF THE RELIEF SOCIETY OF THE MEADOW WARD, MILLARD STAKE, UTAH This ward Relief Society was organized in 1870 with Martha Bennett as president, who served with devotion for 27 years. Since that time eight other presidents, all of whom are still living in Meadow, have served faithfully in this calling. They are in order of their presidency: top row from left to right: Elizabeth Stewart with 8 years of service, Elizabeth Bushnell 17 years, Emmeline Beckstrand 5 years, Mary S. Beckstrand 1 year. Bottom row, from right to left: Mary A. Beckstrand 2 years, Albertina B. Fisher 5 years, Ida F. Stott 5 years, and Virginia Beckstrand, the present leader, 4 years. This picture was submitted by former president, Ida Stott. Nevertheless, these pictures, which could not be included in an earlier issue of the Magazine, are presented now in recognition of the excellent Relief Society work being carried forward in this mission, both by branches whose pictures appear herewith and by the many additional branches not pictured. Typical of the spirit of Relief Society work in this mission and elsewhere is the following statement by Sister Curtis: "The organization that has shown the greatest growth is Colorado Springs. Last fall, 1941, they were discouraged with often only two in attendance at their meetings. Then they caught the vision of Relief Society, and since that time they have every Latter-day Saint woman in Colorado Springs actively engaged in Relief Society work. They are so happy in their work that the whole branch has progressed, so much so that the little group of Saints who used to gather has since been organized into a branch."

Jensen, president, with Keith and Kent Layton; Mrs. Estelle Crowther, 2nd counselor, with Ardith and Arnold Mortensen. Two pairs of the twins are "centennial babies," born during 1942, the Relief Society Centennial year. In addition, the chorister, Ellen Smith, and the organist, Marba White (another daughter of the president), became mothers of beautiful baby daughters within a few days of the centennial date, all of which prevented the bigger celebration which had been planned. This ward has completed its building project, and the Society is well housed with a room for assembly and another for work.

Look up and put your trust in God? "Twill help to bear Your cross?and if your faith in Him Is strong and true, If you hold fast the iron rod He'll comfort you.
