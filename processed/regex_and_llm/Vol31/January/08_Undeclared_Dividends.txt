Undeclared Dividends Dr. M. Lynn Bennion ' Supervisor of Church Seminaries ODAY, thousands of Church T members are sticking devotedly to their teaching assignments despite the extra calls made upon their time and energy by the war program. Why are these men and women willing to consecrate a definite share of their energy, time, and best thinking to Church teaching? Because teaching is worth it. Great dividends are received, not in cash, but in the intangible blessings which increasingly come to those who teach. Everybody enjoys sitting under the spell of a successful teacher. He knows his subject thoroughly, his methods are effective, and his personality radiates confidence and good will. Granting that he has certain inborn qualities that contribute to his success, how else can we account for his power? In the first place, we may be quite sure he has developed the habit of growth. Such growth did not just happen. It is the result of conscious striving to master a complex undertaking. The teacher may seem at ease but he is not doing easy routine work. Back of it are many hours of careful preparation. His reading has become regular, systematic, and sequential. His insight into the significance of his task spurs him on to unstinted exertions in order to achieve his purpose. Growth in capacity to teach effectively is the natural result. Not only is the teacher growing but his "growing edge" is in contact with those he seeks to teach. 'There are many fairly competent teachers who no longer deeply influence people because they teach with routine skill matters which have ceased to be, for them, at the "growing edge" of their own lives. That which is taught must be not just an extra or a side issue, but an opening door to discovery and rediscovery?a force at work revitalizing the teacher's own approach to living. In other words, there may be rather expert routine teaching which, having had its creative day, now gives a low spiritual voltage and precious little life-stirring value. The teacher's understanding of the Gospel is greatly reinforced through his efforts to give it to others. His creative powers are enhanced through his attempt to draw out his students in effective self-expression. Some of the fundamental age-old truths may not seem pertinent to present on-going experiences. To them, the teacher must bring touches of vividness that give them new force. He must be ingenious in discovering fresh ways of reanimating the familiar, speaking in parables that live rather than in abstractions that perish. In other words, he must exert his creative powers in order to bring appropriate originality to his lessons. Interest is always provoked by saying the right thing in unexpectedly appropriate ways. This growth we are speaking of is not just an adding to of knowledge Page 23 24 - or experience, but a continual reintegration of life at a high level. It is something of what Jesus had in mind when He spoke of becoming as a little child. He said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit," meaning the humble, open-minded, and _ teachable. Lincoln's biographer puts the same thought into the great line: "As elemental at his death as he was ancient at his birth." THE successful teacher in the Church is guided by the Holy Spirit. Here is an immeasurably tich dividend for the teacher, Without that guidance, his efforts would be ineffective. There are some who feel that self-effort hinders the flow of the Spirit. They suggest that religion is taught by simple contagion and there is little need of exerting one's own capacities in teaching. This statement is true in what it affirms and false in what it denies, Religion is caught, but it is untrue that catching and teaching have no relation to one another. We are, in all our labors, dependent upon the Holy Spirit; but it does not follow that the Holy Spirit has no need of our efforts. The guidance of the Spirit comes not by passive submission but by a consecration of work, of human abilities that are able, as well as willing, to be guided and taught by the Holy Spirit. In other words, this cherished guidance is not an arbitrary accident, a gift of fortune which knows no law and cannot be affected by conscious self-effort. "Seek and ye shall find"; "Knock and it shall be opened unto you." The friendship, confidence, and love of students are among the enduring satisfactions of being a teacher. These spiritual bonds often ripen with the years and bring ever-renewing joys to teacher and student. Eyery time the teacher learns about the success of a former student, he experiences. A glow of immeasurable pride and satisfaction. When a student gives him credit for his success in life, his joy is unbounded. The writer is tempted at this point to relate a few of the soul-satisfying experiences that have grown out of his Classroom teaching. They are like fragrant flowers making sweet and beautiful a path that might otherwise be discouraging. In the interest of conserving space, let us consider, rather, some elements that may help teachers to affect constructively the lives of people. The real teacher must learn to care deeply for each student and take a personal interest in him as an individual. This is not only true of the bright, attractive student but particularly so of the less gifted. We must like them regardless of personal peculiarities or mental slowness. The teacher must ever seek to discover what the spiritual needs of individuals are. Since every human personality is unique, this will always call for searching and creative insight, if human lives are to be constructively guided. This makes teaching a challenging art with ever-changing fascinations. Teaching that touches human life is never, therefore, merely a transfer of stereotyped subject matter. Subject matter is, in fact, but a means to meet effectively human ends. Having studied the students' problems the teacher makes available to them the resources of religion. A very pertinent illustration of what is UNDECLARED DIVIDENDS meant is to be found in the Book of Acts which recounts Philip's conversion of the Ethiopian treasurer. Philip "began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him...." (Acts 8:36). Philip began at the very point at which the other man had arrived in his experience and gave him the light he needed. Here is an early incident of life-situation teaching. It is bringing your teaching to the place of particular experience and need. It is in the failure to meet this need of the immediate situation that much of our teaching is lacking. An athletic coach once said to a student practicing the broad jump, "You go back so far for your run that you are all tired out when you come to the place to jump." A teacher who goes back to a review of Church history as a prelude to his lesson runs back so far that the class is all tired out when it comes to the place to jump. Often there is no time for the teacher to jump. Frequently the class is so far gone that it does not notice whether he jumped or not. One great teacher described his efforts to discover the needs of his pupils as follows: "It is my custom to spend much time here in my classroom alone. I walk up and down the aisles. I sit at my desk drinking in God's light through the window. I imagine the different individuals in the seats, seek an intimate compre hension of each one's needs, and pray for the power to meet these needs in a sane, intelligent. Inspired way. From my classroom I go to the street that passes the school, and see the people passing; bright faces and sad faces. There they go: unhappy faces on which are written doubt, scorn, Name. 25 and yearning, and a thousand evi-_ dences of a lack of integration with life and the universe. All the faces reveal a hunger for reality. I reach out to all of them." T this point, a warning is appropriate of one pitfall in this effort to bring the resources of religion to the point of practical need. It is the delusion that personal needs can be completely met or best met by what is often called "practical teaching." Your teaching may be so practical that it does not rise six feet above the ground. Many teachers have learned from humiliating experiences that common sense cannot do the energizing, creative work of religion. "Says Life to Art, 'I love thee best not when I find in thee my very face and form expressed with dull fidelity, but when in thee my longing eyes behold continually the mystery of my memory, and all I crave to be.' " It is very easy for teaching to be too practical to have any practical results. It can be too psychological to effect any psychological transformation. Too much on the level of daily life to perform the miracle of a lift to a new level of power. This truth is very effectively expressed in a passage in E. C. Raven's Autobiography, in which he tells of his disappointment in his boyhood days over the religious teaching which was so watered down to the supposed level of a boy's mind, that it left out a deep religious challenge and became. A dead thing. He says, "I do not, think that Jesus ever came into our ~ view, or that God was more than a " After describing the secular and ethical nature of his religious It can be 3 teaching he says, "And, dear God, how some of us wanted You." These last words echo in many lives today. People want and need, above everything else, to be brought in touch with God. In other words, teaching, to be practical and helpful, must be in a very vital sense, religious teaching. This does not mean that it should be a mete repetition of theological terms, but it must bring into life powers which have their fountain source in God. The great Teacher, on the hills of Galilee, always put first in His lesson, "Our Father." The Savior knew of the trials and hardships which would come to His disciples. "Ye shall stand before governors and kings." But He also knew that if they did not know God, and have faith in God, they would: not be able to face the tribulations ahead of them. The need of God in present-day living has been sharpened and accentuated by the confusion and disorder of our times, and the teacher of religion must do all in his power to make God a reality in the lives of individuals if he is to meet their most urgent and fundamental needs. It is hard to keep clear the sense of the deep meaning in life unless it is put in a cosmic frame. That is just what Jesus did, and that is what Gospel teaching today does?it puts life in an eternal frame with God at the center. The teacher who can give such a picture and such a conviction to students heightens and deepens for them the meaning of every experience of their lives. What greater compensation in this world can come than to be able to open the eyes of people to the true meaning and purpose of life? The absence or lack of such an outlook or perspective about life is the major cause of the present breakdown of our civilization. How urgent, then, is the need of teaching the Gospel of Christ, and how rich the opportunity and compensation involved! There is a striking sentence of wide application in a novel, published in 1935, called "Shoulder The Sky" by James Gray. The story deals with the emotional adjustment of two young married people, sensitive and sophisticated, much given to the habit of analyzing each other. The frail bark of their marriage struck a rock and sank. As they were parting, there was the inevitable post mortem, in the course of which the husband said, "Our shared doubts have been the only thing we had in common. They were not enough." Shared doubts are never enough for a foundation for living, but shared doubts are a large part of the spiritual capital of the children of this age. Alfred Noyes, the poet, puts his finger on the same lack of a positive faith. "Our literature, our art, our politics are impoverished by the lack of a fundamental faith that would enable us to face life with confidence and to feel, as our fathers felt, the thrill of a great purpose." NY teacher who attempts to develop and enrich the life of students is constantly challenged to demonstrate in his own life the qualities he would have his students attain. Teaching provides the best possible anchorage in life. It brings an increased feeling of accountability for one's acts in public and private. It assures greater resistance to temptation. As one young Sunday School  UNDECLARED DIVIDENDS teacher expressed it, "My teaching responsibility has kept me from succumbing to many temptations and for this I am most grateful." If this young teacher continues faithfully in his teaching work, greater compensations await him. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for those that love Him." His efforts to make God live in the minds and hearts of his students will cause his own life to be centered in Him. He will become consciously aware of God. Such an awareness immediately enriches experience, enhances enthusiasm about living and the enjoyment of life. Life then speaks louder than words to students concerning the teacher's convictions about God. It is of immeasurable help to a 27 baffled student to sit down beside a teacher who has faced what needs to be faced, who has found life good, who has achieved within himself a creative faith, and through the goodness of his own life has the power to reflect the love of God. We have suggested as undeclared dividends of teaching in the Church: growth in capacity to teach, the guidance of the Holy Spirit, discipleship through meeting effectively the needs of people. Finally, we have declared that an understanding of God and faith in God is the greatest need of human beings today. Those who understand the significance of the work or who have experienced its imperishable rewards will never lightly set aside a Church-teaching appointment, nor will they accept it without wholehearted commitment to its obligations and opportunities.
