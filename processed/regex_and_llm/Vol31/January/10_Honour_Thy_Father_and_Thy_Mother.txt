Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" (Exodus 20:12). 'To this law another promise is attached as given in Deuteronomy 5:16 which states: "that it might go well with thee." Christ, during His ministry, upheld this law and rebuked the Jews who followed tradition to the neglect of rendering obedience to the law as announced by Moses (Matt. 19:19). He also included this law among those which the rich young man must follow if he would gain eternal life. This vital commandment was also recognized by Paul who said, "But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel" (I Tim. 5:8). Yet in spite of these teachings, there are many who do not live this law. How often does one hear a mother say, "I took care of seven Page 30 (or five or three), but seven cannot take care of me." This is a terrible indictment of the selfishness of children in this day. A father and a mother spend the most active years of their lives in cherishing, guarding, and providing for their children, and from this devotion they receive in return their greatest joy and satisfaction. When these parents themselves may require loving tenderness, sympathy, help, and often financial support, it should be the joy of the children to furnish any and every assistance to them. True, this may entail long hours, months, or even years of nursing; it may require giving up many of the passing pleasures of each day; it may necessitate, even, a partial disruption of one's own family's life; in short, it may mean subordinating one's own desires to care for the needs and desires of another. But what better thing could one do to experience great satisfaction and lasting joy than to lovingly care for those to whom one owes his very existence upon this earth? Then, when one's parents have passed to the Great Beyond there will be no canker of remorse to gnaw the soul over what one might have done but neglected to do?neglected until it was forever too late. And add to the law "Honour thy father and thy mother" another law, "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you," and the great truth, "As ye sow so shall ye reap." M.C.S.

Tomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd CHAPTER X Synopsis: At the river?where Janet has taken Dr. Groneman on a last trip over the country before his return to New York?she has a_ terrifying experience which involves Juanee's twins. But again her fears are not confirmed although she realizes they are still deep rooted. From the river they go to the San Juan Goosenecks. Here, in describing a sunset of unusual splendor, she comes to realize the spiritual grandeur of the scene.... Five years elapse ?years filled with drought, loneliness, and dread, interspersed with pleasurable visits from the Newsbaums, Janet's sister and her husband. While on their latest visit, Paul is injured during a stampede. AUL and Doctor Potsworth sat in the patio berating each other and the weather. Paul's right leg, still in its cast, was comfortably propped up on a bench. "But for a mindful Providence and a convenient boulder, I'd still be headin' that stampede," he commented pleasantly. "Possibly in Heaven." "And I'd be about my business instead of playing nursemaid to you. I wish this blasted heat would shove along and make room for a breeze!" Janet came out to the patio with cookies and a cool drink. "How are the cactus twins?" the doctor asked. "Juanee has taken them to town. Joe drives his new car expertly. Paul says he's a wonder at it. But just the same I'll be glad when they are home under my wing again." "Here are the other twins," Paul laughed. "They'll console you." Tugi-Chee and Maneto rode pellmell into the yard heading for the river to swim, they announced loudly. "Joe should be firm about that river," Potsworth commented. "It's certainly not safe." Janet filled her hands with cookies to give them and went to the steps. "Tugi-Chee," she said to the dark-eyed boy on the nearest horse, "Don't go to the river while the water is so low. Mr. Paul has warned you that it's too shallow for diving." Tugi-Chee looked at her in surprise but Janet continued earnestly: "Many moons have passed since there was rain, Tugi-Chee. Don't go." Turning to the other boy, she renewed her plea: "Say you'll not go today, Maneto." "The grandsons of Chief Dodge are not afraid," Maneto said proudly. "Our mother not weep when we get hurt," Tugi-Chee scorned. "Do you want to stay, my brother?" "Do'ta!" Maneto's denial was emphatic. "Since we were five we have been diving five times higher than our own heads!" How well Janet remembered standing by the river with Dr. Groneman and seeing two little naked boys dive like bullets into its muddy depth. Though she had done much to overcome the fear she had felt for other things in the country, she still harbored a deep distrust of the river. "What would you do if anything Page 33 happened and you couldn't come to the top?" she asked. "We do not dive together," TugiChee said. 'Always Maneto dives first. I count. If he is too long I dive downstream after him." Maneto said: "When Tugi-Chee dives he always comes up. He is strong like my father. I am the swift one in the race." "But you'll stay home this time?" Janet coaxed. "Do'ta," Maneto said. His manner was respectful but unyielding. "No!" 'Tugi-Chee echoed, and turning, they galloped at a wild pace over the ridge and out of sight. Puss before sundown, Juanee came running from her hogan, quite unlike herself with importance and worry. "My father, Chief Dodge, sends for his grandsons and they are not here. They are to be taught the dance for rain," she said excitedly. Janet looked her surprise but said nothing. Juanee's eyes begged for understanding: "Many moons the earth has thirsted," she cried. "My people will bring the rains." The conflict between her white teaching and her traditional faith was never more in evidence. "That is good." Janet assured her. "We pray for rain, too. Have the boys gone to their grandfather?" "Too long they have been at the river!" Juanee exclaimed. "My father will be offended if they are not soon at his hogan." "We'll go for them in the car," Janet answered. "Myrrup can stay with Jerry and Paulette." They drove as fast as the wind-pocked roads would let them. Juanee was plainly anxious; she looked often at the setting sun. "T hope we don't miss them," Janet said, as she swung the car around the turn at the head of the dugway. It was her first trip to the river since that day five years ago when she had watched in terror while the water broke over two bronzed little bodies that swam proudly ashore. Nothing had changed since then. A thousand years could pass over this slow-moving river without denting one of its solid ledges. 'Time had surely stood still! The same "Hello-o-o-" was echoing along the walls. Nothing had changed but the place from which the call was coming.... Now the boys were on the bridge, much higher above the river than five times their own height, and Juanee was calling angrily: "Tugi-Chee, you bad one! Maneto, you come! For diving there is not time!" Fascinated, wholly without volition, almost as if she were under Dr. Groneman's insistent orders still, Janet raised her arms and waved. "We see you, Maneto," she cried. Maneto waved joyously, stretched his brown young arms out over the river and dived like a young hawk to its prey?straight into the dark depth forty feet below. Tugi-Chee stood with folded arms, waiting. "Ethii, noki, ta, tee, ostha," Janet counted, knowing that be 'Chee was counting, too. "Usti. Maneto's head did not appear. "Sey. En, eight?" Tugi-Chee had turned. He was gone?across the bridge to the downstream side. "Ten-n-n," Janet swallowed hard. Juanee's eyes had never left the spot in the river where Maneto had disappeared. Her body swayed. Not. A  TOMORROW'S CUP sound escaped her. Tugi-Chee dived. "Dear Lord," Janet prayed. "Break the water above their heads." _ Tugi-Chee had dived on the down: stream side of the bridge. He came up, holding Maneto's inert head above the water. Janet cried out: "Tugi-Chee! Tugi-Chee!" But her elation was brief, for a sudden current had pulled the boys under again. "Ethli, noki, ta, tee -- " she could count no more. Juanee had begun the death song, rocking. Rocking to the weird, beautiful wailing song of the Navajo. Janet could only wait, praying. And the river was calm. It seemed to Janet that her own life was flowing out with the river. Juanee's twins were dead. No.... There was Tugi-Chee... Clutching Maneto. But the current was bearing them downward! TugiChee would miss the only landing point above the rapids! Janet could hear the water roar, exultant, triumphant, sucking down and down into the rocks below. As if loosed by a spring, fear engulfed her. Wild unreasoning fear. 'She ran along the ledge. Further and further down the San -Juan dropped?dropped towards the rapids. She screamed: "Maneto! Ethli, noki....." It was no use! She sank to her knees, crying softly. Suddenly the river was calm; the current had subsided. Janet leaned over the bank. There?on a sand bar that had not been there before? lay the Navajo twins, tossed up from the cold, gray current into the sun. As she watched, Tugi-Chee pulled himself to his knees and laid his ear against his brother's heart. He shook the water from his black hair, stood 35 a moment, then taking Maneto in his arms again, he waded ashore. Janet rose. The sand bar and the only landing above the rapids had merged into one. Tugi-Chee would take Maneto to his mother. Maneto was dead. Janet stood on the ledge above the river, the sun streaming its last rays over her chilled body, and knew that the river had been kind. No little boys were clutched to its cold bosom. Benign and undisturbed, the San Juan bore on to its destination?west into the setting sun, and Janet was no longer afraid.... Had not death come proudly to Maneto? Come when there was a smile on his red lips, a triumphant cry in his heart? At the bridge, Tugi-Chee stood with folded arms beside his mother, tears washing his face like rain. Juanee's song was softly tender, infinitely sweet. A moment, and TugiChee was singing, too.... A strange peace came over Janet. A peace that only she could understand. THE RIVER HAD BEEN KIND. Maneto?the swift one?had gone on before. TugiChee?the strong one?would comfort Juanee. Paul saw them coming?Janet driving the car, slowly, Tugi-Chee leading Maneto's horse, his own reins slack upon his horse's neck. "Tl go into the desert for his father," Dr. Potsworth said after a hasty examination, and looked away from the grief in Juanee's eyes. "Tt is well," Juanee assented. TugiChee had not stopped singing. At the door of his father's hogan, he slid from his horse and followed his mother inside. That night the rains fell.... Life came back to the desert. OR October, the desert air was unusually chill; but to the four men in the patio at El Toro, it was merely bracing. Paul Morgan, Warren Newsbaum, Doctor Potsworth, and Dr. Mark Groneman, dim figures in the shadows that fell across the floor from the cliff, talked over old times. On a cushion in front of them so he could see the features of each one sat Jerry Morgan, knees hunched comfortably under his folded arms. Paul showed scarcely a year's added age, though ten had gone by! How proud Jerry was of him. His father. Always at school the last and first thought of every day had concerned FE] Toro. EI! Toro typified his father ? unchanging, _ secure, steadfast against life. White yuccas blooming all about the place! They were like his mother?lovely, serene. They filled his dreams.... Dr. Potsworth?almost like a grandfather. Dr. Groneman?a little strange in his blind efficiency?Paulette's pet enthusiasm. And last of all Uncle Warren?affectionately rough, generous, as loyal to San Juan as he himself or as his father. It was good to be home again. Inside, Janet and her sister, Rhae Newsbaum, sat before the fire absorbed in what sixteen-year-old Paulette Morgan was saying. "It's been a wonderful year, Mother," Paulette confided, studying the fire with grown-up wisdom in her eyes. "Dr. Groneman is the most wonderful man in New York, Aunt Rhae. Mother, that's not just my opinion!" she defended, seeing the amused smile in her mother's eyes. "Everyone says he is. The papers are full of reviews about his books. They say the world is indebted to him...." her voice trailed off dreamily. "And he writes things that are not scientific, too. Things that are?well?sort of elusive. Like that one he calls "The White Moth." It makes me think of you, Mother. I don't know why, but it does." "Being his protegee has done wonders for you, Paulette," Janet said, and there was a tremor in her voice that Paulette couldn't understand. "Except for Jerry, Father, Uncle Warren, and Doctor Potsworth, there's no man in the world I like better!" she stated. "Then your mother has nothing to worry about," Rhae Newsbaum laughed openly at Paulette. "Just you keep on liking those four men the best for four more years!" "Tl always like him in a very special way. He needs me, Aunt Rhae. His sister is a wonderful person, but not cheerful enough. He needs some one to?to understand him!" Janet laughed gaily. Paulette, piqued for a minute, jumped up and hugged her mother impulsively. "Do you know what, Mother? He says I'm to grow up like you?worthy of El Toro!" Janet's eyes shone. "That's a very great compliment," she said. "Ts it? I thought it rather strange. El Toro's not a very pretentious place. It's just something you love and want to come back to." "And what more could be said of any place," Rhae Newsbaum said. Janet looked at her sister in surprise. "Rhae, I didn't know you were sentimental about the place!" "It's fun to keep Paul defending it so hotly all the time; but I'm really  TOMORROW'S CUP for it. Now, Paulette?Don't you go and spoil everything by telling him that!" But though she was interested in their banter, Paulette was not to be turned from her theme. She smoothed her mother's hair, twisted a curl here, put a pin there, and resumed her subject. "There's something else he said, Mother.. I don't get it. He says only those who can see the blossoms and not the spikes, are worthy of El Toro. He's sort of queer about this place, do you know that?" Janet reached up and caught her daughter's hand. "Darling, we all are!" she said softly. "Have you always been, Mother? You used to make me afraid sometimes." Janet patted Paulette's hand; she looked into the fire, weighing her thoughts before she spoke. Then she said: "It took a husband; two very wise doctors and two pairs of twins to make me love El Toro." Then softly, almost under her breath, she added: "And the death of a little Indian boy to make me love San Juan." "Maneto." Paulette's voice was dreamy. "Yes, I remember him. He used to bring me flints and pretty rocks. Jerry liked Tugi-Chee the best." "Where is Jerry?" Janet asked. "He ought to be in, out of the cold." "He says he's going cave-dweller tomorrow. Can you beat that? With all the fun-things there are to do on the ranch, he goes off browsing around in dusty old ruins!" Janet and Rhae exchanged looks of understanding. "He has a grandfather to thank for that," Rhae said. "Our father loved this country, 37 Paulette," Janet added. "He came here every year until his health failed. Your father contributed a fine mummy collection to the museum where my father was curator. Jerry could well be like them." "It's too musty, fusty, dusty for me," Paulette laughed, "I'll take a penthouse in New York!" Janet sighed. "That's exactly what I thought when I was sixteen, Paulette, I'm not worrying." The men came in from the patio, rubbing their hands with satisfaction before the open fire. Jerry put on a fresh log. He plumped up his cushion, putting it on the floor by his mother's chair and his head on her knee. "I'm tired, Mom. Think I'll tum in. Don't let these fellows keep you and Aunt Rhae up all night." Janet smoothed his dark head, glancing over at Paulette significant- "I get it." Paulette pouted charmingly. "Time to go to bed, dear." Her voice was exactly like Janet's motherliest tone. Everyone laughed with pleasure, and one by one the guests went to their rooms, Jerry and Paulette last so they could say goodnight in their childhood way. Then, at last, Paul and Janet were alone. The last, bright log fell apart, flamed anew, and burned steadily. Paul sighed contentedly: "Let's sit here 'till the fire goes out." He stowed his long frame into a corner of the big couch and drew Janet into the circle of his arm. "Know what tomorrow is, Jan?" he asked. "Tomorrow?" Jerry called from his bedroom, overhearing him. "What's tomorrow, Dad?" (Concluded on page 64) Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "
