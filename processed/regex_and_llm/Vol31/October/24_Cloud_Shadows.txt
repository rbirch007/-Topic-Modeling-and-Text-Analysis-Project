UR DEPARIMENT Theology Church History Lesson 4?The Church of Jesus Christ Organized Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, January 2, 1945 Objective: To study the simple and direct way in which the Church organization was effected to keep alive the gospel truths. ?FOR where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" (Matt. 18:20). So spake the Christ to his disciples in the days of his ministry, and so in spirit began, and has continued, the organization of his Church in this day of the fullness of times. "Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail" (Doc. And Cov. 6:34). These were his words to the few. Servants he had singled out from the world in the years prior to the 6th of April, 1830, the date on which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized. But what of the rock against which earth and hell could not prevail? The answer to this question is to be found in the experiences that touched the hearts of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery; of Martin Hartis and David Whitmer; yes, and of the others who came to know the power of godliness in the beginning years of the "marvelous work." These men had witnessed heavenly manifestations of such a personal nature that, should any disbelief occur, those who remained firm, even to the last one, still could have an individual testimony of what had been seen and heard. God knew the strength of his Church must rest upon a personal knowledge of the truth within each soul who came to make up the company of members in his kingdom. With the return of the Priesthood of God to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery came the gift of the Holy Ghost to bear witness to the truth of this latter-day work. A witness which could be stronger even than that gained through the personal visitation of heavenly beings. Thus all men who sought God earnestly Page 595 596 could find again on earth the authority to bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost, a gift which could plant in every human heart a personal testimony that God lives and that his kingdom is again upon the earth. So from one, then two, then three, then six, then nine,' then a hundred, a thousand, two thousand, on and on would the Church membership increase with men and women who had come to know personally that inner light of the gospel. God would build his Church upon the rock of revelation, personal and prophetic. In the month of April and in the year of 1830, the following revelation came through Joseph the Prophet: The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April?Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this church; And to Oliver Cowdery, who was also called of God, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the second elder of this church, and ordained under his hand; And this according to the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory, both now and forever. Amen" (Doc. And Coy. 20:1-4). Here was the will of the Lord concerning the establishment of his Church which, ten years before on the spring morning in the grove, he had promised to the youth, Joseph Smith. Now, faithful to his word, the year, the month, even the day for its organization was given. On the sixth day of April in 1830, it being a Tuesday, there gathered those few souls who had believed the words of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and had by them been baptized for the remission of their sins. The place of their gathering was at the house of Peter Whitmer. Some distance back from the country road, planted among the rolling fields and sheltered by spreading trees, stood this typical upstate New York home. There the "little flock" assembled to shake hands, rejoice, and await the will of God which they knew would come through his first two elders. But more was in. Readiness for those who made up this first historic gathering than they knew. Joseph and Oliver, they were to discover, in turn would also wait. The Church was to be founded upon the law of common consent. This meant that the body of the Church membership was to have the right of sanctioning by vote the appointment of Joseph and Oliver in the office of presiding elders (Doc. And Cov., Sec. 26:2; 28:13). God had given man his free agency. Even authorized servants of his mind and will could be accepted or rejected by the membership of his Church. Obedience must come voluntarily. This helped to make more clear the reason why his Church was to be founded upon the rock of revelation. As long as a majority of his followers were living in tune with the promptings of the Holy Spirit they could know of the faith and integrity of those whom God had called to lead them. A willing and joyful acceptance 1/See Documentary History of the Church, Vol. I, pp. 76-77. LESSON DEPARTMENT of the proper names to be voted upon was therefore assured. What a happy state of government this, for both those who lead and those who follow! It inspires trust and confidence and frees the will of all, both high and low, to work in peace and harmony for the upbuilding of the kingdom.
In addition to having the leaders as well as the lay members of the Church in perfect accord, the Lord had specified that his organization should also be "agreeable to the laws of our country." Since the Church was to be organized in Fayette, Seneca County, of the State of New York, it would be necessary to effect the organization by having six members officially named and so recorded by law.
Today in the New York State of Zion the organized wards of the Church still must comply with this law in order to meet. Six duly elected members, therefore, of any ward must so present their names to the State as the minimum number to be considered an organized group. The tenure of office for any member so elected is three years. In order to have a continuing organization of six, the terms of office for any two members expire on different years. It becomes necessary, then, at each annual ward conference to re-elect to vote two members of the original six, or two entirely new members. Thus, according to the present practice, the names of the bishop, his two counselors, the ward clerk, and two other members of the ward the bishop nominates are officially elected by the ward, and their names recorded for the books of public record of the State of New York. This election, also, is as simple as that
the legal right of the ward to meet, always follows the familiar pattern so well understood in the Church today of sustaining, by a show of hands, the ward officers and teachers.
Since these experiences have become familiar to Latter-day Saints now residing in the Empire State, for them to read that the Church was organized with six members, adds a deeper significance to that Tuesday on the 6th day of April, 1830. And so should one consult the books of public record long since filed away in the archives of New York State for that day, one would find the following names: Joseph Smith, Jun., Oliver Cowdery, Hyrum Smith, Peter Whitmer, Jun., Samuel H. Smith, and David Whitmer. We will leave it to the reader to decide why these names, with the exception of the first two elders, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery?whom God had set at the head?should have been selected from among the baptized members there assembled to comply with the command of God that his Church should be organized. Whatever answers are given to this question are of no great moment other than that of personal longing to know exactly what were the happy details that went to make up this historic day. Perhaps the esteem and love of this group for the young men of the Smith family, plus the hospitality of the Whitmers, had something to do with it. When all was in readiness, Joseph Smith opened the meeting with prayer and then in direct and simple speech asked all of those present if they were willing to accept him and Oliver as the leaders and teachers in 598 the kingdom of God; further, were those present willing to become organized as a church? As with one response all agreed, whereupon Joseph laid his hands on Oliver and ordained him an elder in the Church of Christ, after which Joseph received the same ordination and office under the hands of Oliver. The sacrament of the Lord's supper was administered, and then followed the confirmation of the baptized members of the Church who also were made recipients of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, Joseph and Oliver officiating. The Spirit was richly abundant, all rejoiced and praised God, many prophesied. Thus in simplicity and by the law of common consent was founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Thus arose, as a system, what the world terms Mormonism,?universally regarded as the most remarkable religious movement of modern times; detested and denounced through Christendom as a dangerous and soul-destroying imposture, but revered and defended by its disciples as the wonderful work of the Almighty, the veritable "marvelous work and wonder" foretold by Isaiah and other ancient seers, which was to prepare the world, by the preaching of a restored gospel and the founding of a latterday Zion for Messiah's second coming and the advent of the Millennium (Whitney, History of Utah, Vol. 1, P- 59). "By their fruits ye shall know them," said the Savior. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class catty on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doc. Trine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for our life in this day. 1. For what do you remember each of the six original members of the Church? (The teacher could list the six names on the board to help start the discussion, Follow whatever comes from this activity and response with the suggested readings presently given.) Hyrum Smith, Peter Whitmer, Junior, Samuel H. Smith and David Whitmer, four of the original six first members of the Church, early sought the will of the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph, concerning his wishes toward them. The Lord said to Peter Whitmer, "Behold, blessed are you for this thing" (Doc. And Cov., Sec. 16:5). Among other reasons which may come to mind as to why these men were chosen to become the four of the first six members, certainly, should be listed their humility and desire to know the will of the Lord. For a closer picture of these men have the following Sections in the Doc. And Cov. Read: 11; 14; 16; 23; 24. What personal words of comfort and warming do you find in these Sections which bear specifically on the life of each man? The Doctrine and Covenants Commentary has rich historical notes for these Sections. 2. Several revelations of the Prophet Joseph were received in the presence of his brethren. How do you think they knew when he spoke in the name of the Lord? The 21st Section of the Doctrine and Covenants was given during the meeting called for the organization of the Church. Have this read. What lessons today could the saints take from this revelation? The next question may be used if needed for further class activity or it may be assigned for home study. Section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants, a revelation on Church government given in April 1830, can be most enlightening to one wishing to read, in direct form, the operation of Church government set up to administer the gospel plan. Think as you read it of your experiences of worship as a member of the Church, LESSON DEPARTMENT 599
