Toward Richer Living Dr. Franklin S. Harris President, Brigham Young University SOMEONE has said that the place in which a person finds himself is much less significant than the direction and rate at which he is traveling. This might be applied to the state of his wealth, the condition of his health, the amount of his education, or to his social status. A person of abundant means who is losing his wealth is less to be envied than one not having so much who has a certain means of improving his lot. A person with poor health who has discovered the source of his trouble and has the means of restoring himself to vigor, is in a better condition than a person with relatively better health who develops a disease that will gradually undermine his physical stamina. These applications to individuals might also be made to society as a whole. It is tremendously important, therefore, to know the direction in which our civilization is moving and the rate at which it will probably travel. The opinions of students of these subjects are far from harmonious. Some are sure that the world is going to pieces. They frequently center their pessimism on the young people who, they say, are headed right "for the dogs." Others with more optimism see only good in the world. They discount what they call the exceptional case of delinquency, and they are willing to overlook almost any infringement on good decorum in their desire to be tolerant. These Page 550 divergent points of view have throughout all of recorded history led to debates on the question of whether the world is getting better Or worse. The present article does not presume to settle this age-old question, for which there is, in reality, no single, simple answer. It does, however, hope to point out some of the ways in which the lives of all of us are being enriched, to the extent that very satisfying living may be achieved, in spite of the fact that there are in the world conditions we should like to change. In fact, our efforts to improve these undesirable conditions may add to the worthwhile satisfactions of our lives. Certainly, there can be no doubt as to the desirability of rich living, in spite of such oft-repeated sayings as "Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise." The Savior himself said that he came that we might have life and have it more abundantly. A Book of Mormon prophet tells us that men are that they might have joy. One of the most fundamental principles of Latter-day Saint philosophy is the idea that progression is one of the chief aims of living. We believe this principle to extend beyond the limits of this life into the eternities, so that if a person continues diligently and intelligently to improve himself throughout time and eternity, he may eventually reach a very high state of exaltation. TOWARD RICHER LIVING With these fundamental principles in mind, let us take a look at the world in which we find ourselves, to see if we can discover its direction of travel, and also to make some Personal decisions regarding our course in the journey of life, One observation that is very plain to all who are familiar with the history of the race is that people in all lands are gradually becoming more conscious of the social point of view, In that very early chapter of human history, Cain asked the question, "Am I my brother's keeper?" in a tone that indicated that he did not consider himself to have that role. During most of the period of known history, People have not felt great responsibility for others who were less fortunate than themselves, Poverty, ignorance, and disease were considered to be largely the concern of the individual who happened to be afflicted by them. Even though Christ extolled the g00d neighbor, and Mohammed placed the giving of alms as one of his four cardinal principles, and, even though there have always been helpful hands for the unfortunate, this aid was more or less haphazard and often did more harm than good. In Persia, which is a Mohammedan country, traveled frequently with a general who was a member of Shalis cabinet, It was his custom each day to give two tomans (about a dollar) to the first beggar who accosted him, This finished his giving for the day. His religious duty was discharged and his conscience was clear, The fact that the person he gave to was not necessarily the most needy or that the money he gave may have done no teal good, did not enter the picture. His 551 religion told him to give alms; he gave alms, and that was all there was about it. The modern and, Particularly, the idea behind the Church Welfare Plan have quite different motives, the principle that no needy person who is willing to work shall go direct giving, however, goes the principle that the individual shall be. Come self-sustaining at the earliest possible time. The modern social point of view brings within its scope not only food and shelter, but also the elimination of ignorance and disease. IT is very unfortunate that social Progress has, in some cases, become involved with Partisan politics, A party, in order to gain popular support, may have tied up with its platform the promise of unusual benefits on the one hand, or of economies of public expenditures on the other, so that the scientific and proper solution of the problem of human needs may be entirely missed?and the whole question of social progress greatly retarded. The sooner these welfare programs are divorced from partisan politics the better for all concerned, trends be kept within Proper bounds so they will not suffer the reaction 552 which always follows unwarranted extremes., The advances obtained during the past generation by science and technology make available to even the family of modest income physical comforts and luxuries that could not be enjoyed even by kings two generations ago. On visiting many of the royal palaces of the Old World I have frequently been impressed by the fact that the wealthy monarchs of earlier times could not have the comforts in heating, lighting, and plumbing, that the tradesman of our day expects as a matter of course. The attempt of the wealthy of former days to increase their comforts required that they maintain a retinue of servants. "These could only imperfectly supply what a few cents worth of electricity and running water make available in every modern home. The use of many serving people inevitably leads to marked class distinctions. This condition is still found in the Orient where modern conveniences have not yet been developed. Social standing is often measured by the number of servants, and those who aspire to the esteem of their fellows refrain from doing manual labor since, in doing it, they lose caste. In Persia, I was constantly annoyed by having so many servants assigned to do the little tasks in my official work which |] should have preferred to do for myself, if custom had permitted. Fortunately, in the modern world, the tendency is away from personal service and toward professional help. We let machines do our physical work and we employ experts such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers, artists, and musicians to give specialized service. This trend is highly desirable since it Promotes a higher standard of living. Just think what riches are now available to all who have the desire and capacity to enjoy them! Take. For example, the field of music. The radio, phonographic recordings, and the opportunities to hear artists directly make available to Practically everyone the finest music of all the world's great composers. Even the rancher, isolated in the most remote part of the Country, may, by spending only a few dollars, have the means of tuning in to the greatest musical programs of the world. What richness of living is made possible by this combination of favorable circumstances that has developed in the modern world. In like manner, the culture of the past and the present in every field is within the reach of all, even though everyone is not prepared to take advantage of all of these good things. A certain background must be developed to insure adequate appreciation, but the education necessary for this can be had by anyone with ambition and capacity. The mechanical developments of the modern world mean that in agri. Culture, in manufacturing, and in transportation, only part of the energies of people will be required to satisfy human physical needs. This will give more leisure time for the refinements and enrichments that make life more worth living. Improvements in health resulting from the newer knowledge of nutrition, from more effective medicines. And from more consistent and temperate habits, make for much richer living, not only through the economies resulting from lessened sickness, TOWARD RICHER LIVING but also from the greater zest which follows good health. The opportunity which is going to be available for increased trave] in the world of the future will do much to add to people's enjoyment. Different countries make varying contributions through their arts and crafts. With more travel and improved transportation, the good things of each land become available to the people of other countries. All these resources make for more colorful and interesting living. The rugs of Persia, the silks of China, the linen of Ireland, the art of France, the music of Italy, the silverware of Mexico, the leather work of Spain are but a few of the fine things we can secure from our sister nations. Scientific discoveries, mechanical improvements, books, art, and music 553 are not, in themselves, any guarantee of better living or a more advanced society. The key to their value is in the hand of the individual. The human equation is the one to be solved. The good life and rich living cannot be crammed down the throat of the person who has no desire for them. The individual without character or constructive desires will not benefit by his opportunities. Certain spiritual resources must go with the material if complete living is to be realized. If all these things are kept in mind, however, there is little doubt that the trend of the times is toward richer living for all who have the ambition, the capacity, the character, and the humility to take advantage of what the modern world has to offer. Latter-day Saints should be the first to avail them selves of these good things. ? OCTOBER Leone E. McCune Extravagant fellow, is gay October Striding over the countryside, His pockets bulging with silver and gold? He scatters their contents far and wide. Flinging his gold in the cornfield, On the pumpkin and poplar tree, On the marigolds by the garden wall, And wherever the eye can see. He tosses silver into the stars, Into miniature lakes in the hollow, Into the frost at early dawn, On winging birds in the fallow. Basking in his golden sun This dream of wealth I'll borrow, Lend comfort to my chilling heart When snow falls on the morrow.
