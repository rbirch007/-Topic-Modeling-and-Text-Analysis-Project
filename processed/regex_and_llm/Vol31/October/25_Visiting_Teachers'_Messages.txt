Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes Lesson 4?Blessed Are They Which Do Hunger and Thirst After Righteousness Elder Bryant S. Hinckley For Tuesday, January 2, 1945 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled (Matt. 5:9). Objective: intellectual and spiritual growth. S6MAAN shall not live by bread alone," is the divine mandate. But man must have bread; he cannot live without it. The man who has lost all appetite for his daily bread is to be pitied. But how infinitely greater is the tragedy when all desire for the bread of life is lost. This higher hunger, the hunger for righteousness, is the mark of man's superiority; the secret of his progress; the source of his growth intellectually and spiritually. Those who hunger for knowledge and thirst for the truth have been the great teachers and leaders of the 'race. The Savior in speaking to the Nephites gave this Beatitude a definite meaning. Third Nephi 12:6 states: "And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost." This is a clear and definite promise. What does it mean to be To show that the hunger and thirst for righteousness is the source of filled with the Holy Ghost? The scriptures make clear the mission of the Holy Ghost: It is to guide you into all truth; to bring to your remembrance things of the past and to make known to you things to come. Speaking of the Holy Ghost which is promised to those who "hunger and thirst after righteousness," the Savior said: "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.... But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (John 14:16-17, 26). 600 "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:" (John 15:26) The power of the Holy Ghost makes men greater, increases their wisdom, enlightens their minds, gives them faith, hope, charity and the impelling power of a strong conviction. This is the peculiar and precious gift which the gospel offers to all who will obey its precepts and conform to its teachings, to all "who hunger and thirst after righteousness." ???
