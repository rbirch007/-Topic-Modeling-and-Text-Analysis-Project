BURY ME QUIETLY WHEN I DIE On the "iron rod" I have laid my hold; If I "keep the faith," and like Paul of old, Shall have "fought the good fight," and Christ, the Lord Has a crown in Store, with a full reward Of the Holy Priesthood in fulness, rife With the gifts and the powers of an end. Less life, And a glorious Mansion for me on high; Bury me quietly when I die. Have laid my hold; I am aiming to earn a celestial crown? To merit a heavenly, approv'd renown; 581 And whether in laid? gave or in tomb I am summer sky; Bury me quietly when I die. When my spirit ascends to the world above To unite with the choirs in celestial love; Let the finger of silence control the bell, To restrain the chime of a funeral knell? Let no mourning strain?not a sound be heard By which a sad pulse of the heart is stirr'd? No note of sorrow to prompt a sigh; Bury me quietly when I die. What avail the Parade and the splendor here, To a legal heir to a heavenly sphere? To the heirs of salvation, what is the worth, In their perishing state, the frail things of earth? What is death, to the good, but an entrance gate, That is placed on the verge of a rich estate, here commissioned escorts are waiting by? Bury me quietly when I die. Like a beacon that uses O'er ocean's wave, There's a light?there's a life beyond the grave; The future is bright, and it beckons me on Where the noble and pure and the brave have gone, Who have battled for mind and might, With their garments clean mor bright: They are dwelling with God, in a world on high: Bury me quietly when I die. ?Eliza R. Snow Smith Utah, Salt Lake City, April 13, 1885.
