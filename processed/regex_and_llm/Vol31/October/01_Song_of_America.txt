SONG OF AMERICA Elizabeth Burningham America! I sing of these: Incredible cities of awesome heights, Clangorous days and neoned nights, Brine and beach, spindrift, tide, Tipping sail. The spongy glide Of marsh where tules run, Of mountain snow, and valley sun. Dry, clanging color of chasm'd rock In spill: of desert. 'The shock Of a sudden virgin spot. Singing Darkies through down of cotton swinging. Palm and cedar, stretching pine, Field and furrow, farm and vine. Wind and green wave in corn and wheat, Squares of orchard, strict and neat. America! I sing of these: The westward way of pioneers, Step of progress across the years, The pan and the mule, scented sage, Indian's retreating rage; Of derrick and crane and motor roar. Giant snouts of steel that gore Earth for metal. Spike and rail, Sturdy wings through sun and gale. America! I sing of these: Shadowy crosses on a hill; Dust on the rust of guns long still, Gold stars, trees planted in memory, All for the sake of liberty! The washed-in souls from overseas, The weary ones seeking surcease From ragged schemes of rotted lords; Civilizations suave and cruel. The hordes We gulped with hardy insides, We of soft hearts and tender hides. But most of all I sing of these: Of happy children at their play, Peaceful hours at end of day, Birthday cake, geranium on the sill, Sunday supper, picnic on the hill, A prayer at church, laughter on Every street. A new wet lawn. For these are the things that make each part. Stitch. Seam.: Sinew. Heart. That make this land, Land Of The Free, America, I sing of Thee!

OCTOBER 1944: 66 AND as Jesus Passed by, 547 AND as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was bhnd from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born bhnd?" (John 9:1-2) The very question seems to de-clare a prevailing notion that infirm-ity or affliction necessitates the con-clusion that it is the result of sin. Jesus with finality exploded that notion for he answered: ''Neither hath this man sinned, nor his par-ents: but that the works of God should be made, manifest in him.*' He proceeded to give point to his emphatic declaration by seizing the occasion both to manifest the works of God and to absolve the afflicted man of the imputation lurking in the question, for he anointed the man's eyes with clay moistened with spittle and bade him wash in the pool of Siloam, whence he came away seeing. This is not to say that physical and mental affliction may not result from sin. It is well known that they do, which perhaps may account for the persistence of the notion implicit in the question of the disciples. The point is that such misfortune is not, standing alone, proof of wrongdoing. This should bring comfort to inno-cent safferers and at the same time admonish observers of infirmity to sentiments of charity. Closely akin to the idea nourished by the disciples, and of particular consequence under existing circumstances, ist he disturbing question whether men who die in batfle have by misdeeds forfeited the protection of providential care. It haunts the minds of conscientious. God-fearing mothers, wives, sweethearts. They wonder why, their loved ones being good, and engaged, as they believe, in a righteous cause, God did not protect them, or, since these have died, are they guilty of offense. Such dread questions can arise only from failure of right understanding. If God forthwith smote down the evildoer, there would be no wicked left; if he preserved always the good, the righteous would never die. There would be little room left for the uncoerced play o f freedom of choice if goodness were immediately and directly rewarded by immunity from trial and sorrow, and wrongdoing were discouraged by summary and condign punishment to the offender. That would present a condition but little removed from compulsion. That is not the process by which men develop their latent powers and grow in the strength of love of right. If every act were done under the immediate constraint of fear of direct consequences or certainty of escape from suffering, as the case might be, there would be no room for the exercise of f aith or for trust in the ultimate triumph of good over evil in the hearts of men. The doer of good would be little removed from the 548 plane of the bribetaker, and refraining from evil would be on the level of cowering fear. There has never been any promise to the righteous of immunity from privation, suffering, hardship, sorrow and death. All these things the Redeemer himself suffered, and the record tells us that he learned obedience through the things he suffered. In his lofty admonition issued from the Mount, Jesus said, "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you." And _ all this they should do that they might "be the children of your Father which is in heaven." 'That was the Father's course as Jesus reminded them "for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." Thus the divine power rises high above the mean pettiness of capricious tyranny in its exercise. Every one recognizes its superiority. "For," said he, "if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same? "And if ye salute your brethren only, what-do ye more than others? Do not even the publicans so? "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." attain this status men must face evil and overcome it with good. They must rise to a higher plane than returning hate for hate and seeking reprisal against offenders. Reprisal invites retaliation which, in turn, induces payment again in kind, and so the evil spirals and weaves about those who indulge it an entangling web from which there is no escape save through rewarding evil with good. Besides, the passageway from mortality into immortality is through death. All men must pass through it, even the faithful who are alive at the Lord's coming. "And he that liveth when the Lord shall come, and hath kept the faith, blessed is he; nevertheless, it is appointed to him to die at the age of man" (Doc. And Cov. 63:50). In like ae Alma records: "but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end" - (Alma 12:27). And Nephi writes: "For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfill the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall;... "Wherefore it must needs be an infinite atonement?save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption"...(2 Nephi 9:6-7). Paul instructed the Corinthians: "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality" (I Cor. 15:53). That all must die we know from the unbroken experience of the race. What we do not know is the time and circumstances of its coming. From the scripture we learn that it is not an unmixed evil, but marks a stage in the course of life, perchance opening the way to a richer, fuller living than could be known in mortality. DEATH AND SIN 549 The idea of death and the means of it would seem not to be of primary importance. The spiritual state of preparedness for it when it comes is all-important. The Lord has said: "And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them" (Doc. and Cov. 42:46).
This last quoted statement comes from a Section largely devoted to temporal admonition with promises for conformance. But it makes very clear that there are times when death may not be averted, for the Lord counsels respecting the sick: "And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed" (Doc. and Cov. 42:48).
Thus it is evident that the righteous as well as the wicked must die. When the time for that change comes even faith may not avert it. This is not to say that men may not die before an appointed time nor that death is to be sought for. Obviously, by violating the laws of health or even by his own hand man may hasten death. But it does not follow that because a man dies it is the result of his sin. There is no more reason for supposing that death on the field of battle is evidence of individual misdeeds than if death resulted from any manner of illness or from so-called natural causes.
The soldier on the field of battle is there under command or compulsion. If he dies prematurely no fault can attach to him. That responsibility rests with the instigators of the conflict. He may be as clean and as worthy and as well prepared to die as those who die from other causes, in which event his loved ones have the consoling assurance of God himself that death "shall be sweet to him." As Paul stated it: "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory" (I Cor. 15:54). MAGIC IN MEMORY Courtney E. Cottam
There is magic in memory, glorious, precious; Wind in the eaves when dark clouds hang low; A song clearly heard on a cold, crystal evening? The snap of a twig, overburdened with snow.
There is magic in memory, comforting, deathless, Bringing you back to my hungering heart; Knowing my loved one will live on forever, And though we are parted, we are not apart. Toward Richer Living Dr. Franklin S. Harris President, Brigham Young University SOMEONE has said that the place in which a person finds himself is much less significant than the direction and rate at which he is traveling. This might be applied to the state of his wealth, the condition of his health, the amount of his education, or to his social status. A person of abundant means who is losing his wealth is less to be envied than one not having so much who has a certain means of improving his lot. A person with poor health who has discovered the source of his trouble and has the means of restoring himself to vigor, is in a better condition than a person with relatively better health who develops a disease that will gradually undermine his physical stamina. These applications to individuals might also be made to society as a whole. It is tremendously important, therefore, to know the direction in which our civilization is moving and the rate at which it will probably travel. The opinions of students of these subjects are far from harmonious. Some are sure that the world is going to pieces. They frequently center their pessimism on the young people who, they say, are headed right "for the dogs." Others with more optimism see only good in the world. They discount what they call the exceptional case of delinquency, and they are willing to overlook almost any infringement on good decorum in their desire to be tolerant. These Page 550 divergent points of view have throughout all of recorded history led to debates on the question of whether the world is getting better Or worse. The present article does not presume to settle this age-old question, for which there is, in reality, no single, simple answer. It does, however, hope to point out some of the ways in which the lives of all of us are being enriched, to the extent that very satisfying living may be achieved, in spite of the fact that there are in the world conditions we should like to change. In fact, our efforts to improve these undesirable conditions may add to the worthwhile satisfactions of our lives. Certainly, there can be no doubt as to the desirability of rich living, in spite of such oft-repeated sayings as "Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise." The Savior himself said that he came that we might have life and have it more abundantly. A Book of Mormon prophet tells us that men are that they might have joy. One of the most fundamental principles of Latter-day Saint philosophy is the idea that progression is one of the chief aims of living. We believe this principle to extend beyond the limits of this life into the eternities, so that if a person continues diligently and intelligently to improve himself throughout time and eternity, he may eventually reach a very high state of exaltation. TOWARD RICHER LIVING With these fundamental principles in mind, let us take a look at the world in which we find ourselves, to see if we can discover its direction of travel, and also to make some Personal decisions regarding our course in the journey of life, One observation that is very plain to all who are familiar with the history of the race is that people in all lands are gradually becoming more conscious of the social point of view, In that very early chapter of human history, Cain asked the question, "Am I my brother's keeper?" in a tone that indicated that he did not consider himself to have that role. During most of the period of known history, People have not felt great responsibility for others who were less fortunate than themselves, Poverty, ignorance, and disease were considered to be largely the concern of the individual who happened to be afflicted by them. Even though Christ extolled the g00d neighbor, and Mohammed placed the giving of alms as one of his four cardinal principles, and, even though there have always been helpful hands for the unfortunate, this aid was more or less haphazard and often did more harm than good. In Persia, which is a Mohammedan country, traveled frequently with a general who was a member of Shalis cabinet, It was his custom each day to give two tomans (about a dollar) to the first beggar who accosted him, This finished his giving for the day. His religious duty was discharged and his conscience was clear, The fact that the person he gave to was not necessarily the most needy or that the money he gave may have done no teal good, did not enter the picture. His 551 religion told him to give alms; he gave alms, and that was all there was about it. The modern and, Particularly, the idea behind the Church Welfare Plan have quite different motives, the principle that no needy person who is willing to work shall go direct giving, however, goes the principle that the individual shall be. Come self-sustaining at the earliest possible time. The modern social point of view brings within its scope not only food and shelter, but also the elimination of ignorance and disease. IT is very unfortunate that social Progress has, in some cases, become involved with Partisan politics, A party, in order to gain popular support, may have tied up with its platform the promise of unusual benefits on the one hand, or of economies of public expenditures on the other, so that the scientific and proper solution of the problem of human needs may be entirely missed?and the whole question of social progress greatly retarded. The sooner these welfare programs are divorced from partisan politics the better for all concerned, trends be kept within Proper bounds so they will not suffer the reaction 552 which always follows unwarranted extremes., The advances obtained during the past generation by science and technology make available to even the family of modest income physical comforts and luxuries that could not be enjoyed even by kings two generations ago. On visiting many of the royal palaces of the Old World I have frequently been impressed by the fact that the wealthy monarchs of earlier times could not have the comforts in heating, lighting, and plumbing, that the tradesman of our day expects as a matter of course. The attempt of the wealthy of former days to increase their comforts required that they maintain a retinue of servants. "These could only imperfectly supply what a few cents worth of electricity and running water make available in every modern home. The use of many serving people inevitably leads to marked class distinctions. This condition is still found in the Orient where modern conveniences have not yet been developed. Social standing is often measured by the number of servants, and those who aspire to the esteem of their fellows refrain from doing manual labor since, in doing it, they lose caste. In Persia, I was constantly annoyed by having so many servants assigned to do the little tasks in my official work which |] should have preferred to do for myself, if custom had permitted. Fortunately, in the modern world, the tendency is away from personal service and toward professional help. We let machines do our physical work and we employ experts such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers, artists, and musicians to give specialized service. This trend is highly desirable since it Promotes a higher standard of living. Just think what riches are now available to all who have the desire and capacity to enjoy them! Take. For example, the field of music. The radio, phonographic recordings, and the opportunities to hear artists directly make available to Practically everyone the finest music of all the world's great composers. Even the rancher, isolated in the most remote part of the Country, may, by spending only a few dollars, have the means of tuning in to the greatest musical programs of the world. What richness of living is made possible by this combination of favorable circumstances that has developed in the modern world. In like manner, the culture of the past and the present in every field is within the reach of all, even though everyone is not prepared to take advantage of all of these good things. A certain background must be developed to insure adequate appreciation, but the education necessary for this can be had by anyone with ambition and capacity. The mechanical developments of the modern world mean that in agri. Culture, in manufacturing, and in transportation, only part of the energies of people will be required to satisfy human physical needs. This will give more leisure time for the refinements and enrichments that make life more worth living. Improvements in health resulting from the newer knowledge of nutrition, from more effective medicines. And from more consistent and temperate habits, make for much richer living, not only through the economies resulting from lessened sickness, TOWARD RICHER LIVING but also from the greater zest which follows good health. The opportunity which is going to be available for increased trave] in the world of the future will do much to add to people's enjoyment. Different countries make varying contributions through their arts and crafts. With more travel and improved transportation, the good things of each land become available to the people of other countries. All these resources make for more colorful and interesting living. The rugs of Persia, the silks of China, the linen of Ireland, the art of France, the music of Italy, the silverware of Mexico, the leather work of Spain are but a few of the fine things we can secure from our sister nations. Scientific discoveries, mechanical improvements, books, art, and music 553 are not, in themselves, any guarantee of better living or a more advanced society. The key to their value is in the hand of the individual. The human equation is the one to be solved. The good life and rich living cannot be crammed down the throat of the person who has no desire for them. The individual without character or constructive desires will not benefit by his opportunities. Certain spiritual resources must go with the material if complete living is to be realized. If all these things are kept in mind, however, there is little doubt that the trend of the times is toward richer living for all who have the ambition, the capacity, the character, and the humility to take advantage of what the modern world has to offer. Latter-day Saints should be the first to avail them selves of these good things. ? OCTOBER Leone E.

Consultant in Pediatrics, Utah State Department of Health Editor's Note: This article is reprinted with the kind permission of the Utah State Department of Health from an article "Rheumatic Heart Disease in Utah" which appeared in Your Health, monthly periodical of the Utah State Department of Health, April 1944.]
The Problem
IN 1943 an epidemic of infantile paralysis killed 23 people under the age of 25. This most unusual occurrence provoked tremendous public excitement and sympathy, and facilitated the collection of large sums of money to be used in combating the disease. In the same year rheumatic heart disease killed almost 62 young people in the same age group, and perhaps 200 more older individuals. This was not an unusual thing, as approximately the same number of victims are claimed every year, yet it provoked no public comment, no demands for action, no drives for funds . . .
How does it happen that a disease like infantile paralysis attracts so much attention, while rheumatic heart disease, which kills and cripples from ten to twenty times as many people each year, goes along year after year with very little interference? A comparison of the two diseases may throw some light on this question. When poliomyelitis strikes hard enough to cause any damage, the effect is immediately apparent. The individual is obviously sick, and the evil effects, whether they result in crippling or death, are soon clearly visible. On the contrary, rheumatic heart disease, in most cases, probably has a very insidious
onset, with symptoms so slight as to be unnoticed or disregarded by those who see the child; and it may take anywhere from a few weeks to a few years before someone discovers that the heart has been severely damaged. Few deaths occur in the beginning; in many cases a number of years intervene before the accumulated insults result in failure of the heart. Adults die of injury which was inflicted, and which might have been prevented, in childhood. An attack of infantile paralysis so mild as not to result in crippling within a week or two will not only leave the child without harmful effects, but will protect him against any future attacks; whereas, an attack of so-called rheumatic fever, so mild as to arouse no concern, will not only result in damage to the heart, but will make the child more susceptible to future attacks. The crippling which results from infantile paralysis is usually obvious, and of a type which arouses sympathy in all who observe the unfortunate victim; whereas, a cardiac cripple, unable to proceed down the street at a gait faster than a leisurely walk, will be unnoticed because he wears no brace, carries no crutches, and does not limp.
Case Finding
The first essential in attempting
Page 554 RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE to reduce mortality from this disease is to find the cases. It is not enough to recognize the children who become sick with classical acute rheumatic fever, and who show the obvious findings of fever?red, tender swollen joints, skin rashes, and nodules; or the children acutely ill with dilated hearts, pericardial friction rubs, and signs of failure; or the children with St. Vitus' Dance. Parents and physicians should be on the alert for children with more vague complaints of poor appetite, failure to grow normally, pallor, elevated pulse rate, and so-called "growing pains." Such symptoms should call for very careful examination, supplemented by such time-tested laboratory procedures as sedimentation rates and X-ray studies. A sedimentation rate should be as much of a standard office procedure as a urinalysis or blood count; indeed, it takes less time than either, requires the simplest apparatus, and gives invaluable information in following a case of rheumatic heart disease. Where there is a family history of the disease, it is particularly imperative to be on the alert, and to cultivate an attitude of suspicion towards the mildest complaints. In the past, it may be that too much attention has been directed to the heart, and too little to the whole child. The presence of a heart murmur does not necessarily mean heart disease; nor does the absence of a murmur rule it out. Even in those cases where it is definitely known that the murmur heard is the result of an attack of rheumatic fever at some time in the past, it gives little or no information as to the current status of the rheumatic infection, whether it is active or quiescent. A 555 stop sign at a railroad crossing does not necessarily mean that a train is coming along in the next two minutes, but it does indicate the advisability of looking up and down the track; and a heart murmur should have the same significance. Treatment The second point of attack is proper treatment of the disease. The most important measure available at present?the fundamental measure ?is rest in bed. This has been known for a long time, but it has not generally been realized just how long such periods of bed rest must continue. It is not enough to keep the child at rest until the pain is gone, or until the temperature is normal, or until he feels well; it is necessary to keep him at absolute bed rest?and this means lying down ?until all evidence of rheumatic infection has disappeared, as determined not only by his appearance, pulse rate, appetite, and physical findings, but by the return of the sedimentation rate to normal. This usually requires on the average closer to six months than six weeks, and often longer; and will be followed by a long period of gradually increasing activity before the child is able to resume his normal manner of life. Allowing a child to get out of bed and return to school while there is any evidence, no matter how mild, of rheumatic activity is simply to invite a flare-up of the smouldering disease process. Where can this bed rest be given? In the home? Ask any mother how easy she thinks it would be to keep her active eight year-old son flat in bed for six months. In the hospital? Ask any hospital administrator how many 556 beds he can afford to tie up for six months?particularly in these days. Ask the children who are there, exposed to cross infections, with no provision for entertainment or education, spending their time watching other luckier children with appendicitis or pneumonia go home after ten days. Neither of these is satisfactory. The proper treatment of rheumatic heart disease requires ideally a special type of institution, preferably with facilities for both the acute and convalescent cases, with ample provision for continuing their education and maintaining their morale. As a step in this direction, some communities are fortunate enough to possess convalescent hospitals, which can furnish care for children with a wide variety of crippling conditions, including those with rheumatic heart disease and infantile paralysis... Prevention Finally, there is the matter of prevention. It is unfortunate that we do not possess any vaccine which protects against the disease, such as we have to protect us against diphtheria, smallpox, and other plagues. We do know, however, that a rheumatic child will have fewer recurrences if he lives in clean, hygienic surroundings, receives a complete and well-balanced diet, and is protected against infections, particularly against those caused by the hemolytic streptococcus. The prophylactic use of salicylates and sulfonamides is now being tested, but their proponents have not yet advocated their general use. Parenthetically, it should be pointed out that all authorities on the subject are unanimous in their condemnation of the use of sulfonamide drugs in the acute or active stages of the disease.

The New Turkey Dr. Leland Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah [This is the fifth in a series of articles by Dr. Creer on the historical backgrounds of some of the countries involved in the present war.?Ed.] AT the beginning of the twentieth century, the Ottoman still blocked the eastern end of the Mediterranean, enveloping it wholly from the Black Sea and the Dardanelles to the Red Sea and the Nile Delta?a great sprawling colossus sometimes derisively referred to as the "Sick Man of Europe." And indeed a very sick man he was, and yet, within a de cade after the close of World Wat J, when through the Treaty of Sevres the victorious Allies had planned to this once grandiose 'Sick Man" revived and, under the leadership of one Mustapha Kemal Pasha, reasserted himself through one of the most remarkable nationalistic revolutions of all time. As a result, the new postwar Turkey has become a nation as vigorous and progressive as its parent was feeble and reactionary, country as compact and homogeneous as its progenitor was unwieldy and composite. The original Ottoman Turks were one of the Central Asian hordes. Eventually anchored themselves in Anatolia at the close of the thirteenth century. The tribe took its name from one, Orthman, who succeeded Ertogrul in 1288. The latter had founded the nucleus of the kingdom in the plain stretching between Brusa and Nicaea in the ' northwestern cornet of Asia Minor. The first capital was Yemshebr. For more than two centuries thereafter, the successors of Ertogrul and Orthman process the Arab lands of Syria, Egypt, Iraq, and 1306, the conquest. Of the Balkan Peninsula was begun. Eastern Macedonia was conquered in 137 Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, was taken in 1385. On June 15, 1389, one of the most fateful battles in the history of the Near East was fought on the historic plain of Kossovo in modern Yugoslavia. Here the Turks overwhelmed the armies of the Slavic Confederacy and Serbia, as an independent state, was blotted out. For five hundred years never rallied. Many of them took refuge in the mountains of Monte: negro and there, throughout this benighted period, maintained 4 brave but hopeless fight for freedom. Others migrated to Bosnia and Hungary. Beginning in 1397) the Ottomans turned their attention to Greece. Thessaly, Phocis, Locris, part of Epirus and southern Albania were quickly conquered. Athens and Salonica alone of the important Greek cities remained for a few decades longer in Christian hands. In 1440, at the battle of Varna and later in 1448, at the second battle of Kossovo, the Turks drove the Hungarians out of the Balkans and, on May 29, 1453, carried by assault the great city of Constantinople. This latter event ended the existence of the last surviving remnant of the once glorious Roman Empire. Page  BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA | HUNGARY SERBIA ARABIA ?Drawing by Evan Jensen TURKEY In 1459, Serbia was annexed outright to the Ottoman Empire; Bosnia shared a like fate earlier in 1453; and Herzegovina in 1465. In 1471, the last Seljukian principality, Karamania, was added. In 1475, the Turks, by conquering Azov and the Crimea, acquired complete control of both shores of the Black Sea. In 1512, a three years' war with the Shah Ismail of Persia resulted in the acquisition of Mesopotamia. Egypt, Syria, and Arabia were successively conquered during the first two decades of the sixteenth century. These conquests led to the transferal of the caliphate to the sultan, who henceforth became the protector of the holy places of Islam and Christendom, and the spiritual head of Mohammedanism throughout the world. In 1522, the important island of Rhodes in the Dodecanese fell, and the Knights Hospitalers were forced to flee to Crete, later, in 1530, to THE NEW TURKEY found a permanent home on the island of Malta. Hungary and Transylvania were conquered in 1541. In 1529, Suleiman the Magnificent, greatest of Turkish sultans, with 250,000 men and 300 guns attempted to besiege Vienna. In view of the menace to Christendom, Protestants and Catholics alike prepared to defend the Austrian capital. After a siege of twenty-four days, Suleiman was forced to withdraw. Unsuccessful attempts to capture the city were made again in 1532, 1541, and 1566. The year 1529 was a crucial one for the Moslems, for it witnessed the termination of their victorious advance in Europe. Of similar importance was the great naval battle of Lepanto, off the western coast of Greece, in 1571. In this engagement the Turks were defeated by a combination of Christian states which included Spain, Tuscany, Parma, Lucca, Venice, Genoa, and the Papacy. This crucial victory proved that the Turks were no longer invincible. Henceforth their political power and prestige rapidly declined. Many factors had contributed to the phenomenal rise of the Ottomans and the rapid extension of their empire. Among these may be mentioned: (1) the hopeless decrepitude of the Byzantine Empire; (2). The customary lack of cohesion among the Slavic peoples; (3) the jealousies and antagonisms of the Western Powers, particularly during the sixteenth century; (4) the Babylonian captivity at Avignon and the subsequent schism of the Papacy; (5) the military prowess and shrewd statesmanship of Suleiman the Magnificent; and (6) the splendid organization and discipline of the Turkish Army during the fifteenth, sixteenth, and part of the seventeenth centuries. 559 N 1699, through the Treaty of Carlowitz, the 'Turks suffered their first major territorial loss when they were forced to cede to the Hapsburg emperor the rich province of Transylvania and the whole of Hungary, except the Banat of Temesvar. About the same time (1696), Peter the Great invaded the Crimea and captured the fortress of Azov. This was the first appearance of Russia in the Black Sea reg. Ion. It was just the beginning, however, of a series of intrigues which were to make Russia the most deadly enemy of the Turks. Russia's advance toward the Black Sea was assiduously fostered by Catherine the Great. By the Treaties of Kutschukkainardji (1774) and Jassy (1792), the Porte was forced to acknowledge the cession of the entire Crimea to Russia, and to accept the role of Russia as special protector of Christian subjects residing within the Turkish Empire. During the nineteenth century, the rapid disintegration of the polyglot Turkish Empire was the direct result of the resurgence of nationalism which, in turn, had found its origin in French Revolutionary influences and in the vigorous opposition everywhere expressed toward the reactionary Metternich regime. Thus, in 1831, Greece won its independence and the Serbs acquired political autonomy. By the Treaty of Berlin (1878) the independence of Serbia, Rumania, and Montenegro was confirmed, and autonomy granted to the provinces of Bosnia. Herzegovina, Eastern Roumelia and Bulgaria, the latter under Russian protection. The Turks ? lost Algeria (1847), Tunis (1881), and 560 Morocco (1912) to France; Tripoli (1911) to Italy; and Egypt (1881) to England. In 1908, Bulgaria became independent, while Bosnia and Herzegovina were ceded to Austria. As a result of the Balkan Wars (1912-1913), the Turks gave Crete to Greece, acknowledged the newly created state of Albania, and surrendered Macedonia, her only remaining Balkan territory, to Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria. As a result of these losses, the European possessions of Turkey had been reduced to a small strip of territory drawn within a boundary extending from Media on the Black Sea to Enos at the mouth of the Maritza on the Aegean, and including only 10,882 square miles, an area equivalent in size to that of the State of Maryland. Then came World War I (1914- 1918). Making common cause with Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria, against England, France, and Russia, largely because of fear of the pincer implications of an Anglo-Russian alliance, the Turks abolished the hated foreign-imposed rights of extra-territoriality with a sweeping gesture of defiance, and proclaimed a holy war against the enemies of Germany. But the Turkish armies were defeated, a humiliating armistice was signed at Mudros, and the discredited Young Turk leaders fled the country. An analysis of the factors contributing to the disruption of the Turkish Empire reveal the following as among the most important: (1) the lack of any constructive program of economic and social welfare, hence the masses of the peasantry remained apathetic and passively discontented; (2) the decadence in efficiency and prestige of the Janissaries, corps d'elite of the Turkish army; (3) deterioration of the personnel of the sultanate (for example, there were twelve successions to the throne in the seventeenth century as compared with six in the sixteenth, and of the former, three were dethroned and one murdured?"Until the accession of the Keuprilis in 1653, the internal history of the empire is one monotonous vista of anarchy and decay."); (4) lack of education; (5) inability of the administration to assimilate the various non-national minorities; (6) the absence of democratic institutions; (7) the vigorous reaction of the non-Turkish minorities toward the Young Turks' policy of Ottomanization, or racial absorption; (8) the application of a militant form of nationalism in Europe during the nineteenth century which, among other things, accelerated the disruption of non-national empires; and (g) the diplomatic equipoise among the Great Powers which kept alive Turkey, even as the "Sick Man of Europe." Had the Turkish Parliament ratified the Treaty of Sevres, as the latter was drawn up by the Allies and signed on August 10, 1920 by representatives of the discredited Sultan Mohammed VI, the once resplendent Ottoman Empire would have been reduced to an insignificant region of desert and mountains tucked away in Asia Minor. However, despite the fact that Sultan Mohammed VI, overawed by the Allied ships and forces at Constantinople, had agreed to ratify the document, an energetic group of Nationalists, led by Mustapha Kemal Pasha, thought otherwise and determined to prevent ratification. 'Thus was begun the second great renaissance in modern Turkey, a revolution which was destined to transform that decadent state into one of the most progressive and forward looking. Countries in all Europe. THE NEW TURKEY MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA had proved himself to be one of Turkey's best generals in the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. During World War I, he played a conspicuous part in the defeat of the Allies at Gallipoli in 1915. Under the circumstances, it is not surprising to learn that Kemal was deeply chagrined when the Allies successfully imposed on Turkey the Armistice of Mudros (October 1918), and that, in retaliation, he gathered about him in central Anatolia the nucleus of a new party, the Turkish Nationalists, who planned at once the resuscitation of their national homeland. In July 1919, accordingly, a Nationalist Congress was called at Erzerum to consider party policy. Later, on January 28, 1920, a second Congress was called at Constantinople. This body adopted a statement of principles since known as the Turkish National Pact. However, the Allies had no intention of permitting the Nationalists to proceed with their plans. Accordingly, on March 15, 1920, an Allied army commanded by the British General Milne marched into Constantinople, proclaimed martial law, arrested as many Nationalist representatives as could be found and shipped some forty of them to Malta. Most of the Nationalists who had escaped arrest, including Kemal, repaired to the city of Ankara, there to set up a rump parliament under the name of the Grand National Assembly. When the sultan now convened another parliament at Constantinople, the country had two governing bodies: one subordinate to the sultan and maintained by Allied troops; the other supported by the National sentiment 561 of the Turkish people and protected by the desert and mountains separating Ankara from Constantinople and the Allied forces. The defiant Ankaran Assembly, on April 23, 1920, elected Mustapha Kemal Pasha as its president as well as commander in chief of the Nationalist Army. Not quite a year later, on January 21, 1921, this same body proclaimed Turkey a republic, and adopted a constitution which provided for responsible government. Meanwhile three Greek armies, with some British naval support, had driven the Nationalists out of. Thrace and pushed eastward into Anatolia as far as Ushaq. British support was soon withdrawn, however, when it was learned that the French and the Italians had no intention of enforcing by arms the unpopular Treaty of Sevres which had allotted Smyrna and the Ionian hinterland to the Greeks. Despite this setback, the Greeks opened up a new offensive which enabled them to reach the Sakharia River, only fifty miles from - Ankara, before the end of August 1921. Then the drive was spent and the Greeks were unable to make any further advance. From August 24 until September 16, the ill-equipped but inspired Turks, under the brilliant leadership of Mustapha Kemal, won the battle of Sakharia, and then began a counteroffensive which not only cleared the Greeks from the Ionian coastland, but threatened the reconquest of eastern Thrace and much of the former Turkish territory in the Balkan Peninsula. This change of fortune led to the armistice urged by the British and signed at Mudania 562 and later to the Treaty of Lausanne (July 24, 1923). Under the terms of this treaty, 'Turkey recovered all eastern Thrace as far west as the Maritza River, including the city of Adrianople (now Edirne). In addition, she was permitted to recover the bridgehead and railroad center on the west bank of the Maritza at Karagach. Constantinople was _restored as an integral part of the Turkish state, but the Zone of the Straits was demilitarized and opened to the ships of all nations, no matter what their cargo, in times of peace and when Turkey was neutral in times of war. In the event of 'Turkey's belligerency, enemy vessels might be kept out of the Straits, but not those of neutral countries. In the Aegean Sea, Turkey retained Imbros, Tenedos, and the Rabbit Islands, while Dodecanesia and Rhodes were ceded to Italy. Most of the remaining Aegean Islands went to Greece. 'Turkey gave up all claims to Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and the Arabian kingdoms, and recognized the British annexation of Cyprus. The unpopular rights of extra-territoriality were abolished, foreign control of customs was lifted, and no restrictions were placed on Turkey's military, naval, and air forces. A -supplementary Graeco-Turkish Convention provided for the compulsory exchange of Turkish subjects in Greece for Greek subjects in Turkey; and another stipulated the demilitarization of the Graeco-Bulgarian Turkish frontier in eastern Thrace. As a result of her successful war with the Greeks, the Turks were able to force the Allies to abrogate the hated and unpopular Treaty of Sevres and to accede to their claims as drawn in the popular Treaty of Lausanne. Turkey was left with an area of about 295,000 square miles, the size of Texas and South Carolina combined, and with a population (1923) of about 13,000,000. URSUANT to the terms of the Lausanne Treaty, the Turkish Nationalists began at once their program of expatriation. This involved the exchange of some 1,000,000 Greeks living in Ionia for some 400,000 Turks living in Greece. The actual process of this exchange involved untold suffering. It frequently was difficult to decide whether a family should be considered Turkish or Greek, particularly when the original migrations had taken place a century or more ago. Fraud and corruption were common, and official carelessness often resulted in the transplanting of mountaineers onto plains or the transference of plainsmen and farmers to the mountains. Under the brilliant leadership of President Mustapha Kemal Pasha (1923-1938), the following marked social and religious innovations of far-reaching significance were introduced: (1) the abolition of the sultanate; (2) the abolition of the Turkish caliphate (spiritual leadership of the Mohammedan world); (3) the abolition of Mohammedanism as the state religion of Turkey; (4) recognition of freedom of religion; (5) modification along Occidental lines of the Mohammedan ritual; (6) the enactment of a series of laws relating to the position of women, such as the abolition of polygamy, recognition of divorce, required civil marriages, abolition of the Oriental custom of wearing the veil, and the political emancipation of women; (7) 563 the abolition of capitulations or the rights 563 of extraterritoriality; (8) the adoption of civil, penal, and commercial law codes based on those of Switzerland, Italy, and Germany respectively; (9) compulsory school attendance for those between the ages of seven and sixteen with the result
that illiteracy has declined from eighty-five per cent to forty-two per cent; (11) the adoption of the Latin alphabet ? newspapers were ordered to abandon the old Arabic type and the publication of books printed in Arabic characters was strictly forbidden; (12) required teaching of the Turkish language in the new Latin script for all Turks under the age of forty ? certifications of literacy were demanded from all those who aspired to citizenship; (13) the  publication of an official dictionary containing 24,000 words, strictly Turkish in origin; (14) prohibition of the teaching of religion in public or private elementary schools; (15) the equipment of local community centers, called Halkevis, as centers of cultural propaganda;
(16) the adoption of the metric system; (17) the compulsory adoption of surnames (thus in 1934 Mustapha Kemal Pasha became Ataturk by vote of the Grand National Assembly ? a name meaning "Father of the Turks" and Ataturk in turn hose the surname of Inonu for Ismet
Pasha, to commemorate his victories in the Turkish War of Independence); and finally, (18) as a definite "symbol of intellectual liberation," the abolition of the wearing the fez or turban, the distinguishing mark of pious Moslems. Before the advent of the Nationalist revolution, relatively few Turks concerned themselves with trade, commerce, and industry. The masses generally preferred to labor in the fields. Hence business affairs became a monopoly of the other racial groups within the empire, particularly the Greeks, Jews, and Armenians.
But the Turkish Nationalists are determined to limit capital, labor, production, and ownership as
far as possible to native Turks. As a result, through government aid and encouragement, a commercial middle class has arisen, the nucleus of which is a group of Turkish refugees from Greece. Commercial treaties have been signed with Russia,
Great Britain, Italy, and the United States. In 1929, the National Assembly voted a huge appropriation for a twelve-year consolidated public-works program, including railway, port, irrigation, reclamation, and highway construction projects. Infant industries have been stimulated through a protective tariff system. These include textile factories, cotton gins, sugar refineries, and sawmills. Within three years after the inauguration of this program, the
value of Turkish manufactures increased from $20,000,000 to $50,000,000. Leading Turkish exports include tobacco, fruits, cereals and cotton, with increasing amounts of mineral products, including chrome ore, zinc, coal, copper, antimony 
and petroleum. There has been a tendency in Turkey, in the interests of efficiency, to establish state control over a number of industries. Thus the government today owns most of the railways and a large portion of the merchant marine. It also has monopolized the production of tobacco, gunpowder, salt, and alcoholic beverages. But the rural peasant classes have not been neglected. The government has subsidized agriculture by the free grant of cattle, plows, and even houses to deserving families. Agricultural production has been encouraged
further by material reduction of taxes and by a marked reduction of the term of military service required of the peasant class. The keynote of Turkey's foreign
policy is peace. Recently at the world's fair in New York, Western sightseers were impressed by the modern Turkish Pavilion that was dominated by the statue of a man who symbolized the New Turkey. The man stood with one foot on the shore of Turkey-in-Europe, the other on that of Turkey-in-Asia. Underneath were the words: "Turkey unites Europe and Asia, in Peace." To date (1944) this claim has been made good. Turkey remains today one of the few important
neutrals in Europe and Asia, although on August 2 of this year (1944), the Turkish Grand National Assembly, upon the recommendation of Premier Sukru Saracoglu, broke all diplomatic and economic relations with Germany, an action which quite likely will result in war. This much is certain, if the New Turkey of the future is to function as a first-rate power in Europe and Asia, the government must play a shrewd and cautious diplomatic game. It will be necessary, especially, to establish friendly relations with Russia, England, and Germany, for each of these countries will continue to have designs on the Straits ?bridgehead of Europe and Asia-Russia in order to obtain egress to the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas; England because of her strategic interests in Egypt, Suez, India, and Afghanistan; and Germany, in order to revive her Drang nach Osten policy toward Mesopotamia. A strong, vigorous, dignified foreign
and domestic policy will be needed. Turkey can no longer afford to survive 564 merely as the "Sick Man of Europe." In 1934, Turkey with Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Greece joined the so-called Balkan Pact, which guarantee Security of respective frontiers. In 1937, Turkey adhered to the Middle-Eastern Pact
with similar guarantees with her eastern neighbors Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. Thus Turkey has become the link between two interlocking alliances, the Balkan and the Middle-Eastern Ententes. In 1925, the Turkish government concluded a treaty of neutrality and non-aggression with Soviet Russia. This was renewed in 1930, and again in 1933. Similar treaties were concluded with Italy, Turkey, and the United States. In 1929 and 1931 this developed into most-favored nation treaties between these two countries. Turkey has been active in promoting the movement for Balkan Confederation. As a result of the recent Balkan Conferences,
which Turkish delegates have always attended, two positive results have
been achieved: (1) the establishment of an Inter-Balkan (Turkey, Greece, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia) Chamber of Commerce; and (2) an Inter-Balkan Tobacco Bureau. The changes wrought by the Turkish Nationalists in the development of their country have been truly astounding, but their task is far from ended. "We must work much more," said Premier Ismet Pasha, in 1931. ?We Must work a thousand years.? The Captain's Biggest Battle Sadie Willis Adamson IT was in the early summer. Captain William Andrews, a patient in a great eastern hospital, was experimenting with a wooden leg. Out on the large veranda were many soldiers both young and old? some with splints on their arms, some with splints on their legs. All were convalescing, home from the war. Some would go back overseas, back into the grim battle of death? but not Captain William Andrews. Inside the big hospital, nurses were rushing up and down the corridors with food trays. At: the moment the Captain was resting in a big chair in his room. His eyes followed the nurses but his mind was far away. A whiff of perfume from the flower box filled with petunias and geraniums drifted in with the slight breeze. A pretty nurse set a tray of food on a table at his side. "Mr. Steffan will be in to see you early this afternoon, Captain." Her smile was encouraging. Captain Andrews nodded, unsmiling, and sipped his postum. If she would only keep away from him. Her hair reminded him of Mazie. His Mazie he once thought, but war had fogged everything. He didn't want to think of Mazie. Time had been when he had held her in his arms. They had danced at college dances and Bill had been the team's best man. It had been only two hours since she had left his room. "Oh, Bill," she had exclaimed at sight of him. "I knew you would be okay." "But I won't hold you, Mazie," he had replied with such fierce irony that the girl had stepped back at his look and words. "No girl as lovely as you, should be tied to a wooden leg." At least not Mazie Barker, the Doctor's daughter. "But Bill darling, you don't understand." "I understand," he had assured her. "I'll not have any pity. In time you will forget." Then gently, "There will be others without a scar." "As if, oh, Bill, how can you?" "This must be your last visit. This is final. I'm leaving soon, anyway." For one long minute Mazie Barker had gazed at the man she loved, in painful acceptance, and, sobbing, quickly left the room. Andrews had known the pain and cruelty of war. But this bitterness was new. If he had not loved Mazie with heart and soul, he could have stood this handicap with the rest. But he loved her and it cut deep. His tray had been removed unnoticed. He sat there wondering what his next move should be. A shadow filled the doorway and Andrews looked up. "My name is Steffan." The man before him spoke with sincerity and interest. He held out his hand. "They told me of you when I was here last week. I'm driving out into the country. Want to come along?" "Thank you, sir. Ill be rather cumbersome until I get the hang of this." He placed his hand on the new leg and the shock of no feeling Page 565 566 shot a streak of red up to his temples. "You'll manage." confident and firm. They had gone probably three miles when Steffan remarked, "I like to drive out this way, the sights I see along the road feed my soul. I understand you were an electrician before the war?" "That's right, sir." "Like it?" "It was like food to me, sir." "Then I'll show you something, a sight for tired eyes." They had come to a turn in the road. "Over there," nodded Steffan, "is our power plant. The electrician in charge of it has made quite a name for himself. Yonder are the 'Timothy Falls where electricity is manufactured for the surrounding territory. "The Falls are lovely in their powdery whiteness surrounded by these mountains of rock with the green of lawn and flowers enhancing, if possible, their brilliant hue. "When I'm down in the dumps, I come out here and view nature for awhile, and every time I see something that builds my faith." "THEY had parked the car and now stood viewing the Falls. Andrew could find no words to offer. They walked on, his cane thumping the hard earth. They were on their way to the power plant. Not once did Steffan offer to help the man beside him. "Take a look at this oddity," suggested Steffan, pointing directly in front of them. Out there amid nature's magnificent beauty was a barkless, broken old tree apparently barren of life. Steffan was Two long,. Knotted old roots stretched over the surface of huge rocks, on either side of the weather. Beaten portion that was once a tree of life?their knotted, claw-like arms clasping the surface of barren rocks, prying into their depths, and disappearing out of sight under their heavy weight. Extending from a limb, apparently dead, Andrews gasped in astonishment at a spray of green (like a Christmas table decoration) gazing up at the sun and basking in its warmth, 'That old tree, courageously seeking, prying, gathered from the good earth the sap and nourishment with its breast to enable it to pierce through the rugged surface above, and reach the warm _health-giving light of the sun. "It's a pitiful struggle," exclaimed Steffan, "yet the conquering tree breathes a lesson in our everyday lives, 'Labor in order to grow.' 'Seek and ye shall find.' How long the old tree has battled the elements can never be learned, yet the simple truth defies crushing, and points that it can be done." "Faith is the word for it," observed Andrews. "Exactly," Steffan spoke with finality. "It burned a lesson on my conscious existence the first time I saw it." A lizard ran in front of them and disappeared behind a rock. "This is part of Nature's wonderland," declared Steffan. A few moments later they reached the power plant. The smooth, steady noise was music to Andrews' ears, and his quick eye gleamed with pleasure as Steffan pointed out different parts of interest. Back at the car, Steffan placed THE CAPTAIN'S BIGGEST BATTLE. His foot upon the running board. He drew up his trousers and thumped his wooden leg with his nuckles. ?It has served me well? he stated ?just as yours will you.? ?You too??? Andrews gasped. Ever since World War I,? Stefan spoke proudly. ?And if there?s a pretty girl in the picture so much the better. Once I was about to tell Janice I didn?t want her pity, that was once Janice is my wife now.? He shook his head, ?What I have done, you can do lad. I?d like to take a needed vacation soon and I?d appreciate your services. How about it?? Andrews was trying hard to control his quivering chin. ?I?ll give it all I?ve got, sir. Thank you, sir.? Back at the hospital Captain William Andrews called a number, and only joy was reflected in the conversation over the telephone. It was plain he was talking to someone he loved.

AN intelligent advocate of recognition of woman's equality with man in economic, political, and social fields was Miss Alice Lovina Manning of Salt Lake City, who recently passed away. She was the fourth woman admitted to the practice of law in Utah, was legislative chairman of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, and was in the law department of the Union Pacific Railroad. AFTER organizing successful national campaigns to persuade women to take war jobs, the head of the magazine bureau of the O. W. I. Resigned because of lack of proper conditions for caring for her two young children. She believes that the lack of community co-operation in arranging for the proper care of children of war-working mothers. Is a menace to all war industries. ELOISE S. THETFORD is coauthor with S. H.

The Federation of Women's Clubs in the United States is now sponsoring fourteen scholarships for Latin American girls to study here, ranging from board and room to $1200 each. Page 569 EDITORIAL 2 NO. 10 Home, After She War SSS HE three words "after the wat' have seemed for a long time to be merely wishful thinking, but now, when the end of the wat in Europe, at least, does seem in sight, it is time to plan for the home in the postwar of the most pressing situations to be faced will be the re turn of thousands of mothers to the home as the war work in which many of them have engaged will cease. The question of women remaining in the home to personally care for their children, or hiring someone else to care for them, or leaving them to improper or no supervision at all, is a problem which is plaguing the entire Nation. Theres no hard and fast rule which can be laid down in this regard, each case deserves serious consideration on its own merits as to the right and wrong of the reason which causes a mother to absent herself from the home?reasons which range from the situation arising from the death or injury of the husband, to the mother who wishes to help out with the family finances, and so on down the scale until one reaches the mother who, tiring of her domestic duties, simply walks out on her family. It is not the present intention to enter into a justification or condemnation of the mother who leaves the Page 570 home, but merely to point out the fact that the great majority, it ls hoped, of the men will be coming back; war industries will cease; and the returning members of the armed forces must be given the opportunity to once more earn livelihoods for themselves and their families. When this situation arises, the mother who has left her home should be prepared to face the situation and accept it. She may find that she can slip back into her place in the family with no friction, on the other hand she may find her children resentful of the closer surveillance to which they will be subjected. The mother who has worked night shift and whose adolescent children have been allowed to do much as they wished, may find her problem the most acute, if, indeed, heartbreaking situations do not already exist. The Latter-day Saint mother has been taught that parents shall "teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord." In November 1831 (in a. Day when the mother was in the home) the Lord said: Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them; and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, VOL 31 OCTOBER 1944 EDITORIAL but their eyes are full of greediness" (Doctrine and Covenants 68:31). Have the eyes of some in this day been so full of greediness that mothers have put in jeopardy the very souls of their children? If any mother feels the pricks of conscience over the behavior of her children, let her but the more eagerly, earnestly, and prayerfully reassume her duties. History teaches that a period of 571 lawlessness and excess follows after a war. As the industrial need for mothers decreases, the need of the mother, as such, will steadily increase. Where it is at all possible for the mother who may have left her home to return, she should eagerly accept the opportunity, and rededicate herself to carry on those duties, given her by the Lord, for which she is and will be held responsible.

Forward, Without Fear Dorothy Clapp Robinson CHAPTER THREE Who stole their money? That was the question facing ANN Kristin MORTENSEN and her sister Helga when they reached Camp Lewis across from Nauvoo. All the way from Norway there had been but a series of misfortunes for the orphan girls. Just before they discovered the loss of their money ANN Kristin had been knocked over, and her hand infected from a sliver. Matr Lewis, who had won Ann's dislike because he called her an over-decorated female, pulled the sliver from her hand and was very attentive until Parry Lov Turner, a girl from the South, told them ANN was going to marry Tom Beptor. Tom was an immigrant who had joined the Company at St. Louis. THE hour was the one before sundown. Low-hanging clouds deepened the spirit of depression that had hung over the camp all day. Insects buzzed incessantly. Instead of Niels and Johanna staying with the girls in a fine home in Nauvoo, the girls were staying with them in a shelter Niels had built on a high spot back of where the trunks had been unloaded. Several other shelters similar to Niels' had risen here and there about the grove. But this one was better. Niels had found his fellow countrymen, and had_ traded one of Helga's Norwegian blankets for a piece of canvas. The canvas served as a roof. Inside, they and their belongings were reasonably secure against the weather. In the clearing Helga and Johanna sat knitting. It was less hot there than by their shelter. As her needles clicked furiously, Helga thought nothing could lift the burden that Page 572 hung over her and Ann Kristin. Thief was such. An ugly word. To lose money was not as bad as having suspicion come between them and their friends. Johanna looked better. Shining through the weariness in her face was the light of peace. Before a tiny fire Patty Lou was breaking twigs., "Darn," she cried in exasperation. "All I get is a blaze. It won't smudge a bit. I think the skeeters must be having a convention here to welcome us. It makes our? Welcome to Zion complete." "I feel as if the end of the world were hanging over us." Helga stopped knitting and looked about. "There is a feeling of doom in the air." Johanna looked from one to the other. Their looks told what they were thinking. "All my life I have lived without money. It doesn't matter. We must think of the days ahead." Helga's needles clicked even faster. "I am thinking of nothing but them. After Niels buys us a camp oven we shan't have a dollar between us." "How did you-all learn such a jumpy language?" Patty Lou had looked up from her fire in wonder. "What did you-all say?" Helga translated and added, "Tomorrow we shall all have to hunt work." "Me? Work?" the girl cried. "I'm no account when it comes to working." FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR up quietly. Where is? Matt Lewis came "Good evening, girls. Niels?" "He went somewhere to buy us a camp oven. Did you need him?" "N?no. He was going across to Nauvoo with me," "Don't take him away," Patty Lou complained. "That no-count Jake left just when he might have been some use. He had money and he could build a smudge." "Let me." Matt reached for some leaves and moss and made a blanket of them over the blaze. Thick smoke rolled up. "Do tell!" the girl exclaimed. "All it needed was a man," Matt gave her directions for keeping it going. Then, rising, he looked about casually. "Where is your sister?" he asked, as if her absence had just occurred to him, "She went with Tom Bedloe. They should be back before long. Did you find anything?" "I couldn't even find that trader, Wilkins, but I will. Bedloe beat me to him. If Niels comes, send him to the wharf. As soon as I can, I will be back across. I may be able to find you a house.": "Don't look for one," Helga told him shortly. "Kristie will be getting marred and I will Stay here with Johanna." "Well, I will keep my eyes Open for a small house, and for work for you." He turned to go, and Patty Lou spoke in a half whisper to Helga, "Isn't that just like men? They all want the same gal, but Tom Bed. Loe will hold on to her." Helga started to reply, but stopped as a buggy drove to the edge of the clearing. It was Bedloe and Ann Kristin. He tied his team 573 and turned to help her, but she was already out and walking toward the others. Matt saw and came back. "What luck?" Helga asked. Ann Kristin did not answer, but her silence was more eloquent than words. Her face was drawn and pale, and she held her sore hand to shield it from any contact. Bedloe, coming up, answered for her. "Elder Lewis is still interviewing the immigrants. Captain Russell has put his crew through a third degree. It is more than likely that whoever took it left the boat before it docked." "How could that be?" Helga asked. "Easily," Matt answered. "The thief could have gone ashore in g small boat, or he could have left at one of the numerous times when the River Maid tied up to take on wood. Captain Russell will know who left the boat." "As a matter of fact," Bedloe spoke slowly, "only two men left the boat. Your father and the trader, Wilkins. The trader took a small satchel with him, and your father carried a box. A rather large box." "A box of tools delivered to a farmer immigrant," Matt said shortly. "You heard him Say so." "Of course, and everyone knows your father is the soul of honor." Matt stiffened. His mouth was an angry white line. Bedloe hastened to explain. "Situations of this kind must be handled without sentiment. Other. Wise the thief will never be found. Those who are innocent have nothing to fear. We have filed a com. Plaint with the local authorities stat. Ing the facts as we know them." He turned to Helga. "Ann Kristin and 574 I are being married tonight. She can't stay in this camp another night.". They all looked at Ann Kristin. Matt bit his lower lip. Her face was flushed. Either, he thought, because she is excited or because she is feverish from her hand. She doesn't love the big "wind-bag." Helga asked, "Has Elder Lewis given his consent?" Before she could answer, Bedloe spoke. "The essential thing right now is to get her under a roof. Her hand is paining her. Would you like to go with us to Bishop Palmer's?" He asked the last of the three women. Patty Lou's face was bland. "Let me think. It seems like I can re member?" "Will an hour be enough time? I can be back then. We will get your trunks tomorrow." Bedloe turned his back on Patty Lou and spoke to his fiancee. But Matt's face lighted with interest. The Southern girl was always remembering something. Just what was it she knew, if anything? He started to ask, but stopped as his father and Niels came into the clearing. LARGE drops of rain, vanguard of the storm to come, spattered about them. The sky had darkened, but there was still light enough to show the lines of weariness and discouragement in Elder Lewis' face. Ann Kristin's hand throbbed and her head ached. For the moment she wished her father had never seen a missionary. It had brought them nothing but misery. She couldn't get away from this place fast enough. "It was no use." Elder Lewis saw the inquiry in the glances turned to him. "I didn't find out any more today than I did yesterday. But | am not giving up." "Neither am I," Bedloe's voice was harsh. "There is entirely too much of this going on. Make an example and it will stop, I found out today that many complaints have been filed. More than I ever suspected. The reason it goes on?." "The reason it goes on," Matt interrupted, "is because the country is full of slick vultures who prey on innocent?." He broke off. His fingers itched to choke something out of Tom Bedloe's face. For no reason he could name, he hated him. "Ann Kristin and I are being married tonight." Bedloe turned to Lewis. "I hope we have your blessing." It took a moment for Elder Lewis to switch his thoughts to this new situation. "Tonight? 'This is very sudden, isn't it, Ann?" "Yes Elder Lewis, it is sudden, but we thought under the circumstances?.": "Yes, It is evident you must have help and I can do nothing for you." "I?ll go on," Bedloe told the girl. "I have an errand but I will be back in an hour." The buggy had no more than turned when they noticed two men approaching. One wore an officer's badge and both had guns. The leader looked them over insolently. "Which one of you is Edward Lewis?" "I am. Now what?" "At least you are honest enough to admit it. My name is Simmons and this is Jones with me. Mr. Lewis, I am arresting you in the name of the law." FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 575 "What do you mean?" Matt demanded.'' Just what I said. I am arresting Edward Lewis for the willful appropriation of money belonging to two immigrant girls. We are swamped with such complaints. You Mormons give us more trouble than all the rest of the people. I?ll be glad when we get rid of you." Matt faced the men belligerently. ''Are you crazy? You can't arrest a man on some flimsy excuse, and with no evidence." "Oh, I can't, eh?" Simmons drew a paper from his pocket. "Here is the warrant." "But he had nothing to do with the disappearance of their money." "That is something for the judge to decide. I was sent here for him, and I am taking him." The man, Jones, grinned, showing broken and discolored teeth. "He'll have a chance to explain what he carried in the box he took off the River Maid. Maybe he'll have a little trouble explaining where he got the money to bring this bunch of furriners up the river." "Just how do you know," Matt demanded, "that he paid their way? How do you know they didn't pay their own passages?" "Did they? Ask him. Ask him if he didn't. We got ways of finding out. Why he'd give a hoot about doing it is beyond me. That is an-other queer thing about you Mormons. "There was such assurance in his voice they turned automatically to face Edward Lewis. His look of be-wilderment changed to relief. He smiled at them. "Yes, I did pay their passage. That is, I paid a large part of it; but that isn't a crime. You can't arrest me forth at. " "And you had only seven dollars when you left here. Try denying that." Every eye turned to Patty Lou. Her face was scarlet. Then Edward Lewis spoke again. "I have no intention of denying it. I had exactly seven dollars in gold when I left." "Yet you paid a hundred, two hundred, maybe three hundred dollars, and had enough . l eft to buy your wife a present in Montrose." Matt was taut with rage. He want-ed to shake Patty Lou until her teeth in her empty head rattled. She didn't have sense enough to know any idle word would be picked up by their enemies. But she could not have sworn out the complaint. "Try denying you took a box ashore?."I think you had better tell them, Father, how you got the money for the passage, and what was in the box you took to Elijah Lize n bee. " " I don?t know what was in the box. I didn't open it. Moses Lizen-bee died on the trip up, and I promised to deliver the box to his broth-er. He said it was tools." "But it could have been gold taken from a trunk." "No. It could not." "How did you get the passage money? Probably by a miracle," the deputy smiled facetiously. "I hear some of you work them. Come to think of it, it was a miracle to get that money and not be found out until now." "Even if he took that money in New Orleans, you couldn't arrest him here just on suspicion," Matt cried hotly. But, even as he said it, he 576 knew there was no use to protest. They could and would hold him on any pretext whatever. Edward Lewis looked about the group. Johanna's eyes were brimming with tears. Helga and Ann Kristin were shocked, but Patty Lou's face showed guilt. "Captain Russell gave me free passage if I would bring the saints back on his boat. This group," he hesitated, reluctant to go on, "this group was made up mostly of people left by other companies. Because of sickness or lack of money, they had been left behind. Yet I had to et them here." "But your Church didn't give you money. I reckon you prayed about it." "Yes, I did pray. While waiting I went into a free reading room in New Orleans." He turned and his next words were to Matt alone. "It was a pleasant room with carpet and curtains, and strongly reminiscent of our former life. My heart went out. To your mother. She has missed her home so much. There was a beautiful lamp on the table with porcelain bowl and shade. That is why. I bought the lamp. Life here is so devoid of comforts and beauty." The officer opened his mouth to speak but, with an imperative gesture, Ann Kristin silenced him. 'Tears were running down her cheeks. "Go on, Elder Lewis," she said quietly. Matt gave her a quick look. "I was at my wit's end. I prayed many times. As I left the room after spending the evening reading, my eye caught a notice on the wall. It gave the address of a place one could buy a lottery ticket." Matt spoke quickly. "So that is where you got the money." "Yes, Son. I tried to put that notice out of my mind but it stayed with me. I walked the streets for hours, and when I went to bed, I prayed that my mind would be turned from such sinful practices. When I awoke the next morning, I was very strongly impressed to go back and buy a ticket. So I went to the place." The officers were smiling broadly. "And your ticket won?" Simmons said. Ignoring him, Elder Lewis went on. "When I tried to buy a ticket they were sold out." "Sold out?" Patty Lou echoed. "Yes, but a man seeing my disappointment offered to sell me half of his. I hear that is a practice with those who follow the races. I paid him three dollars for half of his ticket." "And your ticket won?" "Our ticket won. After buying passage for the saints who needed help, I had seven dollars left. 'The exact amount I had when I left home." Matt's face in the deepening dusk shone with pride and devotion. Tears were in the girls' eyes. Something was happening to Ann Kristin. It was for such things her father had left home and comfort, friends and business. The men were taking it as a joke. "That is a fancy story all night. You can come and tell it to the judge, and you still have to explain about the box you took from the River Maid." Matt's muscles tightened. He knew what justice his father would get with such a story. "You said you had a warrant. Who signed the complaint?" FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR Very deliberately Simmons opened the paper, and read, "Miss Ann Kristin Mortensen, lately of?." Like a bombshell the name exploded over the small group. Helga grasped her sister's arm. It was the sore one, but neither noticed. "Kristie, you didn't?you couldn't?." "Certainly, I didn't," Ann Kristin answered, then suddenly she paled. "Oh-oh-Tom, I?." "Please." Matt's voice cut like the lash of a whip. "Don't. Make excuses. We all know you didn't know what you were doing." "But I didn't. I didn't know?." "Come on." Simmons took handcuffs from his pocket. Edward Lewis made no protest. Matt and Niels would have interfered, but he motioned them back. ' "Force will not settle this. Explain to mother. I will be out in a few days." "T will tell her." Ann Kristin's eyes were dark with fright. "I will tell her the truth. She will believe me." Helga was still staring at her sister. "Kristie. How could you? And I thought it was Patty Lou. She looked so guilty.". "Well," the girl's gulp of relief made even Matt smile. "I talk so much I thought maybe I really had told something this time. Phew! What a scare!" Then, suddenly, the entire group was galvanized by a wild scream. They all turned to face the trail. "Pa, Pa, Matt!" It was Ted's shrill voice. He burst into the clearing, but stopped short at sight of the strangers, "Oh, my gosh!" Matt stepped quickly to his side. "What is it, Ted? What's the matter?" 577 "I~I was at the piet?helping look for the money?and?and?" "Yes. Yes. What is it?" "Two men came in a boat. They were in an awful hurry. They said?," he stopped suddenly and looked from Matt to his father, and back, "It couldn't be true, could it?" "What couldn't be true?" "He's dead. There was some kind of signal. They killed him." Matt's height lengthened and tightened. Edward Lewis groaned aloud. Disregarding the officers, he moved quickly to his small son's side. "Tell us quietly. Take your time." Ted was trying hard to be tall and quiet like Matt. "The men were scared. They said, 'get to your homes and your guns.' They said, 'the Mormons will kill us.' " "Who is dead?" Patty Lou demanded. Ted's nerves snapped. He started to cry. "I told you, the Prophet and a whole pile of others, and we are all going to be killed." At the first note of alarm, Simmons had drawn his gun. Jones. Visibly nervous, followed his lead. The saints looked at each other in horror and unbelief. Insects droned loudly in the silence. Then Edward Lewis straightened his shoulders. "The end has come." There was no answer except Johanna's quiet sobbing. Helga had translated quickly for them. Then in two strides, Matt was facing Simmons. "Don't come any nearer," Simmons raised his gun. "I'll shoot." Ignoring the gun, Matt stepped close and shook his fist in the other's face. "Take my father. Put him in (Continued on page 584) Sketch Of My Life Eliza R. Snow Smith CHAPTER VIII ALTHOUGH two Hospitals, St. Mark's and St. Mary's had been established in Salt Lake City by their respective religious denominations, the Latter-day Saints felt the need of one of their own where the sick and maimed, who desired, could have the sacred ordinances of anointing with oil and laying on of hands administered without being exposed to the contempt and ridicule of those who ignored
them. But the means, labors, and attention of our people being necessarily directed in so many
channels, that in cases in which Hospital appliances were indispensably requisite for the alleviation of suffering humanity, we patronized those in operation. Leading "Mormon" women have, from time to time, suggested that we make a move in the direction of a Hospital of our own, but without location, building, and without funds, to start out in an enterprise of such
magnitude seemed preposterous even to the most sanguine. At one time, President Young proposed to me, if I would take charge, and preside over the Institution, he would donate a certain Lot, on which was a moderately sized house, for the commencement of a Hospital, of
which he would give a warrantee deed for that purpose. But at that time my labors and responsibilities were such as rendered it an utter impossibility for me to accept the proposal
Page 578 and, as he declined entrusting it to another, the generous offer passed from our reach; but the want of a Hospital of our own grew more apparent year by year until in 1881-2,
when in the minds of several "Mormon" women it was settled as a necessity, and the idea was coincided in by some of the leading men. In the Spring following, the "Catholic Sisters," who for seven years had conducted St. Mary's Hospital on premises which they rented, were going to vacate them, which suggested an opportunity for us to obtain the place by paying rent as
they had done. After consulting the First Presidency and other prominent brethren with regard to the feasibility of the undertaking, and receiving encouragement respecting means for that purpose; it was decided for the L.D. Saint women to inaugurate a Hospital. Accordingly
an organization was formed, entitled "Deseret Hospital Association"? consisting of a Board of Directors- House Surgeon? Matron? etc., etc., and I was required to preside, which
although acknowledging the honor conferred, I accepted with the greatest reluctance? reluctance that approached nearly to obstinacy. I saw at once that we were grasping a
Mammoth? that as we had to commence at the bed-rock? build-additions, make repairs in the building, and fit up in every department, much thought, labor, and time must be devoted in that direction. I realized the great need, and the importance of the movement, and did not feel to shrink from my labor or responsibility, but when my time was all occupied, as it truly was at that time; for me to involve myself in other and untried duties, seemed nothing short of subscribing to neglect of those already resting upon me: but I obtained a promise that
after the Hospital was in good running order, I might resign. THE DESERET HOSPITAL
In connection with the ''Board of Directors," which consisted of ten ladies, I spent very much time? calling, and attending Board meetings?consulting, etc. etc. and succeeded beyond our most sanguine anticipations. Although many of our patients were unable to pay expenses
for treatment, by liberal donations we were enabled to fit up the building, supply each department, and pay our work-hands, nurses, etc. etc. But our remuneration consisted in
the consciousness of doing our duty, and in the sweet enjoyment which follows extending relief to suffering humanity? not one of us received one cent for our services? we were not hirelings, dollars and cents, with us personally, were out of the question. I retained the position of President nearly two years, when I resigned, and Bishop H. B. Clawson succeeded me, retaining the original Board. And here I must say, that my associations with the members
of that Board, in the struggles, labors, trials, and success, in starting out in a new direction, have very strongly endeared them to me, I trust never to be severed from my affections. Since my resignation as President of the "Hospital Association," I have 580 had no time to be idle. Visiting associations, organizing, etc.?officiating in sacred ordinances in the "House of the Lord" ?administering to the sick?writing for publication ?proof-reading, in connection with an extensive correspondence and other et ceteras, keep me fully employed. And, at this period of my life, to be able to perform the many duties, and labors of love required of me, is certainly worthy of a higher tribute of gratitude to God, the Giver of all good, than I am capable of expressing. ?Thus closes "Sketch of My Life" E.

A Short Story Based on an Incident in the Life of a Convert of 1842
Leslie L. Sudweeks
THE warm October sun was sinking low in the west that autumn day in 1835, as the old-fashioned surrey rounded a turn in the road, and the three occupants came in sight of the little hamlet nestling at the foot of Bear Mountain.
"Well, here we are almost home," said Joel Drury cheerfully, reining in his span of bay mares. "Tired, Permelia?"
The girl stirred haltingly, her large deep blue eyes and framed with a mist of curly black hair. Her delicate girlish figure was graceful in spite of the crutches which she kept near her on the seat.
Before supper was over there came a timid knock on the door, and in came Emma Woodward, Permelia's best friend, to hear all about the trip to the city and to spend the night.
As the years passed, Permelia Drury blossomed into young womanhood. Her cheerful acceptance of her lot, and her activity, in spite of her handicap, were marveled at by the little community of Wendell. Many happy hours were spent in company with her friend Emma,
did not uncover her eyes. The monotonous rattle of the carriage wheels seemed to echo over and over again the doctor's words: "I am sorry, Mrs. Drury, but medical science can do nothing for your daughter. Hip disease is incurable."
It was dark when the surrey finally pulled up at the little Massachusetts farmhouse that the Drury's called home. Sister Ruth had a candle burning in the window and a hot supper ready, while Brother Charles was just coming in from the milking.
The welcome warmth of the living room fire rapidly dispelled the gloom and disappointment which had settled over Permelia Drury. The lines around her mouth softened, revealing a lovely face set with girl of perhaps thirteen or fourteen, one arm encircling a pair of crutches. "Poor child, it was a great disappointment to her that the doctors in Boston could do nothing."
"Yes, poor dear," answered Thirza Drury softly. "It's so sad to know that she must go through life a cripple. Hip disease is such a tragic thing. But our daughter is brave, Joel, she will make the best of it."
Then, turning toward the huddled figure on the back seat of the surrey, she raised her voice slightly: "Look, Permelia. Wake up, dear! We are almost home."
The girl stirred haltingly, murmuring an incoherent, "Uh-huh," but
