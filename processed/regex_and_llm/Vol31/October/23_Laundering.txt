Laundering Claire P. Dorius A survey of home laundry methods by the State of Washington says, "Tuesday is recommended for wash day since maximum production is attained on that day, and. Since laundering is recognized as a heavy household task." Some homemakers prefer to wash often by dividing the clothes logically?bath towels and bed clothes, one day; dish towels and table linen and clothing another; fussier things a day to themselves. Others prefer to wash all the clothes in one day. The amount of hot water available is a determining factor. Hard water presents a problem because of the sticky curd that forms and clings to the clothes. The degree of hardness in the water will determine the amount of softener to use. Trisodium phosphate is gaining in popularity, and is splendid: to use for cleaning purposes as well as laundering. Do not use too much. It can be purchased by the pound at almost any paint store. It is important that the softener be added and dissolved before soap or clothes are put in. Most washing machines hold from twelve to sixteen gallons of water. Experts tell us that a sufficient amount of soap will make a suds two to three inches deep on the top of the water. Do not overload the washer?six to eight pounds are considered a good average load. It is always safer to remove stubborn spots and stains before washing. Rips and tears are more quickly mended before going into the washer. Remember that "a stitch in time saves nine." Soaking in warm softened water, to which enough soap has been added to make a light suds, helps to remove stains and loosens the soil, saves time, and lessens wear. Do not soak colored clothes unless colors are known to be fast, and then not over twenty minutes. To Wash For white clothes use water so hot the hand cannot be held in it.. For colored clothes use water comfortably warm to the touch. Do not wash too long. Over washing may redistribute the dirt in the clothes and make them gray. Rinsing Rinse clothes thoroughly in plenty of clear, hot, soft water. Soft water in the rinse is more important than in the wash. Follow the hot rinse with a lukewarm rinse. The warm rinse may be followed by a cold rinse with or without bluing. Bluing clothes is optional. It makes white clothes which have become yellowed, whiter. Great care must be used in the use of bluing to prevent streaks. Line the clothes basket with oilcloth or a muslin cover. The ink from newspapers is apt to soil the clothes. Bleaches It has been found that bleaches play two important roles in laundering?they keep white cottons and linens from becoming dull and gray. And they remove many stains. Contrary to a general belief, they keep colored cottons and linens clear and bright, provided, of course, the colors Page 593 594 are resistant to soap and water. The improper use of bleach has lead to the belief that it "eats the clothes." Good Housekeeping Institute recommends that it be added to the washing suds rather than to the rinsing water, and measured accurately 1 tablespoon to each gallon of water. Rinse until all odor is removed. Another laboratory recommends that if clothes have already been grayed by the use of hard water and insufficient soap, they may be brought back to their original whiteness as follows: Add 3 cupfulls cheap white vinegar to a tubful of water. Soak the garments in this water until the soap curds have been completely softened. Washing Rayons When the tag says "washable," that means a "go-ahead" signal to wash the garment when it is soiled. It will not need much 'special pampering. Better results have been obtained when rayons have been washed in lukewarm water. Do not soak rayons before washing. When you wash your rayons by hand, make a rich suds and squeeze the dress in it until it is clean. Squeeze out as much water as possible, then roll the garment in a clean bath towel and press out the excess moisture. When rayons are washed in the machine, the washing time must be short, three to four minutes and two minutes to each rinse. Rayons should never be allowed to dry completely before ironing. Many rayons such as spun rayon, rayon sheers, and linen?like weaves and jerseys?iron best when they are almost dry. However. Dresses made entirely of acetate rayon need to be quite wet when ironed. Never use a hot iron. Rayon is not an elastic fiber. Hanging Clothes on the Line Hang clothes on the straight of the goods by their bands, if possible, on a clean line with clean pins. Stretch smooth and pin securely in three or four places. When dry, remove clothes from the line in a systematic way. Fold the straight pieces before placing in the basket to avoid wrinkles and to save time later. Avoid unnecessary bending when hanging clothes. Don't stoop every time you pick up a garment from a basket. Put your clothes basket on a bench or stool, or better yet, use a child's wagon which can be pulled to where you need it. If possible hang clothes outdoors?the white and light colored pieces in the sunlight, and the colored pieces in the shade.
