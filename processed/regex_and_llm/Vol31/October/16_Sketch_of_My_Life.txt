Sketch Of My Life Eliza R. Snow Smith CHAPTER VIII ALTHOUGH two Hospitals, St. Mark's and St. Mary's had been established in Salt Lake City by their respective religious denominations, the Latter-day Saints felt the need of one of their own where the sick and maimed, who desired, could have the sacred ordinances of anointing with oil and laying on of hands administered without being exposed to the contempt and ridicule of those who ignored
them. But the means, labors, and attention of our people being necessarily directed in so many
channels, that in cases in which Hospital appliances were indispensably requisite for the alleviation of suffering humanity, we patronized those in operation. Leading "Mormon" women have, from time to time, suggested that we make a move in the direction of a Hospital of our own, but without location, building, and without funds, to start out in an enterprise of such
magnitude seemed preposterous even to the most sanguine. At one time, President Young proposed to me, if I would take charge, and preside over the Institution, he would donate a certain Lot, on which was a moderately sized house, for the commencement of a Hospital, of
which he would give a warrantee deed for that purpose. But at that time my labors and responsibilities were such as rendered it an utter impossibility for me to accept the proposal
Page 578 and, as he declined entrusting it to another, the generous offer passed from our reach; but the want of a Hospital of our own grew more apparent year by year until in 1881-2,
when in the minds of several "Mormon" women it was settled as a necessity, and the idea was coincided in by some of the leading men. In the Spring following, the "Catholic Sisters," who for seven years had conducted St. Mary's Hospital on premises which they rented, were going to vacate them, which suggested an opportunity for us to obtain the place by paying rent as
they had done. After consulting the First Presidency and other prominent brethren with regard to the feasibility of the undertaking, and receiving encouragement respecting means for that purpose; it was decided for the L.D. Saint women to inaugurate a Hospital. Accordingly
an organization was formed, entitled "Deseret Hospital Association"? consisting of a Board of Directors- House Surgeon? Matron? etc., etc., and I was required to preside, which
although acknowledging the honor conferred, I accepted with the greatest reluctance? reluctance that approached nearly to obstinacy. I saw at once that we were grasping a
Mammoth? that as we had to commence at the bed-rock? build-additions, make repairs in the building, and fit up in every department, much thought, labor, and time must be devoted in that direction. I realized the great need, and the importance of the movement, and did not feel to shrink from my labor or responsibility, but when my time was all occupied, as it truly was at that time; for me to involve myself in other and untried duties, seemed nothing short of subscribing to neglect of those already resting upon me: but I obtained a promise that
after the Hospital was in good running order, I might resign. THE DESERET HOSPITAL
In connection with the ''Board of Directors," which consisted of ten ladies, I spent very much time? calling, and attending Board meetings?consulting, etc. etc. and succeeded beyond our most sanguine anticipations. Although many of our patients were unable to pay expenses
for treatment, by liberal donations we were enabled to fit up the building, supply each department, and pay our work-hands, nurses, etc. etc. But our remuneration consisted in
the consciousness of doing our duty, and in the sweet enjoyment which follows extending relief to suffering humanity? not one of us received one cent for our services? we were not hirelings, dollars and cents, with us personally, were out of the question. I retained the position of President nearly two years, when I resigned, and Bishop H. B. Clawson succeeded me, retaining the original Board. And here I must say, that my associations with the members
of that Board, in the struggles, labors, trials, and success, in starting out in a new direction, have very strongly endeared them to me, I trust never to be severed from my affections. Since my resignation as President of the "Hospital Association," I have 580 had no time to be idle. Visiting associations, organizing, etc.?officiating in sacred ordinances in the "House of the Lord" ?administering to the sick?writing for publication ?proof-reading, in connection with an extensive correspondence and other et ceteras, keep me fully employed. And, at this period of my life, to be able to perform the many duties, and labors of love required of me, is certainly worthy of a higher tribute of gratitude to God, the Giver of all good, than I am capable of expressing. ?Thus closes "Sketch of My Life" E.
