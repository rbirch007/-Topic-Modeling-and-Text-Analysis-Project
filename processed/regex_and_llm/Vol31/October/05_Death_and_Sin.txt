DEATH AND SIN 549 The idea of death and the means of it would seem not to be of primary importance. The spiritual state of preparedness for it when it comes is all-important. The Lord has said: "And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them" (Doc. and Cov. 42:46).
This last quoted statement comes from a Section largely devoted to temporal admonition with promises for conformance. But it makes very clear that there are times when death may not be averted, for the Lord counsels respecting the sick: "And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed" (Doc. and Cov. 42:48).
Thus it is evident that the righteous as well as the wicked must die. When the time for that change comes even faith may not avert it. This is not to say that men may not die before an appointed time nor that death is to be sought for. Obviously, by violating the laws of health or even by his own hand man may hasten death. But it does not follow that because a man dies it is the result of his sin. There is no more reason for supposing that death on the field of battle is evidence of individual misdeeds than if death resulted from any manner of illness or from so-called natural causes.
The soldier on the field of battle is there under command or compulsion. If he dies prematurely no fault can attach to him. That responsibility rests with the instigators of the conflict. He may be as clean and as worthy and as well prepared to die as those who die from other causes, in which event his loved ones have the consoling assurance of God himself that death "shall be sweet to him." As Paul stated it: "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory" (I Cor. 15:54).
