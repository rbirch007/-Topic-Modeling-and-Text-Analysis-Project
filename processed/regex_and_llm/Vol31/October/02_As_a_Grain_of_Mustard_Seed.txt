AS A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED
sometimes at the Woodward farm and sometimes at the Drury's.
When Emma was finally sent away to Boston to a girls' finishing school, Permelia was very lonely. However, during the winter of 1841-42 this loneliness was partially offset by a new interest. Two missionaries had arrived from Nauvoo, preaching a strange, new religion called Mormonism.
The Woodwards and the Drurys were sturdy folk who were not accustomed to accepting new religious theories, yet there was something strangely appealing in the story of the modern prophet who had translated a book from an ancient record of golden plates, whose hiding place in the ground had been revealed by an angel. It seemed too incredible to be true, and yet the story was disconcerting.
The strange new book, purporting to give the record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of America, was weird at first seriously; later with the conviction that it must be the truth. The Woodwards finally sent for Emma to come home from Boston to hear this strange new doctrine, and Permelia was overjoyed at the prospect of discussing the teachings of Mormonism with her friend.
ON the afternoon of February 28, two elders busied themselves in throwing up a dam across the brook that meandered through the Woodward farm, in order to form a pond for the baptism on the morrow.
Permelia came over early to watch the work and to spend the night at the Woodwards. The two
strange new gospel they had both decided to embrace.
"Surely," said Permelia, "the Lord has again spoken from the heavens as was prophesied by John the Revelator."
"I am convinced of it," replied Emma thoughtfully. "Do you remember the incident related by the missionaries last Sunday, how in the early days at Nauvoo when many of the saints were stricken with malaria, Joseph Smith went among them healing the sick? Even Brother Elijah Fordham, who was thought to be breathing his last, was raised from his bed and immediately made whole."
"Yes," said Permelia, "and then Wilford Woodruff healed two children who were non-members by merely wiping their faces with the handkerchief of the Prophet. Truly this must be the Lord's work, for Jesus said, 'If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.'"
The morrow dawned clear and bright. As the two girls dressed and ate their breakfast, they were thrilled with anticipation of the coming event. At ten o'clock a little group of perhaps twenty converts and friends assembled at the appointed place on the Woodward farm.
The dam which had been built across the brook the previous day had backed the water up into a fairsized pond, perhaps three feet deep, which was now covered by a thin coating of ice. After a brief service on the low bank, the officiating elder 584 waded into the pond, broke up the ice, and threw it out on the bank. When Permelia?s name was called, she hobbled over to the edge of the pond, handed her crutches to Emma, and was carried down into the water in the strong arms of the officiating elder. The sudden shock of the icy water made her gasp. She stifled the impulse to scream, and in a few seconds began to feel warmer. The officiating elder raised his right arm and uttered a short, simple prayer. Then she felt herself tipped swiftly backward. As the icy waters closed over her head, she thought of that event 1800 years before when Jesus of Nazareth set the example by being baptized of John in the River Jordan. As Permelia Drury came up out of the water, she no longer felt the cold, and a strange sense of power surged through her body. Brushing aside the friendly arms extended to assist her, she walked out upon the bank unaided, exclaiming as she did so, "Oh, Emma, I can walk! I can walk!" There was great rejoicing among the little group of converts over the miracle which they had witnessed. The incident created a sensation in the community. Pressed for an explanation, the doctors attributed the healing to the shock of the icy water, and when asked why they did not apply the same treatment, merely shrugged and said they were afraid it might prove fatal. In the following years, Permelia Drury married Laban Morrill, migrated to Utah with a pioneer company, and raised a family of nine children, but never again resorted to her crutches.

"As for you, I'll get even with you if it takes the rest of my life." "Phew!" Patty Lou whistled ?We sure are fanning us Up a breeze." Then unexpectedly, she dropped to the ground and burst into wild sobbing. "Everybody's gone. Papa's gone, and Jake and now him." As if her sobs were a signal, the storm that had been threatening burst upon them. Lightning cut the deepening gloom. Sudden violent rain pelted them, carrying a chilling omen of what was to come. Ann Kristin's throbbing arm was forgot: ten in the deeper throbbing of pain in her heart. Was there no peace anywhere? (To be continued ) Let Us Take The Time Margaret E. Maslin ONE morning, a friend whom I seldom see, due to our heavy family cares and the distance between our homes, walked in my door with her two youngest children. What a pleasure it was to see her, yet I couldn't repress a sigh of weariness, thinking of the day's work piled up, 4 child just over the measles, and another fretful with Much as 1 would enjoy 4 whole day's visit, the shirked work would be almost more than I could manage before suppertime, weakened as I was from a month's illness and from nursing My sick husband and four children, with the worthy and prospective tasks incident to nursing another very sick baby. But my friend soon cheered me as I strove to make her comfortable. "I haven't come to sit and talk, but to work," she exclaimed vigorously, as she took out an apron from her bag and tied it on. So, while I cared for my sick baby, with the other children playing happily in the kitchen, this good friend eased my load, ironing, sewing, and doing dishes, while we snatched all-too brief moments to talk. She is a Relief Society counselor. A devoted wife, and the mother of two children. She mothers two others, and often opens her home to expectant mothers who have need of the sweet care she can give. She takes time to do out of her way to help not only her friends, but strangers as well. - How many of us can say we follow that and to go. Low such an example of the true spirit of the Relief Society sister? Isn't it too true that most of us say, "when I have time"? How often do we deliberately "take time," or "go out of our way," to do kind helpful things? Truly we mean to, we "just are too rushed" to stop a moment and think of something we can do for another when we go to town, to the store, or to visit. Time won't wait for us and we may, in the end, find regrets that will take more toll of our time and strength than the little things we could have up and done. A woman I know in good health widowed, whose children are grown up and gone, goes from house to house bemoaning her lonely existence: "No one need could help someone and be wanted." She sees mothers overburdened by illness and cares while she sits and talks and talks and talks. Criticizing their methods, "Now, when I was nursing etc." the present In which she plays no part, except for speaking of her lack of friends, of not being wanted, nor needed. Never does she lift a finger to prove her reiterated desire to help. If she is pinned down to proving her sincerity, she has an errand suddenly remembered, or the mending "isn?t worth doing, throw it away." She is pathetic, yes, but profits neither herself not those she visits, and there are others like her, though (Continued on page 608) Page 585 NOTES FROM THE FIELD Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of materials for 'Notes From the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104. RELIEF SOCIETY WAR AND WELFARE SERVICES IN MISSIONS IN the August issue of the Magazine reports of war and welfare services by Relief Societies in various stakes were presented. In this issue similar reports from missions are featured. These "Notes from the Field" for both August, and October and the two following issues in which war and welfare reports will be continued are to be considered as supplementary and high-lighting the summary of these services for the organization as a whole, which appeared in the annual report for 1943 in the July issue of the Magazine. Argentine Mission KATE M. BARKER, recently released president of the Argentine Mission Relief Society, reported in a letter dated May 1, 1944: "Last year the Relief Societies had a project for increasing their funds. They knit sweaters for the Swiss Government for their soldiers and received four pesos ($2) for each pullover. The Swiss Government furnished the yarn. They are continuing this year. Some of the Societies, with the money earned, paid the tuition for young girls who had to work to take courses in sewing. Page 586 "At the time of the San Juan earthquake they certainly responded wonderfully?contributing forty-two articles of clothing, mostly dresses they had made or remodeled." South African Mission Josephine H. FOLLAND, retiring president of Relief Societies of the South African Mission, wrote February 1, 1944: "We feel we have had a very successful year, both spiritually and financially. With respect to financial matters, it has been _ our most successful year. In spite of all the war efforts that, of course, are continually going on, we were able to raise here in our Mowbray Branch over $400 at our annual bazaar; and most of the other Societies have a substantial balance on hand to work with during the coming year and for any emergencies that may arise. "Almost all our members have actively participated in some war services along with Relief Society work, such as Red Cross canteen and auxiliary work, and as blood donors, etc. We have one good sister, Charlotte M. Hancock, who is unable to attend regular Relief Society meetings as there is no organization in the Durban Branch, but she has NOTES FROM THE FIELD completed 129 articles for Red Cross 587 (including pajamas, hospital gowns, vests, shirts, etc.) and also she has made seventy-five visits in giving compassionate service to the sick, homebound, and bereaved. ?Here in Cape Town we are fortunate to have an American Service Club and, up until a few months ago, we have had a number of Americans stop here, a few Mormon boys among them. Needless to say we were overjoyed in seeing them and
entertaining them at the mission home. I have been given the job of secretary of the Club and also have charge of it one day a week along with my two eldest daughters who help out as hostesses in the Club. ''As manpower in some of the
branches is scarce, especially here in Cape Town, the Relief Society sisters have had additional duties and privileges such as speaking in Sunday evening services and representing the branch, as well as the Relief Society, in their visiting teaching. "I have had the privilege of visiting the six other branches of the mission where there are organized Relief Societies, and they all express
their appreciation for Relief Society work and also the wonderful lessons and articles in the Magazine. We have fifty-five subscriptions to the Magazine with all the new officers for the coming year as subscribers, and two of the branches, Pretoria and Springs, have 100 per cent as subscribers. As our mission is scattered and we have to travel over such long distances between places, it is somewhat difficult today to visit the branches. Our trains are overcrowded
and of course we cannot use the car as we did formerly. We therefore have to contact many members by correspondence only. - Two of the charming dresses made from unbleached sacks by Relief Society women in the Southern States Mission. The dress at top has a pink yoke and pink embroidered flower. Scraps of bright printed material and appliqued strawberries add interest and beauty to the other dress. But we have been greatly blessed in that the members have learned to stand on their own feet more, and the majority have remained true and faithful."
Southern States Mission PFFIE MEEKS, president of Relief Societies in the Southern States Mission, is encouraging handwork and developing artistic skills
among the women of this mission. Working on the theory that something can be made out of nothing, she is fostering characteristic Latterday Saint thrift by utilizing materials at hand, including leftovers. The accompanying pictures illustrate a few of the lovely results. Sister  NOTES FROM THE FIELD Meeks writes as follows of the handicraft projects among the Relief Societies of this mission: "These children's dresses, made of flour and sugar bags, are beautiful in their simplicity. They afford an opportunity for children, in families of limited means, to have dresses which are pretty and at the same time practical. The sisters of the Relief Society are taught to properly combine colors, so that with these bags or scraps, which would otherwise be destroyed, and a little shadow embroidery or appliqued flowers, clothes for their children can be made which will put them in the better-dressed class. "It is our duty, as Latter-day Saints, to be thrifty. We should also try to bring out our creative abilities which sometimes are hidden, and this is an excellent way in which to do both. In addition to the many other things which make it a worthwhile project, it teaches children the appreciation of lovelier things and shows to the world that we can dress our children well and still be thrifty. "Another project of the mission Relief Societies which speaks of creative and artistic ability is that of shell craft. Out of seashells, which are very plentiful here in the South, beautiful costume jewelry and household articles, such as lamps and plaques, are being designed. This is indeed a fascinating work and it has proved to be a good hobby for convalescents. It teaches the ability to create with one's hands and also instills a desire for the finer things. It is being used successfully to create interest among the women when there is a tendency to grow tired of the same routine of making quilts and clothing. 589 "This shell craft possesses, in addition to its beauty, a commercial value. An easy market is found for it in the tourist trade which, in peace time, flocks to the Southland, and it can also be sold at Relief Society bazaars. It is something which the women of the South delight in making, for it is typical of the many things which can be made here in the South, if we but try to develop our resources. "Inasmuch as we have had our first conference in the Georgia District for lining up our fall work, I am enthused to the point that I should like to tell you about it. For our union meeting, I made assignments a few weeks ahead to the district president to have each one of the branches in the district give a demonstration of how this next winter's work was to be carried on. We had some very outstanding demonstrations from these little branches. The Atlanta Branch demonstrated how an ideal Relief Society should be conducted, the Columbus Branch presented the theology lesson, the song practice was conducted by the Augusta Branch, and the Macon Branch demonstrated the work day. I am sure each branch gained something from the others. "The Macon Branch gave such a good demonstration of the work day that I am sending you the samples they used. [See illustration.] They have a number of single girls and very young women belonging to the Relief Society, and they are teaching the very first steps in sewing. Some of these women are servicemen's wives. All of these samples were done by hand because not many of them have sewing machines. A few pages from the loose leaf set of sewing samples used in the work meeting demonstration by the Macon Branch Relief Society, Georgia District, Southern States Mission. Other samples show various basting and hand-sewing stitches, bias binding on both straight edges and corners, facings, plain and rolled hems, seam finishes, bound buttonholes, inset and patch pockets, plackets, bands with mitred corners, hemstitching,
and simple embroidery stitches. 590 Sister Florence Powell has spent much time in making up samples for the guidance and help of our women in learning to sew well, and she did not forget the economical side of conserving on thread in her training with hand stitches; for example, in the cross-stitched square, all thread is on top." British Mission ELDER HUGH B. BROWN, recently appointed president of the British Mission, wrote soon after his arrival in England of a mission-wide Relief Society convention held June 17 and 18, 1944, and of the bravery and devotion of these women who live in the war zone. His letter follows: RELIEF SOCIETY WOMEN IN THE WAR ZONE RELIEF Society sisters from all
parts of the British Mission assembled in a mission-wide convention at Birmingham, June 17 and 18. There were representatives present from all the districts and most of the branches, in spite of restrictions NOTES FROM THE FIELD on travel and the difficulties and inconveniences incidental thereto. "Sister Marie W. Anastasiou, president of the Relief Society of the mission, presided, and her counselors, Sister Nellie Poole and Sister Maud Hawkes, took charge of some of the meetings during the proceedings. "Upon walking into the banquet hall on Saturday evening, one felt at once to say, "This does not look like there is a war on!' for although Britain is rigidly rationed and although each family gets coupons for only sufficient for their actual needs, still these frugal sisters of the Relief Society had saved enough by a family rationing system within the national system to enable them to spread before the large numbers who were assembled a very palatable and refreshing meal and, in addition, to serve all the officers and teachers on the following day. "The theme of the conference was 'The Glory of God Is Intelligence,' and some very inspiring addresses were given followed by general discussion. "During the closing session Sister Anastasiou and her board were released with a hearty vote of thanks for their capable leadership during more than four years of strenuous activity.. "Sister Florence B. Dunn was sustained as president of the Relief Society of the British Mission, and she selected Sister Nellie Poole and Sister Maud Hawkes as her two counselors. Sister Dora Smith of the London office staff was sustained as secretary. Sister Dunn has moved to the mission office in London where her husband, Norman Dunn, is acting as mission secretary 591 and she will serve as mission mother as well as Relief Society president. "When one meets with and talks to these brave British mothers, he discovers the source of stamina, fortitude, and courage which has characterized the British people during the years of this searching test. "We read daily in the press and hear hourly on the radio of the deeds of valor of our brave men in the fighting forces. Many do not realize, however, that there are hundreds of Relief Society women in the war zone who have been exposed to dangers, trials and hardships, comparable to that which our men undergo in the battle field. These brave women have carried on in the face of almost insuperable difficulties. They form an army which gives an index to the character of the British people. A strange army it is, made up of grandmothers, mothers with children in their arms, spinsters, and little girls, not in uniform but in all the various colors and fashions worn by the members of various classes of society. Working in the home, in the garden, in the factories, in the Church, smiling through difficulties, seeking shelter when necessary, emerging when the 'all clear' sounds to take up their tasks where they left them, and always with a simple faith and trust in God which is the envy of many stout-hearted men, "To kneel in prayer with these women and to hear them thank God for their simple blessings, for the preservation of their lives and the lives of their loved ones, and for their scanty provisions and their windowless homes is at once an inspiration and a reproof to many of us whose material blessings far exceed any enjoyed here, but who frequently at being deprived of a few luxuries. "While the spirit which I saw in the Relief Society convention continues, democracy and the spirit of the gospel of Christ will live and flourish, and victory for the ideals for which the Church stands will never be in doubt.? WHERE BRAVE MEN KNEEL Eva Willes Wangsgaard There are no atheists where brave men kneel In foxholes or behind low dunes of sand; No anti-Christs, where lonely hunters steal Through fetid jungles, pointed knife in hand. When strong men find their lives are caught between 'Two enemies, the sea and men at war, They reach for greater strength on which to lean And feel a Presence never felt before. And they who cleave the dark on lifted wing, Whose homing hour can never be foreknown, Can hear a Voice above the thundering, And through their loneliness are not alone. So near are they to God, they surmount death, Aware of life, not limited by breath. Laundering Claire P. Dorius A survey of home laundry methods by the State of Washington says, "Tuesday is recommended for wash day since maximum production is attained on that day, and. Since laundering is recognized as a heavy household task." Some homemakers prefer to wash often by dividing the clothes logically?bath towels and bed clothes, one day; dish towels and table linen and clothing another; fussier things a day to themselves. Others prefer to wash all the clothes in one day. The amount of hot water available is a determining factor. Hard water presents a problem because of the sticky curd that forms and clings to the clothes. The degree of hardness in the water will determine the amount of softener to use. Trisodium phosphate is gaining in popularity, and is splendid: to use for cleaning purposes as well as laundering. Do not use too much. It can be purchased by the pound at almost any paint store. It is important that the softener be added and dissolved before soap or clothes are put in. Most washing machines hold from twelve to sixteen gallons of water. Experts tell us that a sufficient amount of soap will make a suds two to three inches deep on the top of the water. Do not overload the washer?six to eight pounds are considered a good average load. It is always safer to remove stubborn spots and stains before washing. Rips and tears are more quickly mended before going into the washer. Remember that "a stitch in time saves nine." Soaking in warm softened water, to which enough soap has been added to make a light suds, helps to remove stains and loosens the soil, saves time, and lessens wear. Do not soak colored clothes unless colors are known to be fast, and then not over twenty minutes. To Wash For white clothes use water so hot the hand cannot be held in it.. For colored clothes use water comfortably warm to the touch. Do not wash too long. Over washing may redistribute the dirt in the clothes and make them gray. Rinsing Rinse clothes thoroughly in plenty of clear, hot, soft water. Soft water in the rinse is more important than in the wash. Follow the hot rinse with a lukewarm rinse. The warm rinse may be followed by a cold rinse with or without bluing. Bluing clothes is optional. It makes white clothes which have become yellowed, whiter. Great care must be used in the use of bluing to prevent streaks. Line the clothes basket with oilcloth or a muslin cover. The ink from newspapers is apt to soil the clothes. Bleaches It has been found that bleaches play two important roles in laundering?they keep white cottons and linens from becoming dull and gray. And they remove many stains. Contrary to a general belief, they keep colored cottons and linens clear and bright, provided, of course, the colors Page 593 594 are resistant to soap and water. The improper use of bleach has lead to the belief that it "eats the clothes." Good Housekeeping Institute recommends that it be added to the washing suds rather than to the rinsing water, and measured accurately 1 tablespoon to each gallon of water. Rinse until all odor is removed. Another laboratory recommends that if clothes have already been grayed by the use of hard water and insufficient soap, they may be brought back to their original whiteness as follows: Add 3 cupfulls cheap white vinegar to a tubful of water. Soak the garments in this water until the soap curds have been completely softened. Washing Rayons When the tag says "washable," that means a "go-ahead" signal to wash the garment when it is soiled. It will not need much 'special pampering. Better results have been obtained when rayons have been washed in lukewarm water. Do not soak rayons before washing. When you wash your rayons by hand, make a rich suds and squeeze the dress in it until it is clean. Squeeze out as much water as possible, then roll the garment in a clean bath towel and press out the excess moisture. When rayons are washed in the machine, the washing time must be short, three to four minutes and two minutes to each rinse. Rayons should never be allowed to dry completely before ironing. Many rayons such as spun rayon, rayon sheers, and linen?like weaves and jerseys?iron best when they are almost dry. However. Dresses made entirely of acetate rayon need to be quite wet when ironed. Never use a hot iron. Rayon is not an elastic fiber. Hanging Clothes on the Line Hang clothes on the straight of the goods by their bands, if possible, on a clean line with clean pins. Stretch smooth and pin securely in three or four places. When dry, remove clothes from the line in a systematic way. Fold the straight pieces before placing in the basket to avoid wrinkles and to save time later. Avoid unnecessary bending when hanging clothes. Don't stoop every time you pick up a garment from a basket. Put your clothes basket on a bench or stool, or better yet, use a child's wagon which can be pulled to where you need it. If possible hang clothes outdoors?the white and light colored pieces in the sunlight, and the colored pieces in the shade.

CLOUD SHADOWS Thelma Ireland Giant shadows on the desert, Silhouettes in black and brown, Clouds that float upon the earth floor, Has the world turned upside down? UR DEPARIMENT Theology Church History Lesson 4?The Church of Jesus Christ Organized Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, January 2, 1945 Objective: To study the simple and direct way in which the Church organization was effected to keep alive the gospel truths. ?FOR where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" (Matt. 18:20). So spake the Christ to his disciples in the days of his ministry, and so in spirit began, and has continued, the organization of his Church in this day of the fullness of times. "Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail" (Doc. And Cov. 6:34). These were his words to the few. Servants he had singled out from the world in the years prior to the 6th of April, 1830, the date on which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized. But what of the rock against which earth and hell could not prevail? The answer to this question is to be found in the experiences that touched the hearts of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery; of Martin Hartis and David Whitmer; yes, and of the others who came to know the power of godliness in the beginning years of the "marvelous work." These men had witnessed heavenly manifestations of such a personal nature that, should any disbelief occur, those who remained firm, even to the last one, still could have an individual testimony of what had been seen and heard. God knew the strength of his Church must rest upon a personal knowledge of the truth within each soul who came to make up the company of members in his kingdom. With the return of the Priesthood of God to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery came the gift of the Holy Ghost to bear witness to the truth of this latter-day work. A witness which could be stronger even than that gained through the personal visitation of heavenly beings. Thus all men who sought God earnestly Page 595 596 could find again on earth the authority to bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost, a gift which could plant in every human heart a personal testimony that God lives and that his kingdom is again upon the earth. So from one, then two, then three, then six, then nine,' then a hundred, a thousand, two thousand, on and on would the Church membership increase with men and women who had come to know personally that inner light of the gospel. God would build his Church upon the rock of revelation, personal and prophetic. In the month of April and in the year of 1830, the following revelation came through Joseph the Prophet: The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April?Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this church; And to Oliver Cowdery, who was also called of God, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the second elder of this church, and ordained under his hand; And this according to the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory, both now and forever. Amen" (Doc. And Coy. 20:1-4). Here was the will of the Lord concerning the establishment of his Church which, ten years before on the spring morning in the grove, he had promised to the youth, Joseph Smith. Now, faithful to his word, the year, the month, even the day for its organization was given. On the sixth day of April in 1830, it being a Tuesday, there gathered those few souls who had believed the words of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and had by them been baptized for the remission of their sins. The place of their gathering was at the house of Peter Whitmer. Some distance back from the country road, planted among the rolling fields and sheltered by spreading trees, stood this typical upstate New York home. There the "little flock" assembled to shake hands, rejoice, and await the will of God which they knew would come through his first two elders. But more was in. Readiness for those who made up this first historic gathering than they knew. Joseph and Oliver, they were to discover, in turn would also wait. The Church was to be founded upon the law of common consent. This meant that the body of the Church membership was to have the right of sanctioning by vote the appointment of Joseph and Oliver in the office of presiding elders (Doc. And Cov., Sec. 26:2; 28:13). God had given man his free agency. Even authorized servants of his mind and will could be accepted or rejected by the membership of his Church. Obedience must come voluntarily. This helped to make more clear the reason why his Church was to be founded upon the rock of revelation. As long as a majority of his followers were living in tune with the promptings of the Holy Spirit they could know of the faith and integrity of those whom God had called to lead them. A willing and joyful acceptance 1/See Documentary History of the Church, Vol. I, pp. 76-77. LESSON DEPARTMENT of the proper names to be voted upon was therefore assured. What a happy state of government this, for both those who lead and those who follow! It inspires trust and confidence and frees the will of all, both high and low, to work in peace and harmony for the upbuilding of the kingdom.
In addition to having the leaders as well as the lay members of the Church in perfect accord, the Lord had specified that his organization should also be "agreeable to the laws of our country." Since the Church was to be organized in Fayette, Seneca County, of the State of New York, it would be necessary to effect the organization by having six members officially named and so recorded by law.
Today in the New York State of Zion the organized wards of the Church still must comply with this law in order to meet. Six duly elected members, therefore, of any ward must so present their names to the State as the minimum number to be considered an organized group. The tenure of office for any member so elected is three years. In order to have a continuing organization of six, the terms of office for any two members expire on different years. It becomes necessary, then, at each annual ward conference to re-elect to vote two members of the original six, or two entirely new members. Thus, according to the present practice, the names of the bishop, his two counselors, the ward clerk, and two other members of the ward the bishop nominates are officially elected by the ward, and their names recorded for the books of public record of the State of New York. This election, also, is as simple as that
the legal right of the ward to meet, always follows the familiar pattern so well understood in the Church today of sustaining, by a show of hands, the ward officers and teachers.
Since these experiences have become familiar to Latter-day Saints now residing in the Empire State, for them to read that the Church was organized with six members, adds a deeper significance to that Tuesday on the 6th day of April, 1830. And so should one consult the books of public record long since filed away in the archives of New York State for that day, one would find the following names: Joseph Smith, Jun., Oliver Cowdery, Hyrum Smith, Peter Whitmer, Jun., Samuel H. Smith, and David Whitmer. We will leave it to the reader to decide why these names, with the exception of the first two elders, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery?whom God had set at the head?should have been selected from among the baptized members there assembled to comply with the command of God that his Church should be organized. Whatever answers are given to this question are of no great moment other than that of personal longing to know exactly what were the happy details that went to make up this historic day. Perhaps the esteem and love of this group for the young men of the Smith family, plus the hospitality of the Whitmers, had something to do with it. When all was in readiness, Joseph Smith opened the meeting with prayer and then in direct and simple speech asked all of those present if they were willing to accept him and Oliver as the leaders and teachers in 598 the kingdom of God; further, were those present willing to become organized as a church? As with one response all agreed, whereupon Joseph laid his hands on Oliver and ordained him an elder in the Church of Christ, after which Joseph received the same ordination and office under the hands of Oliver. The sacrament of the Lord's supper was administered, and then followed the confirmation of the baptized members of the Church who also were made recipients of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, Joseph and Oliver officiating. The Spirit was richly abundant, all rejoiced and praised God, many prophesied. Thus in simplicity and by the law of common consent was founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Thus arose, as a system, what the world terms Mormonism,?universally regarded as the most remarkable religious movement of modern times; detested and denounced through Christendom as a dangerous and soul-destroying imposture, but revered and defended by its disciples as the wonderful work of the Almighty, the veritable "marvelous work and wonder" foretold by Isaiah and other ancient seers, which was to prepare the world, by the preaching of a restored gospel and the founding of a latterday Zion for Messiah's second coming and the advent of the Millennium (Whitney, History of Utah, Vol. 1, P- 59). "By their fruits ye shall know them," said the Savior. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class catty on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doc. Trine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for our life in this day. 1. For what do you remember each of the six original members of the Church? (The teacher could list the six names on the board to help start the discussion, Follow whatever comes from this activity and response with the suggested readings presently given.) Hyrum Smith, Peter Whitmer, Junior, Samuel H. Smith and David Whitmer, four of the original six first members of the Church, early sought the will of the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph, concerning his wishes toward them. The Lord said to Peter Whitmer, "Behold, blessed are you for this thing" (Doc. And Cov., Sec. 16:5). Among other reasons which may come to mind as to why these men were chosen to become the four of the first six members, certainly, should be listed their humility and desire to know the will of the Lord. For a closer picture of these men have the following Sections in the Doc. And Cov. Read: 11; 14; 16; 23; 24. What personal words of comfort and warming do you find in these Sections which bear specifically on the life of each man? The Doctrine and Covenants Commentary has rich historical notes for these Sections. 2. Several revelations of the Prophet Joseph were received in the presence of his brethren. How do you think they knew when he spoke in the name of the Lord? The 21st Section of the Doctrine and Covenants was given during the meeting called for the organization of the Church. Have this read. What lessons today could the saints take from this revelation? The next question may be used if needed for further class activity or it may be assigned for home study. Section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants, a revelation on Church government given in April 1830, can be most enlightening to one wishing to read, in direct form, the operation of Church government set up to administer the gospel plan. Think as you read it of your experiences of worship as a member of the Church, LESSON DEPARTMENT 599 Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes Lesson 4?Blessed Are They Which Do Hunger and Thirst After Righteousness Elder Bryant S. Hinckley For Tuesday, January 2, 1945 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled (Matt. 5:9). Objective: intellectual and spiritual growth. S6MAAN shall not live by bread alone," is the divine mandate. But man must have bread; he cannot live without it. The man who has lost all appetite for his daily bread is to be pitied. But how infinitely greater is the tragedy when all desire for the bread of life is lost. This higher hunger, the hunger for righteousness, is the mark of man's superiority; the secret of his progress; the source of his growth intellectually and spiritually. Those who hunger for knowledge and thirst for the truth have been the great teachers and leaders of the 'race. The Savior in speaking to the Nephites gave this Beatitude a definite meaning. Third Nephi 12:6 states: "And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost." This is a clear and definite promise. What does it mean to be To show that the hunger and thirst for righteousness is the source of filled with the Holy Ghost? The scriptures make clear the mission of the Holy Ghost: It is to guide you into all truth; to bring to your remembrance things of the past and to make known to you things to come. Speaking of the Holy Ghost which is promised to those who "hunger and thirst after righteousness," the Savior said: "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.... But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (John 14:16-17, 26). 600 "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:" (John 15:26) The power of the Holy Ghost makes men greater, increases their wisdom, enlightens their minds, gives them faith, hope, charity and the impelling power of a strong conviction. This is the peculiar and precious gift which the gospel offers to all who will obey its precepts and conform to its teachings, to all "who hunger and thirst after righteousness." ??? Literature New Testament Lesson 4?Wisdom Literature of the New Testament Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, January 16, 1945 SAYINGS of our Savior are gems of radiant truth. For simplicity, clarity, and strength, for depth of wisdom, they are unsurpassed in all literature. Added to this, many of these sayings, by their natural music and imagery, rise to the rarest in poetic expression.. Where, for example, outside of the New Testament, can one find truth expressed more effectively, more artistically than in these typical sayings of the Master? Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest (Matt. 11:28), Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these (Matt. 6:28-29). Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God (Mark 10:14). Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole (Mark 10:52). Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head (Luke 9:58). Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do (Luke 23:34). For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16). Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more (John 8:11). I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (John 8:12). It is small wonder that with inspired words such as these coming from Jesus, listeners should say, "Never man spake like this man" (John 7:46); or that learned critics of his day should question, "How LESSON DEPARTMENT knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" (John 7:15). Nor should we marvel that, with deference to the Father who had sent him as "a light to the world," the Savior would say with divine assurance, "my words shall not pass away" (Mark 13:31). Truly, no words have been more remembered and treasured. Nor have the sayings of any other man been a more lasting influence for good. These precious sayings, carried in the hearts of those who heard them, recorded by the apostles Matthew and John, and later by Mark and Luke, are an unsurpassed heritage of spiritual literature. In his appraisal of the Master, Dr. Dinsmore says: We think of Jesus as teacher, example, redeemer, but we are not accustomed to consider his marvelous power of literary expression.... In him all fullness dwelt? fullness of the prophetic spirit, fullness of wisdom, fullness of poetic utterance.... Socrates in his last hours reasoned about immortality; Jesus pursued no argument; he simply said, "In my Father's house are many mansions... I go to prepare a place for you." His sentences inevitably fall into the natural cadence of deep emotion. He spoke in metaphors and reasoned in parables. Beyond all this, as every true believer in Christ has felt, there is the touch of divinity in his words that illuminates the mind and quickens the soul. They inspire one to deeds of righteousness. The Savior knew and constantly acknowledged the source of the power that enabled him "to speak with authority and not as the scribes." He could say humbly, yet with certainty, "The words that I speak unto you, they 601 are spirit, and they are life" (John 6:63). No pretense to oratory can be discerned in the messages of the Master. They fell from his lips naturally; yet how directly they went to the mark. Nor did Jesus ever pose as a preacher. Rather he was a great teacher, living the truth he portrayed with words of clarity and power. He taught individuals rather than classes or congregations. True, folk flocked about him, sometimes in multitudes; yet even in the midst of the throng, he was dealing with individual needs. A blind man is restored to sight; a child is lifted up and blessed; a woman touches the hem of his garment and he turns to say, "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole" (Mark 5:34). It was ever a specific message that he gave. Its application was concrete and definite; yet it went to the hearts of all. These vital lessons of life sprang naturally out of human. Situations and human needs. His illustrations, likewise, were drawn from everyday experiences. When Simon Peter and Andrew, fishermen of Galilee, were called, it was, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers. Of men" (Matt. 4:19). When he would impress the vital work of saving those that had gone astray, he spoke of seeking a "lost sheep." When he had asked for a drink from the woman at the well, he impressed a divine lesson with these words, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst" (John 4:14). It is from precious sayings, such as these, taken with their life settings, that the living gospel is portrayed. 602 74 In his "Sermon on the Mount, this message is presented somewhat more fully. Yet this masterful presentation of some of the fundamentals of the gospel was hardly a sermon in the ordinary sense of this term. It does not follow the text and comment construction commonly used by preachers. Rather it is an array of gems of wisdom, filled with divine inspiration, pointing the way of righteousness and encouraging men to follow the path leading to eternal life. In style the "Sermon on the Mount" is somewhat like the Proverbs. Yet it rises to greater brilliance. The Sermon presents a newer, more deeply spiritual message. Something of ringing challenge for our better selves is in such lines as "Ye are the light of the world.... Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven.... Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth... But lay up for yourself treasures in heaven... No man can serve two masters... Ye cannot serve God and Mam-?? Mon The Beatitudes, with which the Sermon is opened, are full of solace, are radiant in their gospel light. What words, for example, carry a more healing touch than these: "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted"? What have more uplift than these: "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God"; "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God"? What words point the way more plainly towards growth in the gospel than these: "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled'? (See III Nephi 12:6). Often the sayings of Jesus become poetic in their cadence and _ their vivid imagery. Their structure is at times like Hebraic parallel verse; for example: Behold the fowls of the air: For they sow not, Neither do they reap, Nor gathereth into barns; Yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Ze & Not every one that saith, "Lord, Lord," Shall enter the kingdom of Heaven: But he that doeth the will of my Father, Which is in heaven. * * * And the rain descended And the floods came, And the winds blew and beat upon that house; And it fell not: For it was founded upon a rock. Another excellent example of thythmically beautiful expression is "The Lord's Prayer." It is this music and beauty of expression, as well as the profound wisdom they carry, that make the sayings of Jesus easy to learn by heart. And this explains, in part, why they have been remembered and treasured through the years. Discussion and Activities 1.
