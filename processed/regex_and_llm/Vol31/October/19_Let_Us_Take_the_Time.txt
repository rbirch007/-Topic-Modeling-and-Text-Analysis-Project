Let Us Take The Time Margaret E. Maslin ONE morning, a friend whom I seldom see, due to our heavy family cares and the distance between our homes, walked in my door with her two youngest children. What a pleasure it was to see her, yet I couldn't repress a sigh of weariness, thinking of the day's work piled up, 4 child just over the measles, and another fretful with Much as 1 would enjoy 4 whole day's visit, the shirked work would be almost more than I could manage before suppertime, weakened as I was from a month's illness and from nursing My sick husband and four children, with the worthy and prospective tasks incident to nursing another very sick baby. But my friend soon cheered me as I strove to make her comfortable. "I haven't come to sit and talk, but to work," she exclaimed vigorously, as she took out an apron from her bag and tied it on. So, while I cared for my sick baby, with the other children playing happily in the kitchen, this good friend eased my load, ironing, sewing, and doing dishes, while we snatched all-too brief moments to talk.

Time won't wait for us and we may, in the end, find regrets that will take more toll of our time and strength than the little things we could have up and done. A woman I know in good health widowed, whose children are grown up and gone, goes from house to house bemoaning her lonely existence: "No one need could help someone and be wanted." She sees mothers overburdened by illness and cares while she sits and talks and talks and talks. Criticizing their methods, "Now, when I was nursing etc." the present In which she plays no part, except for speaking of her lack of friends, of not being wanted, nor needed. Never does she lift a finger to prove her reiterated desire to help. If she is pinned down to proving her sincerity, she has an errand suddenly remembered, or the mending "isn?t worth doing, throw it away."
