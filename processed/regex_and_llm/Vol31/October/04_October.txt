OCTOBER 1944: 66 AND as Jesus Passed by, 547 AND as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was bhnd from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born bhnd?" (John 9:1-2) The very question seems to de-clare a prevailing notion that infirm-ity or affliction necessitates the con-clusion that it is the result of sin. Jesus with finality exploded that notion for he answered: ''Neither hath this man sinned, nor his par-ents: but that the works of God should be made, manifest in him.*' He proceeded to give point to his emphatic declaration by seizing the occasion both to manifest the works of God and to absolve the afflicted man of the imputation lurking in the question, for he anointed the man's eyes with clay moistened with spittle and bade him wash in the pool of Siloam, whence he came away seeing. This is not to say that physical and mental affliction may not result from sin. It is well known that they do, which perhaps may account for the persistence of the notion implicit in the question of the disciples. The point is that such misfortune is not, standing alone, proof of wrongdoing. This should bring comfort to inno-cent safferers and at the same time admonish observers of infirmity to sentiments of charity. Closely akin to the idea nourished by the disciples, and of particular consequence under existing circumstances, ist he disturbing question whether men who die in batfle have by misdeeds forfeited the protection of providential care. It haunts the minds of conscientious. God-fearing mothers, wives, sweethearts. They wonder why, their loved ones being good, and engaged, as they believe, in a righteous cause, God did not protect them, or, since these have died, are they guilty of offense. Such dread questions can arise only from failure of right understanding. If God forthwith smote down the evildoer, there would be no wicked left; if he preserved always the good, the righteous would never die. There would be little room left for the uncoerced play o f freedom of choice if goodness were immediately and directly rewarded by immunity from trial and sorrow, and wrongdoing were discouraged by summary and condign punishment to the offender. That would present a condition but little removed from compulsion. That is not the process by which men develop their latent powers and grow in the strength of love of right. If every act were done under the immediate constraint of fear of direct consequences or certainty of escape from suffering, as the case might be, there would be no room for the exercise of f aith or for trust in the ultimate triumph of good over evil in the hearts of men. The doer of good would be little removed from the 548 plane of the bribetaker, and refraining from evil would be on the level of cowering fear. There has never been any promise to the righteous of immunity from privation, suffering, hardship, sorrow and death. All these things the Redeemer himself suffered, and the record tells us that he learned obedience through the things he suffered. In his lofty admonition issued from the Mount, Jesus said, "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you." And _ all this they should do that they might "be the children of your Father which is in heaven." 'That was the Father's course as Jesus reminded them "for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." Thus the divine power rises high above the mean pettiness of capricious tyranny in its exercise. Every one recognizes its superiority. "For," said he, "if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same? "And if ye salute your brethren only, what-do ye more than others? Do not even the publicans so? "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." attain this status men must face evil and overcome it with good. They must rise to a higher plane than returning hate for hate and seeking reprisal against offenders. Reprisal invites retaliation which, in turn, induces payment again in kind, and so the evil spirals and weaves about those who indulge it an entangling web from which there is no escape save through rewarding evil with good. Besides, the passageway from mortality into immortality is through death. All men must pass through it, even the faithful who are alive at the Lord's coming. "And he that liveth when the Lord shall come, and hath kept the faith, blessed is he; nevertheless, it is appointed to him to die at the age of man" (Doc. And Cov. 63:50). In like ae Alma records: "but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end" - (Alma 12:27). And Nephi writes: "For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfill the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall;... "Wherefore it must needs be an infinite atonement?save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption"...(2 Nephi 9:6-7). Paul instructed the Corinthians: "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality" (I Cor. 15:53). That all must die we know from the unbroken experience of the race. What we do not know is the time and circumstances of its coming. From the scripture we learn that it is not an unmixed evil, but marks a stage in the course of life, perchance opening the way to a richer, fuller living than could be known in mortality.
