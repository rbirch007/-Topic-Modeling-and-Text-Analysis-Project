The New Turkey Dr. Leland Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah [This is the fifth in a series of articles by Dr. Creer on the historical backgrounds of some of the countries involved in the present war.?Ed.] AT the beginning of the twentieth century, the Ottoman still blocked the eastern end of the Mediterranean, enveloping it wholly from the Black Sea and the Dardanelles to the Red Sea and the Nile Delta?a great sprawling colossus sometimes derisively referred to as the "Sick Man of Europe." And indeed a very sick man he was, and yet, within a de cade after the close of World Wat J, when through the Treaty of Sevres the victorious Allies had planned to this once grandiose 'Sick Man" revived and, under the leadership of one Mustapha Kemal Pasha, reasserted himself through one of the most remarkable nationalistic revolutions of all time. As a result, the new postwar Turkey has become a nation as vigorous and progressive as its parent was feeble and reactionary, country as compact and homogeneous as its progenitor was unwieldy and composite. The original Ottoman Turks were one of the Central Asian hordes. Eventually anchored themselves in Anatolia at the close of the thirteenth century. The tribe took its name from one, Orthman, who succeeded Ertogrul in 1288. The latter had founded the nucleus of the kingdom in the plain stretching between Brusa and Nicaea in the ' northwestern cornet of Asia Minor. The first capital was Yemshebr. For more than two centuries thereafter, the successors of Ertogrul and Orthman process the Arab lands of Syria, Egypt, Iraq, and 1306, the conquest. Of the Balkan Peninsula was begun. Eastern Macedonia was conquered in 137 Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, was taken in 1385. On June 15, 1389, one of the most fateful battles in the history of the Near East was fought on the historic plain of Kossovo in modern Yugoslavia. Here the Turks overwhelmed the armies of the Slavic Confederacy and Serbia, as an independent state, was blotted out. For five hundred years never rallied. Many of them took refuge in the mountains of Monte: negro and there, throughout this benighted period, maintained 4 brave but hopeless fight for freedom. Others migrated to Bosnia and Hungary. Beginning in 1397) the Ottomans turned their attention to Greece. Thessaly, Phocis, Locris, part of Epirus and southern Albania were quickly conquered. Athens and Salonica alone of the important Greek cities remained for a few decades longer in Christian hands. In 1440, at the battle of Varna and later in 1448, at the second battle of Kossovo, the Turks drove the Hungarians out of the Balkans and, on May 29, 1453, carried by assault the great city of Constantinople. This latter event ended the existence of the last surviving remnant of the once glorious Roman Empire.

In 1471, the last Seljukian principality, Karamania, was added. In 1475, the Turks, by conquering Azov and the Crimea, acquired complete control of both shores of the Black Sea. In 1512, a three years' war with the Shah Ismail of Persia resulted in the acquisition of Mesopotamia. Egypt, Syria, and Arabia were successively conquered during the first two decades of the sixteenth century. These conquests led to the transferal of the caliphate to the sultan, who henceforth became the protector of the holy places of Islam and Christendom, and the spiritual head of Mohammedanism throughout the world. In 1522, the important island of Rhodes in the Dodecanese fell, and the Knights Hospitalers were forced to flee to Crete, later, in 1530, to THE NEW TURKEY found a permanent home on the island of Malta. Hungary and Transylvania were conquered in 1541. In 1529, Suleiman the Magnificent, greatest of Turkish sultans, with 250,000 men and 300 guns attempted to besiege Vienna. In view of the menace to Christendom, Protestants and Catholics alike prepared to defend the Austrian capital. After a siege of twenty-four days, Suleiman was forced to withdraw. Unsuccessful attempts to capture the city were made again in 1532, 1541, and 1566. The year 1529 was a crucial one for the Moslems, for it witnessed the termination of their victorious advance in Europe. Of similar importance was the great naval battle of Lepanto, off the western coast of Greece, in 1571. In this engagement the Turks were defeated by a combination of Christian states which included Spain, Tuscany, Parma, Lucca, Venice, Genoa, and the Papacy. This crucial victory proved that the Turks were no longer invincible. Henceforth their political power and prestige rapidly declined. Many factors had contributed to the phenomenal rise of the Ottomans and the rapid extension of their empire. Among these may be mentioned: (1) the hopeless decrepitude of the Byzantine Empire; (2). The customary lack of cohesion among the Slavic peoples; (3) the jealousies and antagonisms of the Western Powers, particularly during the sixteenth century; (4) the Babylonian captivity at Avignon and the subsequent schism of the Papacy; (5) the military prowess and shrewd statesmanship of Suleiman the Magnificent; and (6) the splendid organization and discipline of the Turkish Army during the fifteenth, sixteenth, and part of the seventeenth centuries. 559 N 1699, through the Treaty of Carlowitz, the 'Turks suffered their first major territorial loss when they were forced to cede to the Hapsburg emperor the rich province of Transylvania and the whole of Hungary, except the Banat of Temesvar. About the same time (1696), Peter the Great invaded the Crimea and captured the fortress of Azov. This was the first appearance of Russia in the Black Sea reg. Ion. It was just the beginning, however, of a series of intrigues which were to make Russia the most deadly enemy of the Turks. Russia's advance toward the Black Sea was assiduously fostered by Catherine the Great. By the Treaties of Kutschukkainardji (1774) and Jassy (1792), the Porte was forced to acknowledge the cession of the entire Crimea to Russia, and to accept the role of Russia as special protector of Christian subjects residing within the Turkish Empire. During the nineteenth century, the rapid disintegration of the polyglot Turkish Empire was the direct result of the resurgence of nationalism which, in turn, had found its origin in French Revolutionary influences and in the vigorous opposition everywhere expressed toward the reactionary Metternich regime. Thus, in 1831, Greece won its independence and the Serbs acquired political autonomy. By the Treaty of Berlin (1878) the independence of Serbia, Rumania, and Montenegro was confirmed, and autonomy granted to the provinces of Bosnia. Herzegovina, Eastern Roumelia and Bulgaria, the latter under Russian protection. The Turks ? lost Algeria (1847), Tunis (1881), and 560 Morocco (1912) to France; Tripoli (1911) to Italy; and Egypt (1881) to England. In 1908, Bulgaria became independent, while Bosnia and Herzegovina were ceded to Austria. As a result of the Balkan Wars (1912-1913), the Turks gave Crete to Greece, acknowledged the newly created state of Albania, and surrendered Macedonia, her only remaining Balkan territory, to Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria. As a result of these losses, the European possessions of Turkey had been reduced to a small strip of territory drawn within a boundary extending from Media on the Black Sea to Enos at the mouth of the Maritza on the Aegean, and including only 10,882 square miles, an area equivalent in size to that of the State of Maryland. Then came World War I (1914- 1918). Making common cause with Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria, against England, France, and Russia, largely because of fear of the pincer implications of an Anglo-Russian alliance, the Turks abolished the hated foreign-imposed rights of extra-territoriality with a sweeping gesture of defiance, and proclaimed a holy war against the enemies of Germany. But the Turkish armies were defeated, a humiliating armistice was signed at Mudros, and the discredited Young Turk leaders fled the country. An analysis of the factors contributing to the disruption of the Turkish Empire reveal the following as among the most important: (1) the lack of any constructive program of economic and social welfare, hence the masses of the peasantry remained apathetic and passively discontented; (2) the decadence in efficiency and prestige of the Janissaries, corps d'elite of the Turkish army; (3) deterioration of the personnel of the sultanate (for example, there were twelve successions to the throne in the seventeenth century as compared with six in the sixteenth, and of the former, three were dethroned and one murdured?"Until the accession of the Keuprilis in 1653, the internal history of the empire is one monotonous vista of anarchy and decay."); (4) lack of education; (5) inability of the administration to assimilate the various non-national minorities; (6) the absence of democratic institutions; (7) the vigorous reaction of the non-Turkish minorities toward the Young Turks' policy of Ottomanization, or racial absorption; (8) the application of a militant form of nationalism in Europe during the nineteenth century which, among other things, accelerated the disruption of non-national empires; and (g) the diplomatic equipoise among the Great Powers which kept alive Turkey, even as the "Sick Man of Europe." Had the Turkish Parliament ratified the Treaty of Sevres, as the latter was drawn up by the Allies and signed on August 10, 1920 by representatives of the discredited Sultan Mohammed VI, the once resplendent Ottoman Empire would have been reduced to an insignificant region of desert and mountains tucked away in Asia Minor. However, despite the fact that Sultan Mohammed VI, overawed by the Allied ships and forces at Constantinople, had agreed to ratify the document, an energetic group of Nationalists, led by Mustapha Kemal Pasha, thought otherwise and determined to prevent ratification. 'Thus was begun the second great renaissance in modern Turkey, a revolution which was destined to transform that decadent state into one of the most progressive and forward looking. Countries in all Europe. THE NEW TURKEY MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA had proved himself to be one of Turkey's best generals in the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. During World War I, he played a conspicuous part in the defeat of the Allies at Gallipoli in 1915. Under the circumstances, it is not surprising to learn that Kemal was deeply chagrined when the Allies successfully imposed on Turkey the Armistice of Mudros (October 1918), and that, in retaliation, he gathered about him in central Anatolia the nucleus of a new party, the Turkish Nationalists, who planned at once the resuscitation of their national homeland. In July 1919, accordingly, a Nationalist Congress was called at Erzerum to consider party policy. Later, on January 28, 1920, a second Congress was called at Constantinople. This body adopted a statement of principles since known as the Turkish National Pact. However, the Allies had no intention of permitting the Nationalists to proceed with their plans. Accordingly, on March 15, 1920, an Allied army commanded by the British General Milne marched into Constantinople, proclaimed martial law, arrested as many Nationalist representatives as could be found and shipped some forty of them to Malta. Most of the Nationalists who had escaped arrest, including Kemal, repaired to the city of Ankara, there to set up a rump parliament under the name of the Grand National Assembly. When the sultan now convened another parliament at Constantinople, the country had two governing bodies: one subordinate to the sultan and maintained by Allied troops; the other supported by the National sentiment 561 of the Turkish people and protected by the desert and mountains separating Ankara from Constantinople and the Allied forces. The defiant Ankaran Assembly, on April 23, 1920, elected Mustapha Kemal Pasha as its president as well as commander in chief of the Nationalist Army. Not quite a year later, on January 21, 1921, this same body proclaimed Turkey a republic, and adopted a constitution which provided for responsible government. Meanwhile three Greek armies, with some British naval support, had driven the Nationalists out of. Thrace and pushed eastward into Anatolia as far as Ushaq. British support was soon withdrawn, however, when it was learned that the French and the Italians had no intention of enforcing by arms the unpopular Treaty of Sevres which had allotted Smyrna and the Ionian hinterland to the Greeks. Despite this setback, the Greeks opened up a new offensive which enabled them to reach the Sakharia River, only fifty miles from - Ankara, before the end of August 1921. Then the drive was spent and the Greeks were unable to make any further advance. From August 24 until September 16, the ill-equipped but inspired Turks, under the brilliant leadership of Mustapha Kemal, won the battle of Sakharia, and then began a counteroffensive which not only cleared the Greeks from the Ionian coastland, but threatened the reconquest of eastern Thrace and much of the former Turkish territory in the Balkan Peninsula. This change of fortune led to the armistice urged by the British and signed at Mudania 562 and later to the Treaty of Lausanne (July 24, 1923). Under the terms of this treaty, 'Turkey recovered all eastern Thrace as far west as the Maritza River, including the city of Adrianople (now Edirne). In addition, she was permitted to recover the bridgehead and railroad center on the west bank of the Maritza at Karagach. Constantinople was _restored as an integral part of the Turkish state, but the Zone of the Straits was demilitarized and opened to the ships of all nations, no matter what their cargo, in times of peace and when Turkey was neutral in times of war. In the event of 'Turkey's belligerency, enemy vessels might be kept out of the Straits, but not those of neutral countries. In the Aegean Sea, Turkey retained Imbros, Tenedos, and the Rabbit Islands, while Dodecanesia and Rhodes were ceded to Italy. Most of the remaining Aegean Islands went to Greece. 'Turkey gave up all claims to Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and the Arabian kingdoms, and recognized the British annexation of Cyprus. The unpopular rights of extra-territoriality were abolished, foreign control of customs was lifted, and no restrictions were placed on Turkey's military, naval, and air forces. A -supplementary Graeco-Turkish Convention provided for the compulsory exchange of Turkish subjects in Greece for Greek subjects in Turkey; and another stipulated the demilitarization of the Graeco-Bulgarian Turkish frontier in eastern Thrace. As a result of her successful war with the Greeks, the Turks were able to force the Allies to abrogate the hated and unpopular Treaty of Sevres and to accede to their claims as drawn in the popular Treaty of Lausanne. Turkey was left with an area of about 295,000 square miles, the size of Texas and South Carolina combined, and with a population (1923) of about 13,000,000. URSUANT to the terms of the Lausanne Treaty, the Turkish Nationalists began at once their program of expatriation. This involved the exchange of some 1,000,000 Greeks living in Ionia for some 400,000 Turks living in Greece. The actual process of this exchange involved untold suffering. It frequently was difficult to decide whether a family should be considered Turkish or Greek, particularly when the original migrations had taken place a century or more ago. Fraud and corruption were common, and official carelessness often resulted in the transplanting of mountaineers onto plains or the transference of plainsmen and farmers to the mountains. Under the brilliant leadership of President Mustapha Kemal Pasha (1923-1938), the following marked social and religious innovations of far-reaching significance were introduced: (1) the abolition of the sultanate; (2) the abolition of the Turkish caliphate (spiritual leadership of the Mohammedan world); (3) the abolition of Mohammedanism as the state religion of Turkey; (4) recognition of freedom of religion; (5) modification along Occidental lines of the Mohammedan ritual; (6) the enactment of a series of laws relating to the position of women, such as the abolition of polygamy, recognition of divorce, required civil marriages, abolition of the Oriental custom of wearing the veil, and the political emancipation of women; (7) 563 the abolition of capitulations or the rights 563 of extraterritoriality; (8) the adoption of civil, penal, and commercial law codes based on those of Switzerland, Italy, and Germany respectively; (9) compulsory school attendance for those between the ages of seven and sixteen with the result
that illiteracy has declined from eighty-five per cent to forty-two per cent; (11) the adoption of the Latin alphabet ? newspapers were ordered to abandon the old Arabic type and the publication of books printed in Arabic characters was strictly forbidden; (12) required teaching of the Turkish language in the new Latin script for all Turks under the age of forty ? certifications of literacy were demanded from all those who aspired to citizenship; (13) the  publication of an official dictionary containing 24,000 words, strictly Turkish in origin; (14) prohibition of the teaching of religion in public or private elementary schools; (15) the equipment of local community centers, called Halkevis, as centers of cultural propaganda;
(16) the adoption of the metric system; (17) the compulsory adoption of surnames (thus in 1934 Mustapha Kemal Pasha became Ataturk by vote of the Grand National Assembly ? a name meaning "Father of the Turks" and Ataturk in turn hose the surname of Inonu for Ismet
Pasha, to commemorate his victories in the Turkish War of Independence); and finally, (18) as a definite "symbol of intellectual liberation," the abolition of the wearing the fez or turban, the distinguishing mark of pious Moslems. Before the advent of the Nationalist revolution, relatively few Turks concerned themselves with trade, commerce, and industry. The masses generally preferred to labor in the fields. Hence business affairs became a monopoly of the other racial groups within the empire, particularly the Greeks, Jews, and Armenians.
But the Turkish Nationalists are determined to limit capital, labor, production, and ownership as
far as possible to native Turks. As a result, through government aid and encouragement, a commercial middle class has arisen, the nucleus of which is a group of Turkish refugees from Greece. Commercial treaties have been signed with Russia,
Great Britain, Italy, and the United States. In 1929, the National Assembly voted a huge appropriation for a twelve-year consolidated public-works program, including railway, port, irrigation, reclamation, and highway construction projects. Infant industries have been stimulated through a protective tariff system. These include textile factories, cotton gins, sugar refineries, and sawmills. Within three years after the inauguration of this program, the
value of Turkish manufactures increased from $20,000,000 to $50,000,000. Leading Turkish exports include tobacco, fruits, cereals and cotton, with increasing amounts of mineral products, including chrome ore, zinc, coal, copper, antimony 
and petroleum. There has been a tendency in Turkey, in the interests of efficiency, to establish state control over a number of industries. Thus the government today owns most of the railways and a large portion of the merchant marine. It also has monopolized the production of tobacco, gunpowder, salt, and alcoholic beverages. But the rural peasant classes have not been neglected. The government has subsidized agriculture by the free grant of cattle, plows, and even houses to deserving families. Agricultural production has been encouraged
further by material reduction of taxes and by a marked reduction of the term of military service required of the peasant class. The keynote of Turkey's foreign
policy is peace. Recently at the world's fair in New York, Western sightseers were impressed by the modern Turkish Pavilion that was dominated by the statue of a man who symbolized the New Turkey. The man stood with one foot on the shore of Turkey-in-Europe, the other on that of Turkey-in-Asia. Underneath were the words: "Turkey unites Europe and Asia, in Peace." To date (1944) this claim has been made good. Turkey remains today one of the few important
neutrals in Europe and Asia, although on August 2 of this year (1944), the Turkish Grand National Assembly, upon the recommendation of Premier Sukru Saracoglu, broke all diplomatic and economic relations with Germany, an action which quite likely will result in war. This much is certain, if the New Turkey of the future is to function as a first-rate power in Europe and Asia, the government must play a shrewd and cautious diplomatic game. It will be necessary, especially, to establish friendly relations with Russia, England, and Germany, for each of these countries will continue to have designs on the Straits ?bridgehead of Europe and Asia-Russia in order to obtain egress to the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas; England because of her strategic interests in Egypt, Suez, India, and Afghanistan; and Germany, in order to revive her Drang nach Osten policy toward Mesopotamia. A strong, vigorous, dignified foreign
and domestic policy will be needed. Turkey can no longer afford to survive 564 merely as the "Sick Man of Europe." In 1934, Turkey with Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Greece joined the so-called Balkan Pact, which guarantee Security of respective frontiers. In 1937, Turkey adhered to the Middle-Eastern Pact
with similar guarantees with her eastern neighbors Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. Thus Turkey has become the link between two interlocking alliances, the Balkan and the Middle-Eastern Ententes. In 1925, the Turkish government concluded a treaty of neutrality and non-aggression with Soviet Russia. This was renewed in 1930, and again in 1933. Similar treaties were concluded with Italy, Turkey, and the United States. In 1929 and 1931 this developed into most-favored nation treaties between these two countries. Turkey has been active in promoting the movement for Balkan Confederation. As a result of the recent Balkan Conferences,
which Turkish delegates have always attended, two positive results have
been achieved: (1) the establishment of an Inter-Balkan (Turkey, Greece, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia) Chamber of Commerce; and (2) an Inter-Balkan Tobacco Bureau. The changes wrought by the Turkish Nationalists in the development of their country have been truly astounding, but their task is far from ended. "We must work much more," said Premier Ismet Pasha, in 1931. ?We Must work a thousand years.?
