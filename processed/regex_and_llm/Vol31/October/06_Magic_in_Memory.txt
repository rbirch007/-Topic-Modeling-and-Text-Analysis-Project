MAGIC IN MEMORY Courtney E. Cottam
There is magic in memory, glorious, precious; Wind in the eaves when dark clouds hang low; A song clearly heard on a cold, crystal evening? The snap of a twig, overburdened with snow.
There is magic in memory, comforting, deathless, Bringing you back to my hungering heart; Knowing my loved one will live on forever, And though we are parted, we are not apart.
