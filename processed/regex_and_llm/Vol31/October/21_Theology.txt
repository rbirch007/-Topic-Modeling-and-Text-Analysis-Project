theology lesson, the song practice was conducted by the Augusta Branch, and the Macon Branch demonstrated the work day. I am sure each branch gained something from the others. "The Macon Branch gave such a good demonstration of the work day that I am sending you the samples they used. [See illustration.] They have a number of single girls and very young women belonging to the Relief Society, and they are teaching the very first steps in sewing. Some of these women are servicemen's wives. All of these samples were done by hand because not many of them have sewing machines. A few pages from the loose leaf set of sewing samples used in the work meeting demonstration by the Macon Branch Relief Society, Georgia District, Southern States Mission. Other samples show various basting and hand-sewing stitches, bias binding on both straight edges and corners, facings, plain and rolled hems, seam finishes, bound buttonholes, inset and patch pockets, plackets, bands with mitred corners, hemstitching,
and simple embroidery stitches. 590 Sister Florence Powell has spent much time in making up samples for the guidance and help of our women in learning to sew well, and she did not forget the economical side of conserving on thread in her training with hand stitches; for example, in the cross-stitched square, all thread is on top." British Mission ELDER HUGH B. BROWN, recently appointed president of the British Mission, wrote soon after his arrival in England of a mission-wide Relief Society convention held June 17 and 18, 1944, and of the bravery and devotion of these women who live in the war zone. His letter follows: RELIEF SOCIETY WOMEN IN THE WAR ZONE RELIEF Society sisters from all
parts of the British Mission assembled in a mission-wide convention at Birmingham, June 17 and 18. There were representatives present from all the districts and most of the branches, in spite of restrictions NOTES FROM THE FIELD on travel and the difficulties and inconveniences incidental thereto. "Sister Marie W. Anastasiou, president of the Relief Society of the mission, presided, and her counselors, Sister Nellie Poole and Sister Maud Hawkes, took charge of some of the meetings during the proceedings. "Upon walking into the banquet hall on Saturday evening, one felt at once to say, "This does not look like there is a war on!' for although Britain is rigidly rationed and although each family gets coupons for only sufficient for their actual needs, still these frugal sisters of the Relief Society had saved enough by a family rationing system within the national system to enable them to spread before the large numbers who were assembled a very palatable and refreshing meal and, in addition, to serve all the officers and teachers on the following day. "The theme of the conference was 'The Glory of God Is Intelligence,' and some very inspiring addresses were given followed by general discussion. "During the closing session Sister Anastasiou and her board were released with a hearty vote of thanks for their capable leadership during more than four years of strenuous activity.. "Sister Florence B. Dunn was sustained as president of the Relief Society of the British Mission, and she selected Sister Nellie Poole and Sister Maud Hawkes as her two counselors. Sister Dora Smith of the London office staff was sustained as secretary. Sister Dunn has moved to the mission office in London where her husband, Norman Dunn, is acting as mission secretary 591 and she will serve as mission mother as well as Relief Society president. "When one meets with and talks to these brave British mothers, he discovers the source of stamina, fortitude, and courage which has characterized the British people during the years of this searching test. "We read daily in the press and hear hourly on the radio of the deeds of valor of our brave men in the fighting forces. Many do not realize, however, that there are hundreds of Relief Society women in the war zone who have been exposed to dangers, trials and hardships, comparable to that which our men undergo in the battle field. These brave women have carried on in the face of almost insuperable difficulties. They form an army which gives an index to the character of the British people. A strange army it is, made up of grandmothers, mothers with children in their arms, spinsters, and little girls, not in uniform but in all the various colors and fashions worn by the members of various classes of society. Working in the home, in the garden, in the factories, in the Church, smiling through difficulties, seeking shelter when necessary, emerging when the 'all clear' sounds to take up their tasks where they left them, and always with a simple faith and trust in God which is the envy of many stout-hearted men, "To kneel in prayer with these women and to hear them thank God for their simple blessings, for the preservation of their lives and the lives of their loved ones, and for their scanty provisions and their windowless homes is at once an inspiration and a reproof to many of us whose material blessings far exceed any enjoyed here, but who frequently at being deprived of a few luxuries. "While the spirit which I saw in the Relief Society convention continues, democracy and the spirit of the gospel of Christ will live and flourish, and victory for the ideals for which the Church stands will never be in doubt.?
