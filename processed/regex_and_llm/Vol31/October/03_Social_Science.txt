Lesson 3?The Road to Righteousness
Dr. Harold T. Christensen
For Tuesday, January 23, 1945
Lesson link: It was shown last time that happiness or satisfaction is the primary purpose of life and that all human endeavor is directed toward its attainment. It was recognized, however, that satisfactions are relative and that many people deprive themselves of the deeper joys by indulging on the lower pleasure levels. In this they are immoral, for the greatest happiness is also the greatest good. Personal achievement, brotherhood, and health were named as the major conditions of a moral and happy life.
Lesson aim: To expand on the idea of happiness through personal achievement and to show, thereby, that the road to righteousness involves intelligent and progressive living.
WHEN Lehi exclaimed "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25), he spoke not only of the happiness goal in life, but also of the means by which this goal might be reached. It is significant that the purpose of life, joy, is tied up with the fall of Adam; for through the fall man was made to struggle, and by struggle man achieved and he achieved, but only happy. The abundant life of which Christ so often spoke is the joyous life that comes from sacrifice, struggle, and accomplishment.
The Ethics of Progress
All that we are saying here is that happiness and righteousness are contingent upon effort and success. The greatest good and the greatest satisfaction in life come not from indifference, passivity, or laziness; but 604 from enthusiasm, action, and achievement. Individuals may thrill momentarily by taking the easy way, but it is victory over the hard things of life that brings the more permanent and _ lofty _ satisfactions. Morality is active, not passive; and the road to righteousness is paved with resistance and effort, not indulgence and indolence. This basic truth might be reinforced with the following story and analogy: When the writer was a small child he heard and believed in the statement that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for him who can reach it. One day, seeing a tiny rainbow in the waterspray on the front lawn, he decided to go after the pot of gold that he knew must be there. But as he pursued it, the rainbow continually shifted to new locations; and he found himself running here and there in what eventually seemed to be a fruitless chase. He gave up in disappointment. But now as he looks back on this experience with a different perspective he is ready to say that he found the gold. He was not deceived, although he didn't quite understand. At the time. All gold is not tangible. All gold cannot be touched and squeezed and molded as that which he expected to find on that day. Just as gold is the standard of monetary value or material wealth, so happiness is the standard of life's endeavor. While he was chasing this little rainbow as a child, he was having the time of his life; it was fun and that was his reward, that was the gold. And so it is with life; we set our minds on some goal and climb forward; when we reach it our vision only shifts to new unreached heights ahead, and on we go. But as long as we keep climbing, we keep happy. There is a thrill in accomplishment through effort that surges through the souls of men and impels them to greater things. Another analogy is found in mountain climbing. Those who have climbed realize that the higher up one goes the purer is the air and the broader is one's vision of the landscape below. Climbing is hard work, but the view is a reward well worth it. Life is like a mountain peak. The worthwhile things of life lie up ahead and only struggle can bring us to them. Those who are willing to exert the greater effort teach the greater heights, and because of this their view is more serene and their enjoyment more supreme. Progression is eternal for those who ate willing to keep going, and keep going we must if we are to abide the highest righteousness and realize the greatest joy. Dissipation in the frivolities of the day may be fun for awhile, but eventually it will be disappointing, for it can never lead to the joyful heights above. Struggle is the law of growth, and growth or progression is the verv framework of mortality and happiness. When Adam was told that he and his descendants must earn their living through work and sweat, he received a blessing in disguise, for it is only through sweat and effort that man can achieve and grow. Since some of the greatest joy comes from personal progress, so some of the deepest misery comes from the realization of what might-have-been. The moral life is dynamic and progressive. To stand still or slip backward when progress is possible is im- LESSON DEPARTMENT moral because it defeats the higher purposes of life. 'The greater morality is bred from strength not weakness, from victory over difficulties, from faith, and courage, and struggle. By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them There are three levels of human expressions: (1) the covert or mental; (2) the verbal or communicative; and (3) the overt or outward performance. Progressive living implies activity on all three levels, and it especially requires that the mental and verbal activities carry through and bear fruit in terms of actual performance. First of all, if we are interested in personal progress, we must learn to think and to think deeply and straight." There are perhaps millions in the world today who are willing to think scarcely at all; they simply accept and let it go at that. This inactivity of individuality is one of the most serious moral problems of our age, for it smothers initiative and stifles progress. Mental unemployment is probably an even greater drawback to civilization than is economic unemployment, for when the mind remains inactive, personality shrivels?losing thereby its ability to progress and its capacity to enjoy. Other millions think, but allow their thinking to be guided by their desires or emotions alone. This wishful or fantasy thinking, as it is called, leads to fallacious conclusions and wasted or immoral effort. The head should rule the heart when it 605 comes to the serious decisions of life. One of the crying needs of our day is for the development of active and analytical thinking on the part of the masses. But, even if a person thinks and thinks straight, he has accomplished little if that is where he stops. Unless good thinking is transformed into good speaking and good living, it will have been largely wasted effort. Frequently, too, an individual will express his thoughts or intentions on the verbal plane and then stop without any attempt to carry them out. Procrastination is not only the thief of time, but the thief of progression and happiness as well. And laziness is even more immoral than procrastination for, where the one means only delay, the other means never. This tendency. To vocalize or verbalize that which sounds good or that which will get one by, with little intention of carrying it out, is a distortion and a perversion of the ethical life. As Christ said, it is "By their fruits ye shall know them." Thought is the first step in progress, but thought alone is fruitless. Verbal expressions where backed by straight thinking are steps in progress, but unless carried into the field of overt action even they become meaningless. The good life is the life of good thought, good speech, and, above all, good performance. Obedience Plus Righteousness implies obedience to right principles. But this does 1/ If the class leader and others who read these lessons are interested in exploring farther the processes of straight and crooked thinking they will find the following books very helpful: Edwin L. Clarke, The Art of Straight Thinking; and Henry B. Smith, How the Mind Falls Into Error. 606 not mean that a mechanical conformity to detailed rules or commands will lead to the greatest righteousness. As a matter of fact, morality is anything but mechanical, and one of the principles to be obeyed is the principle of growth through original creative expression. Note this: For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward. Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a command-ment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned (Doc. and Gov., Sec. 58:26-29). Righteousness is more than con-formity; iti s a vitality that springs from the core of the soul. The good life is more than personal manner-isms acquired through obedience to prescribed patterns; it is that and something more. It is to reach be-yond mere obedience; it is a plea for obedience plus. Lucifer's plan presented to the council in heaven in the pre-existent sphere would have abolished free agency and forced all to conform to or obey a set procedure. But Lucifer's plan was not accepted and man was made a moral agent responsible for his own acts. Because of this, obedience to a principle is better than obedience to a person; and reasoned obedience leading to original effort beyond bare requirements is more important than insipid con-formity to t he mechanics of moral codes. "The glory of God is intelligence." If this inspiring slogan of the saints is to be anything more than a pleasing verbalism, it must stimulate original and creative think-ing and living. A certain amount of questioning and doubting is necessary in the development of our mental powers, and parents and teachers will do well to understand this in dealing with youth. But this need not mean a loss of faith, especially where the analytical thought processes spring from a basic belief and the desire to understand. It may even mean the building of a deeper and stronger faith; one that is intelligent rather than gullible. Under standing is at the heart of intelligent living, and prayerful but active thinking is back of all understanding. Conformity alone is negative and passive, but righteousness goes farther than this; it is positive and active. When a person thinks he is good just because he conforms, one is tempted to ask,' 'good for what?" Goodness is more than just going through the motions. It is a surging power within that finds expression in creative endeavor. The morality of too many today is sterile because it lacks vision, superficial because it lacks energy. There are too many today who are content to remain on the fringe of righteousness, satisfied with the shell when they could and should have the core. Horizons Beyond So the road to righteousness is up-ward and ahead. There are easier roads to travel, but none that will bring the same satisfaction through the motions it is surging power within that finds expression in creative endeavor The morality of too many today is sterile because it lacks vision, superficial because it lacks energy. There are too may today who are content to remain on the fringe of righteousness, satisfied with the shell when they could and should have the core. Horizons Beyond So the road to righteousness is upward and ahead. There are easier roads to travel, but none that will bring the same satisfaction through LESSON DEPARTMENT accomplishment. Righteousness involves a search which is more than a belief, effort which is more than defense of status quo, initiative which is more than obedience. Belief, defense, and obedience we must have, but the great challenges and opportunities of life lie beyond all of this and supreme joy awaits those who are willing to climb. Little thrills come to those who reach the lower heights, but there are always new horizons beyond, beckoning to those who want the bigger' thrills. And he who climbs the best and the farthest is the most righteous because of it. The creative urge in man awaits expression, but sometimes unfortunately it becomes smothered through ignorance, laziness, or fear. There is a dignity about personality and individuality that defies the straightjacket of rigid standardization or regimentation through conformity alone. The spontaneity of the soul is there to lift men upward if they will but give it a chance. The road to righteousness is the thrilling road of intelligence, industry, and progression. Problems for Thought and Action 1. How are happiness, righteousness, and personal achievement related to each other? Refer to the quotation from Lehi given in the first paragraph of the lesson and see if you can explain why the fall of Adam and the attainment of joy are referred to in the same sentence. Are they related? How? Why is temporary discomfort sometimes necessary to achieve lasting happiness? Why is struggle the law of growth, and growth such an important source of satisfaction? Was the fall of Adam a blessing or a misfortune for mankind? Discuss. 607 2. Name the three levels of human expression and explain which you think is the most important to righteousness. Why is thought the first step in progressive living? What do the expressions "mental unemployment" and "inactivity of individuality" mean to you? Why do they present a serious problem? What is fantasy thinking? Give examples. Why does it hinder progress? Why are intentions alone insufficient for righteousness? In this connection discuss the pros and cons of New Year's resolutions. Discuss procrastination and laziness as obstacles to progress. Would you call them immoral? Why or why not? Why do people profess things they are unable or unwilling to perform? Is it ethical to do this? 3. What do we mean when we say that righteousness is more than conformity? Does "obedience plus" mean disobedience? Why not? 4. In looking ahead to the next lesson think about the problem of free agency and moral responsibility. Assign someone to prepare material on the war in heaven and the doctrine of free agency. Assign another to look up material on predestination and foreordination. Selected References Bennion, Milton, Moral Teachings of the New Testament.
