The Problem
IN 1943 an epidemic of infantile paralysis killed 23 people under the age of 25. This most unusual occurrence provoked tremendous public excitement and sympathy, and facilitated the collection of large sums of money to be used in combating the disease. In the same year rheumatic heart disease killed almost 62 young people in the same age group, and perhaps 200 more older individuals. This was not an unusual thing, as approximately the same number of victims are claimed every year, yet it provoked no public comment, no demands for action, no drives for funds . . .
How does it happen that a disease like infantile paralysis attracts so much attention, while rheumatic heart disease, which kills and cripples from ten to twenty times as many people each year, goes along year after year with very little interference? A comparison of the two diseases may throw some light on this question. When poliomyelitis strikes hard enough to cause any damage, the effect is immediately apparent. The individual is obviously sick, and the evil effects, whether they result in crippling or death, are soon clearly visible. On the contrary, rheumatic heart disease, in most cases, probably has a very insidious
onset, with symptoms so slight as to be unnoticed or disregarded by those who see the child; and it may take anywhere from a few weeks to a few years before someone discovers that the heart has been severely damaged. Few deaths occur in the beginning; in many cases a number of years intervene before the accumulated insults result in failure of the heart. Adults die of injury which was inflicted, and which might have been prevented, in childhood. An attack of infantile paralysis so mild as not to result in crippling within a week or two will not only leave the child without harmful effects, but will protect him against any future attacks; whereas, an attack of so-called rheumatic fever, so mild as to arouse no concern, will not only result in damage to the heart, but will make the child more susceptible to future attacks. The crippling which results from infantile paralysis is usually obvious, and of a type which arouses sympathy in all who observe the unfortunate victim; whereas, a cardiac cripple, unable to proceed down the street at a gait faster than a leisurely walk, will be unnoticed because he wears no brace, carries no crutches, and does not limp.
Case Finding
The first essential in attempting
Page 554 RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE to reduce mortality from this disease is to find the cases. It is not enough to recognize the children who become sick with classical acute rheumatic fever, and who show the obvious findings of fever?red, tender swollen joints, skin rashes, and nodules; or the children acutely ill with dilated hearts, pericardial friction rubs, and signs of failure; or the children with St. Vitus' Dance. Parents and physicians should be on the alert for children with more vague complaints of poor appetite, failure to grow normally, pallor, elevated pulse rate, and so-called "growing pains." Such symptoms should call for very careful examination, supplemented by such time-tested laboratory procedures as sedimentation rates and X-ray studies. A sedimentation rate should be as much of a standard office procedure as a urinalysis or blood count; indeed, it takes less time than either, requires the simplest apparatus, and gives invaluable information in following a case of rheumatic heart disease. Where there is a family history of the disease, it is particularly imperative to be on the alert, and to cultivate an attitude of suspicion towards the mildest complaints. In the past, it may be that too much attention has been directed to the heart, and too little to the whole child. The presence of a heart murmur does not necessarily mean heart disease; nor does the absence of a murmur rule it out. Even in those cases where it is definitely known that the murmur heard is the result of an attack of rheumatic fever at some time in the past, it gives little or no information as to the current status of the rheumatic infection, whether it is active or quiescent. A 555 stop sign at a railroad crossing does not necessarily mean that a train is coming along in the next two minutes, but it does indicate the advisability of looking up and down the track; and a heart murmur should have the same significance. Treatment The second point of attack is proper treatment of the disease. The most important measure available at present?the fundamental measure ?is rest in bed. This has been known for a long time, but it has not generally been realized just how long such periods of bed rest must continue. It is not enough to keep the child at rest until the pain is gone, or until the temperature is normal, or until he feels well; it is necessary to keep him at absolute bed rest?and this means lying down ?until all evidence of rheumatic infection has disappeared, as determined not only by his appearance, pulse rate, appetite, and physical findings, but by the return of the sedimentation rate to normal. This usually requires on the average closer to six months than six weeks, and often longer; and will be followed by a long period of gradually increasing activity before the child is able to resume his normal manner of life. Allowing a child to get out of bed and return to school while there is any evidence, no matter how mild, of rheumatic activity is simply to invite a flare-up of the smouldering disease process. Where can this bed rest be given? In the home? Ask any mother how easy she thinks it would be to keep her active eight year-old son flat in bed for six months. In the hospital? Ask any hospital administrator how many 556 beds he can afford to tie up for six months?particularly in these days. Ask the children who are there, exposed to cross infections, with no provision for entertainment or education, spending their time watching other luckier children with appendicitis or pneumonia go home after ten days. Neither of these is satisfactory. The proper treatment of rheumatic heart disease requires ideally a special type of institution, preferably with facilities for both the acute and convalescent cases, with ample provision for continuing their education and maintaining their morale. As a step in this direction, some communities are fortunate enough to possess convalescent hospitals, which can furnish care for children with a wide variety of crippling conditions, including those with rheumatic heart disease and infantile paralysis... Prevention Finally, there is the matter of prevention. It is unfortunate that we do not possess any vaccine which protects against the disease, such as we have to protect us against diphtheria, smallpox, and other plagues. We do know, however, that a rheumatic child will have fewer recurrences if he lives in clean, hygienic surroundings, receives a complete and well-balanced diet, and is protected against infections, particularly against those caused by the hemolytic streptococcus. The prophylactic use of salicylates and sulfonamides is now being tested, but their proponents have not yet advocated their general use. Parenthetically, it should be pointed out that all authorities on the subject are unanimous in their condemnation of the use of sulfonamide drugs in the acute or active stages of the disease.
