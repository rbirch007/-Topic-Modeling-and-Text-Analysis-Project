Sketch Of My Life Eliza R. Snow Smith CHAPTER II IN the Spring of 1858, when through persecution, the Saints were compelled to leave Kirtland, with my father's family I moved to Adam-ondi-Ahman, Daviess Co. Mo., where we arrived on, or about the last of July. But our stay was short?a fierce mob violence, with which all departments of the State authorities, civil, judicial, and military participated, so soon manifested itself, that before the year closed, in submission to the Governor's order, we moved from Daviess Co., to Caldwell; and, on the 5th of March, started enroute for Illinois. A few days before leaving Adam-ondi-Ahman, the former owner of the house, for which my father had paid in full, came in, and impudently enquired how soon we should be out of it. My American blood warmed to the temperature of an insulted, free-born American citizen as I looked at him and thought, poor man; you little know with whom you have to deal?God lives. He certainly over-ruled in that in- stance, for the original owners of two homesteads which my father paid for, although they had made arrangements for mobbing us, previous to the purchase, never regained possession.
The Governor gave us ten days' notice to prepare and leave Daviess County, and in the mean-time, sub- servient to his order a posse of Militia was to remain in the vicinity, ostensibly to protect the Saints; but we could not decide which was most to be dreaded, the Militia or the mob?no property was safe within the reach of either. It was December and very cold when we left our home, and, after assisting in the morning arrangements for the journey, in order to warm my aching feet, I started on foot and walked until the teams came up. When about two miles out, I met one of the so-called Militia who accosted me with, "Well, I think this will cure you of your faith." "Looking him squarely in the eye, I replied, "No Sir, it will take more than this to cure me of my faith." His countenance dropped, and he responded, "I must confess you are a better soldier than I am." I passed on, thinking that, unless he was above the average of his fellows in that section, I was not complimented by his confession.
In recording the following incident, I wish to perpetuate the re-membrance of the only expression of sympathy which, to my knowledge, was uttered by the former citizens of Mo. in our behalf, from the commencement of our persecutions in that State, till our final expulsion. On our outward journey, after a night of rain, which changed to snow and covered the ground in the morning, we thawed our tent which was stiffly frozen, by holding and turning it alternately before a blazing fire, until it could be folded for packing, and, while we all shivered and shook with cold, we started. See Doctrine and Covenants, Sec 116. 207  See ADAM-ONDI-AHMAN Thirty acres of land, including the whole of this hill on which are the ruins of the altar of Adam, have recently been purchased by the Church.. As the sun mounted upwards the snow melted and increased the depth of the mud, with which the road before us was previously amply stocked, and rendered travel almost impossible. The teams were puffing and the wagons dragging so heavily that we were all on foot, tugging along as best we could, when an elderly gentleman on horseback overtook us, and after riding along-side for some time, apparently absorbed in deep thought, as he (after enquiring who we were) with apparent interest, watched women and girls, men and boys, teams and wagons slowly winding their way up a long hill, enroute from our only -earthly homes, with no prospect before us, he said emphatically, "If I were in your places, I should want the Governor of the State hitched at the head of my teams." I afterwards remarked to my father that I had not heard as sensible remark from a stranger since entering the State. In my memory, from that time to this, I have cherished a filial respect for that gentleman, and fancy I see a striking resemblance of him in the portrait of Sir Von Humboldt, now hanging on the wall in front of me. We arrived in Quincy, Illinois, where many of the exiled Saints had preceded us, and all were received with generous hospitality. My father moved to one of the northern Counties, I stopped in Quincy, and while there wrote for the Press several articles, for which I received many encomiums, with urgent solicitations for effusions, which, probably were elicited by the fact that my articles were productions SKETCH OF MY LIFE from the pen of a "Mormon girl." From Quincy, my sister, her two daughters and I went to Lima, Hancock Co., where we found a temporary home under the roof of an old veteran of the Revolution, who, with his family, treated us with much kindness; although through ignorance of the character of the Saints, their feelings were like gall towards them, which we knew to be the result of misrepresentation. Occupying as we did, an upper room with a slight flooring between us and the occupants below, we were obliged to hear bitter aspersions against those whom we knew to be the best people on earth. Frequently our host, after vilely traducing our people, of whom he knew nothing, suddenly changed his tone and boasted of the "two noble women" he had in his house?"no better women ever lived," etc., which he would have said of the "Mormons" generally, had he made their acquaintance. We were pilgrims, and for the time had to submit to circumstances. Almost anything innocent is preferable to dependence?with these people we could earn our support at the tailoring business: thanks to my mother's industrial training, for which, even now I bless her dear memory. IN May, the Saints commenced gathering in Commerce, (afterwards Nauvoo) and on the 16th of July following, I left our kind host and hostess, much to their regret, Elder Rigdon having sent for me to teach his family school in Commerce, and, although I regretted the separation from my sister, I was truly thankful to be again associated 209 ed with the body of the Church. The location of the city of Nauvoo was beautiful, but the climate was so unhealthy that several efforts had been made to build it up, and as many times abandoned. It seemed to have been held in reserve to meet the occasion, for none but Saints full of faith, and trusting in the power of God, could have established that city. Through the blessings of our Heavenly Father on the indefatigable exertions of the Saints, it was not long before Nauvoo excited the envy and jealousy of many of the adjacent inhabitants, and, as "the accuser of the brethren" never sleeps, we had many difficulties to meet which ultimately culminated in the most bitter persecution. To narrate what transpired within the seven years, in which we built and occupied Nauvoo, the beautiful, would fill many volumes. That is a history that never will, and never can "repeat itself.' Some of the most important events of my life transpired within that brief term, in which I was married, and in which my husband, Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, sealed his testimony with his blood! When in March, 1842, Joseph Smith, assisted by some of the leading Elders, organized the "Female Relief Society of Nauvoo," I was present, and was appointed Secretary of the Institution. In the following summer, I accompanied Mrs. Emma Smith, the President, to Quincy, Illinois, with a Petition signed by several hundred members of the Society, praying His Excellency, Governor Carlin, for protection from illegal suits then pending  THE OLD SMITH HOME AT NAUVOO against the Prophet, Joseph Smith. We met with a very cordial reception?presented our petition, which the Governor received with manifestations of sympathetic sincerity, pledging his word and honor that he would use his influence to protect Mr. Smith, whose innocence he fully acknowledged. But alas! Soon after our return, we learned that at the time of our visit, and while making protestations of friendship, the wily Governor was secretly conniving with the basest of men to destroy our leaders. The awful tragedy of the 27th of June, 1844, is a livid, burning, scathing stain on our national escutcheon. To look upon the noble, lifeless forms of those brothers, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, lying side by side, after having been brought home from Carthage, where they had been slaughtered in their manhood and in their innocence, was a sight that might well appeal the heart of a true American citizen: but, what it was for loving wives and children, the loyal heart may feel, but let language keep silence! This scene occurred in America, "The land of the free, and the home of the brave," to which our ancestors fled for religious freedom? where the "Dear old Flag" yet waves; and under which not one effort has been made by the authorities of either County, State, or General Government, to bring the perpetrators of that notorious murder to justice. The expulsion of the Saints from the State of Ill., soon followed after SKETCH OF MY LIFE the deaths of the Prophet and Patriarch, On my first arrival in Nauvoo, (then Commerce) I resided in the family of Elder Rigdon?taught his family school?was with his mother (who lived with him) at her death ?attended her funeral on the 6th of Oct., the first Conference held in Ill. In the following winter my father came for me?I went home with him?found my mother suffering from hardships and exposures through mobocracy. The next Spring my father moved to La-harpe, 30 ms. From Nauvoo?remained there one year, then moved to Nauvoo. My home was with the family until father exchanged his home for one in Walnut Grove, 75 ms. From Nauvoo; a settlement where a Stake of the Church had been appointed. After my parents moved, I lived with the Prophet's first wife, and taught a school of 65 scholars. Before its close, I went and boarded with brother and sister Holmes for a short time, and previous to the exodus of the Saints from Ill. I lived in the family of Col. Stephen Markham. Much of the winter of 1845-6 I spent officiating in the Temple? the upper part of which was sufficiently completed for administering the sacred ordinances of the holy Priesthood as God had revealed them. ON the 13th of Feb. 1846, with Sister Markham, I crossed the Mississippi on a ferry-boat, and joined the camp of the Saints, three miles from the river, where we found wood and water in abundance. I was informed that on the first night of the encampment of those who preceded us, nine children were 21 ushered into the world; and from that time, as we journeyed, mothers gave birth to offspring under almost every variety of circumstances except those to which they had been accustomed?in tents and wagons? in rain-storms, and in snow-storms. I heard of one birth occurring in the rude shelter of a hut?the sides formed of blankets fastened to poles stuck in the ground?a bark roof, through which the rain was dripping: Kind sisters held dishes and caught the water?thus protecting the mother and her little darling from a shower-bath on its entrance to the stage of human existence. Had not this, as well as many others, been a case of necessity, no other result than death could have been anticipated, to both mother and child. Let it be remembered that the mothers referred to, were not savages, accustomed to roam the forest and brave the storm and tempest? those who had never known the comforts and delicacies of civilization and refinement. They were not those who, in the wilds of nature, nursed their offspring amid reeds and rushes, or in the obscure recesses of rocky caverns. Most of them were born and educated in the Eastern States?had there embraced the Gospel as taught by Jesus and His Apostles, and for its sake had gathered with the Saints; and under trying circumstances, assisted by their faith, energies and patience in making Nauvoo what its name indicates, "The Beautiful." 'There they had lovely homes?decorated with flowers, and enriched with choice fruit trees, just beginning to yield plentifully. To these homes, without lease or sale, they had bid a final adieu, and, with what little of their  NAUVOO MANSION?LAST HOME OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH substance could be packed into one, two, and perhaps in a few instances, three wagons, had started out desert ward, for where? To this question, the only response at that time was, God knows. From the 13th to the 18th several snow-storms occurred, and the cold was so intense as to bridge the Mississippi river sufficiently for the passage of heavily loaded wagons. The men built huge fires, and when not necessarily otherwise engaged, warmed themselves around the crackling blaze. The women, when the labors of cooking and other etceteras did not prompt them outside, huddled with their small children, into wagons and carriages for protection from chilling breezes. My dormitory, sitting-room, writing office, and frequently dining-room, was the buggy in which Mrs. Markham, her little son, David, and I rode. With the best I could do for myself, I frosted my feet which occasioned me considerable inconvenience for several weeks. On the 28th we moved out. Previous to breaking camp, (all who designed traveling in the first company had crossed the river, numbering from six to seven hundred), they were partially organized into tens, fifties, and hundreds, which was afterwards completed for the order of traveling; with Captains, Pioneers, Superintendents, and Commissioners, to each hundred, and Captains over each fifty, and ten. We traveled four miles and put up for the night when the prospect, at first sight was dreary enough. It was nearly sun-set?very cold, with four or five inches of snow on the ground: but with brave hearts, strong hands, and plenty of spades and shovels, the men removed the snow, and suddenly transformed the bleak desert into a joyous town SKETCH OF MY LIFE of cloth houses with log-heap fires, and a multitude of cheerful inhabitants. The next day the Nauvoo Band came up, and its stirring strains were wafted abroad and reechoed on the responsive breeze. From time to time, companies of men either volunteered or were detailed from the journeying camps, and by going off the route, found jobs of work, and obtained food for the people and grain for the teams. As we passed through a town on the Des Moines, the inhabitants manifested as much curiosity as though viewing a menagerie of wild beasts. Their levity and apparent heartlessness was proof of profound ignorance. How little did they comprehend our movement and the results which the Almighty had in view! On the 2nd of March we again moved forward, and our encampment this night may truly be recorded as a miracle on natural principles, and yet, very strikingly peculiar?a city reared in a few hours, and everything in operation that living required, and many additional ones, which, if not extravagances were conveniences. The next day, great numbers of people in companies 213 were in from the adjacent country patrolling our anonymous streets, viewing our unique city, with astonishment visible in their countenances. In the evening sister Markham and I took a stroll abroad, and in the absence of street names, and tent Nos. we lost our way, and had to be piloted within sight of our own domicile. At this point Col. Markham exchanged our buggy for a lumber wagon, in order to assist others in carrying freight; and in performing this act of generosity, so filled the wagon, as to give us barely room to sit in front. This wagon, with bags piled on bags, was my sleeping room ?the family lodged in other wagons and ina tent. Instead of comfort, necessity was the order of the move, and the best faculty for adaptation to circumstances, the best inheritance. We were thankful to be so well off?fleeing from persecution, we were in pursuit of a land of peace. The mob in the vicinity of Nauvoo, knowing that I wielded the pen, had threatened my life, lest, as they said, I should write about the tragic scene at Carthage. Although I had neither fear nor dread of death, I felt as I expressed in the following: LET US GO Let us go?let us go to the wilds for a home Where the wolf and the roe and the buffalo roam? Where beneath our own vines, we in peace, may enjoy The fruits of our labors, with none to annoy. Let us go?let us go where our Rights are secure? Where the waters are clear and the atmosphere pure? Where the hand of oppression has never been felt? Where the blood of the prophets has never been spilt.  Let us go?let us go where the Kingdom of God Will be seen in its Order extending abroad? Where the Priesthood of heaven, unopposed will go forth In the regeneration of man and of earth.  When we started again, Mrs. M. [Markham] and I were seated on a chest with bran-kettle and soap-box for our foot-stools, and were happy, and well might be, in comparison with some of our sisters who walked all day, rain or shine, and at night prepared supper for their families, with no sheltering tents; and then made their beds in, and under wagons that contained their earthly all. Frequently with intense sympathy and admiration I watched the mother when, forgetful of her own fatigue and destitution, she took unwearied pains to fix up in the most palatable form the allotted portion (most of the time we were rationed ) of food, and as she dealt it out, was cheering the hearts of her children, while, as I truly believed, her own was lifted to God in fervent prayer that their lives might be preserved, and, above all, that they might honor Him in the religion for which she was an exile from the home once sacred to her, for the sake of those precious ones which God had committed to her care.
