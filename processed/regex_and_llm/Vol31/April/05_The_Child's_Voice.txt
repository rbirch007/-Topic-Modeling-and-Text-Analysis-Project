The Child's Voice and His Early Musical Experiences Florence Jepperson Madsen Member of Relief Society General Board OW like tinkling bells is the laughter of children, and how like sweet-toned flutes, their song. We think of song as the outward expression of an inner joy and happiness, a way of expressing thought more beautifully. 'There seems no limit, however, to the various moods that can be expressed through song? that of reverence affection, grief, longing or patriotism; still, the initial impulse to sing comes from the exhilaration of joy and happiness The normal child is radiant, happy, and ever ready for self-expression. He is unhampered by inhibitions and traditions; therefore, he yields readily to any of his natural impulses. Poets have likened him to an April day which brings sunshine, rain, and song all in a single hour. His introduction to learning is in the home. It is here that he sees and hears the things after which he will pattern. His world is one of imitation and imagination. From the environment in which he lives he takes on many of the character traits which will be his companions throughout life. The first contact the child has with sound is undoubtedly the speaking voices round about him. If he is compelled to listen to loud and harsh sounds, his concept of tone will be distorted. If on the other hand, he hears gentle and sweet-sounding voices, he will emerge into his speaking world with a model of beautiful sound. When we consider that song is really perfected speech set to music, we can appreciate more fully how important it is to give attention to this thought. Shakespeare was impressed with the value of a beautiful speaking voice when he wrote, "Her voice was ever soft, gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman." The same thing might apply to man, granting him, of course, more latitude with volume. "Whether it be for good or evil, the education of the child is principally derived from its own observation of the actions, words, voice and looks of those with whom it lives." The above lines were penned by Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb. A similar thought was voiced by the French writer Joubert, when he said, "Children have more need of models than of critics." Because of the immaturity of children's voices, special care is required in the presentation of songs. They ought always to be pitched in an easy range of the voice and sung with a medium volume. Low notes are quite as harmful as high ones. Page 215 216 Loud singing will strain youthful voices, take away their sweetness, and leave them unmusical and harsh sounding. It is generally thought best to confine the range of their songs within the limits of the treble clef. During the preschool period, nursery songs and others of a similar type are best suited to children. Later, one may add some of the easy Primary 'and Junior Sunday School songs. It is best to avoid songs with many stanzas because they cause mental strain, confusion, and fatigue. The thought content should lie within the scope of the child's comprehension and experience. Because of the wide variety of children's interests, it is comparatively easy to choose interesting song subjects. They love birds, flowers, mountains, trees, boats, colors, people, and God and all His great creation. Young folk need to be impressed with the simplicity and naturalness of singing, that they may participate with ease and enjoyment, and that each may treasure his God-given vocal instrument, which has been called the king of all instruments. The one whose responsibility it is to teach songs to children should be watchful that their posture, when standing or sitting, is good, and that the singing is done with free and open mouths. NE is indeed fortunate who, in his impressionable years, is privileged to hear good music in his home. Unknowingly, he acquires, through his auditory sense, an acquaintance with and an interest in the various mediums of musical expression, With this background he approaches his musical subjects in school with comparative ease and increasing interest. Members of the family should listen patiently and sympathetically to the child's least efforts of musical expression, and praise and encourage him no matter how seemingly insignificant these efforts appear. He may choose his own tune instead of the conventional one. The variety of pitches he uses may be so limited that it greatly worries the listeners. There is no particular need for concern over this during the child's early years, because his sense of pitch discrimination has not yet been stabilized. He must have experiences and contacts with musical sounds in order to develop his power of pitch discrimination. His music training in school will further assist in developing this latent talent. It is well to impress upon the minds of the young the real beauty of tone by often giving them examples of sweet, melodious singing ?a lone voice or a group?violin, flute, and harp solos, string or woodwind ensembles, or any other well-chosen music which emphasizes the effectiveness of lovely tone. Children should have the opportunity, wherever possible, to attend fine musicals. Where performers cannot be heard in person, recordings can be substituted. In choosing records, care should be taken to select those that fit the age group of the listeners and that have within them interesting rhythmic patterns and appealing melodies. There are many such records available which would be a worthy addition to any record library in the home, and THE CHILD'S VOICE would give the child a feeling of importance to possess and play. THE child should always feel that music is something to enjoy, that it is fun and not work. It is important, first of all, that an interest in music be created and stimulated and that it be well established before technical requirements are made. Fortunately, music can fit into any phase of activity?as background for rhythmic games, marching, dancing, storytelling, pageantry, dramatizations, etcetera. This group participation is most valuable for children as it gives those with pronounced talent a chance to develop leadership. It is equally valuable for the shy and musically backward child because it safeguards his efforts and helps him to develop accuracy and self-confidence. The correlation of music with other subjects in our modern educational system is giving children stimulation to engage in research and fact finding, and to become acquainted with names of musicians and composers, instruments, organizations, and simple musical terms. Even in the study of a simple folk song, many other interesting facts can be learned; such as, what a folk song is; who the composer is, his nationality; the customs and habits of his people, their dress, language; the color and design of their flag; outstanding industries or products of the country; all of which tend to add to the pupil's general knowledge and give him a broader viewpoint and new interests. This procedure need not be confined to the school room alone, but should be paralleled in the home, for 217 it is, after all, the interest and guidance of parents that direct the child into the paths he will tread. He will be strengthened by finding that his interests are shared and supported by others of his family. Parents should urge their children to learn all they can about music and the fine arts as they travel through their school years. These cultural subjects will give them refinement and aesthetic taste, and attune them to the value of appreciation of the finer things of life.
