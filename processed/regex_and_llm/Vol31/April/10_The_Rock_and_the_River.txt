The Rock and the River Ezra J. Poulsen PART TWO RISES are often precipitated through failure to disentangle properly the various threads of circumstance which sometimes get at cross purposes with the skein of life. Difficult as it is to understand human actions, it is even more difficult to estimate correctly the true motive back of the act, especially when emotion confuses reason, and the very violence of the feeling strikes down the better judgment. John Mansfield began to realize this, as he faced the starkly terrifying fact of his daughter's disappearance. Could it be, he wondered, that he had unwittingly made certain the very thing that he had wished to avoid? Had she gone away with Dale Weyman? Or would she meet him at the first opportunity? He didn't pretend to see anything objectionable in the young man. It was the principle involved. No girl should become infatuated with a man she has known only a few days, especially in times like these, he reflected a thousand times a day, as he ran his tractor plow along the easy, mellow slopes of his dry farm up against the foothills; or as he brought the cows up from the big meadow pasture at milking time. It's perfectly foolish to allow girls to chase after soldiers the way they're doing. But maybe I was a little hard on her, he admitted to himself. "There is no doubt about that," said Julia, when he finally confessed. This much to her. "I have no quarrel Page 226 with your purpose, John; but your method is cruel and unjust," she complained in a quivering voice. "You're just like a rock." He knew she was thinking of the familiar granite rock projecting from the hill, but she failed to mention it. Likewise, he was comparing her with the soft meandering river. He loved her for the very qualities he regarded as weaknesses, but made no mention of the fact. Instead, he struggled with a fresh burst of indignation, as the picture of Bonnie in the arms of the young soldier again flashed across his mind. But where to find Bonnie, that was the urgent problem. They searched diligently through the neighborhood, thinking she might be with some of her friends. But they were unsuccessful. Not only John, but Julia, and Jack searched, and waited until they were hollow-eyed and spent. Jack sent a telegram to Dale Weyman, demanding to know if Bonnie had gone with him. A reply, denying any knowledge of her whereabouts and professing deep. Concern, promptly came back. "Well, that's that," remarked Jack, turning his level gray eyes toward his mother. "She hasn't eloped." "Of course she hasn't." Mrs. Mansfield looked at her son, conscious of his close-knit, muscular body, so much like his father, yet so much more pliable?more like herself, THE ROCK AND THE RIVER she thought with motherly pride. "Bonnie would never elope ?not unless she was driven to it; she has always been willing to talk over her problems with me." Her husband, coming into the kitchen through the back door, heard her remark. "Nothing except her father's abuse and harshness would have made her elope, or even run away," he said bitterly. He paused a moment; his face, covered with a three days' growth of beard, was also powdered grayish-black by the fine dust from a windy afternoon's plowing. Even his thin, brown hair seemed to lose half of its identity in the grime, which concentrated moistly in his nostrils, and at the corners of his straight mouth and bloodshot eyes. "She deliberately disobeyed me. And you should have seen them." "Well now, just what did you see?" demanded Julia, ready to test this inference to the utmost, as he disappeared into the bathroom. Almost at the same instant, however, the roaring of the water through the faucets into the bathtub drowned out any answer he might have made. Je put on her straw hat and went out to feed the chickens, and Jack jumped into the car to go for the evening mail. John felt unhappily alone, as he scrubbed himself in the tub. A heavy weight seemed dragging at his heart, and a strained dryness parched his throat. Lifting the warm water to his face in his cupped hands, he dashed away the trace of a tear. But a new surge of emotion swept over him, shaking him like a reed. At last, a dry, difficult sob escaped his lips; and he covered his face in his hands. "Dear 227 God, please help me to find my little girl," he muttered, "and forgive me if I did wrong." For the first time in years, his unyielding nature softened, and he cried like a child. He was much refreshed in body and spirit when he emerged from the bathroom in clean clothes. Jack drove into the yard and called loudly to his mother. "Look, Mother, I've got some letters." John Mansfield dashed through the living room and down the front porch. He could see Jack holding up the letters; he could see Julia running from the opposite direction; and though he felt a twitch of pain that his son and his wife seemed closer to one another than to him, he didn't pause an instant. "Is there any news about Bonnie?" he demanded. Jack broke into a hilarious grin. "See, I got my draft notice," he cried. "I have to leave next week." Seeing his mother and father stop in their tracks, almost as if they had been struck, he changed his tone. "Forgive me, Mother and Dad. Yes, yes, I've heard something about Bonnie. Frank Davidson says he thinks he saw her at Hathaway. He believes she's working in the arms plant there." He pushed an opened letter into his mother's trembling fingers. "It's from Frank. Read it. Nothing too certain, but it's a clue." "We'll go, then; we'll go to Hathaway. It's only sixty miles. Can't we go tonight?" Jack looked with compassion upon his father's worn, haggard face. "Yes, Dad, but I think we'd better wait till morning." "No. I'm ready to go right now." He faced his wife and son in an attitude of command; they returned his 228 severe gaze in protesting silence. In a moment his face softened; the granite in him seemed to melt. "Well, if you think it best to wait, we will." He turned to Julia. Mrs. Mansfield came Over and slipped her arm through his. "I think we'd better wait until we get the chores done in the morning. Hen, we can get some one to take care of things till we get back," "That is a good idea," he admitted. "Let's take she coaxed. At first he resisted, feeling that she was Preparing to lecture him. Finally, he accepted, and she led the way down the lane toward the pasture, "Well, if you don't mind," he remarked, with a quick recognition of Practical things, "you can go with me to get the cows." a little walk, John," "That's just what I'm offering to } do," she declared, glancing up at him with a conscious air of coquetry. "You used to like me to go with you." "I never wanted you more than now," he insisted. 'He clasped his fingers tightly through hers, and drew her closer. "With Jack going, and?Bonnie gone, | get almost frightened to think how much J need you." Julia gave him a wry smile. "'Sthat all?" she probed. "No." He became swiftly aware of her attractive, slenderish form, her smooth skin, and brown hair, with scarcely a strand of gray in it. In her cool gingham dress and drooping straw hat, which she removed when he kissed her, she was still far more girlish than matronly, He wanted to tell her she was beautiful, but the throat, "Oh, John, you can't make love, can you?" she reprimanded gently. A sharp pang of regret struck him for not having said what he had desired to say. But now it was too late. He' felt forced to let his reticence close in on him. They reached the Pasture as the words stuck in his "Yes, maybe it will." "Don't you think the sunset is beautiful?" she chattered, "Surely." He was beginning to stow amazed. Julia, he was sure, had something in mind; but he was at a loss to know what. "Let's go over to the big bend below the rapids," she insisted, "Just as you Say." They were threading their way along damp, meandering cow trails, skirted by masses of birch and willows. She led the way. He followed. Eventually, they reached a sward of green grass, surrounded by cottonwoods. She began to run; flingin back a gay challenge. And half bashfully he pursued, increasing his speed as she increased hers. He caught her, panting and on the short cropped grass close to 'How romantic!" cried Julia when she could catch her breath. "Now, I THE ROCK AND THE RIVER know you're not as old as you sometimes seem." Beyond the river, the sunset was pouring a golden spray directly upon the cliff of granite below the ridge. "Look," she cried, "I do believe the sun is melting the rock."
"Maybe so," he laughed, raking his mind for a suitable retort about the river. But he was too slow.
"But look at the river," she challenged in a soft voice, as she nestled close to him. "Isn't it wonderful? Just like life. It flows on and on? forever."
"Certainly," he countered, in a tone of sudden mastery. "but the river is always going downhill. Now, look at the rock. See how it stands immovable against all the winds that blow; see how it resists the storm." He was quite surprised at his own eloquence, and was about to celebrate his triumph by a mocking laugh, but again Julia beat him by throwing in the element of surprise.
"That's right, John. I love those qualities, especially in you." She had never admitted this before, and he felt so awkwardly thrown off balance that he wished he had not mentioned the rock.
"John," murmured Julia, after a long pause.
"Yes, Dear."
"Do you remember it was here you proposed to me years ago?"
"Huh? Oh, yes, so it was." He held her with a sudden fervor of emotion.
"And, John?" she whispered, in a quick little burst of emotion.
"Yes?"
"What do you think Dale said to Bonnie, when they stopped by the river?"
He gulped, dumbfounded at her
audacity. Then, he laughed; they both laughed, and when they went back up through the pasture, hand in hand, they seemed like two children.
IN Hathaway, the small railroad city suffering the growing pains of becoming an important industrial center due to the pressure of war and the location of a number of vital war enterprises within its boundaries, John and Julia Mansfield found it extremely difficult to follow their ship concerning Bonnie. In the first place, the city was hopelessly overcrowded. War workers were sandwiched in everywhere. Furthermore, it was very hard, because of strict rules, to visit the plants and make inquiry. Finally, neither John nor Julia found it easy to adjust to the hurry and confusion; and as Jack had decided the last minute to stay home and do the chores, they didn't have his help. Not until they had asked many a question of many strangers, who proved to be little better acquainted with the city than they, did they discover, by means of the telephone directory, a family with whom they had a slight acquaintance. With the help they received from this source, they succeeded, the following day, in finding Bonnie's boarding house; but upon hurrying there, they were disappointed again. She was at work and would not be off shift until evening.
"Waiting is the hardest job in the world," complained John, as they sat in their parked car. "In fact, if I had waited in the first place until I was less angry, this would not have happened. Of course she won't want to see me when she comes." 230 Julia was impressed by his repentant attitude. She slipped her hand in his. "Now, Dear," she said softly, "you know that Bonnie thinks the world of her dad." "T used to think so; but now I feel that there's a great gulf between us." "Bonnie can jump over that gulf if you can," declared Julia. "But?but I'm still opposed to young Weyman," he answered doggedly. "She has no_ business taking up with a young fellow we know no more about. You know religion plays an important part in our lives, and we've taught our children to believe that marriage is a sacred institution." Julia was silent a moment. "Of course, John," she said at last. "A careless marriage with someone whose ideals were not like our own would be unthinkable, and would certainly end in disappointment, if not tragedy. But?" she looked up hopefully, almost gaily, "maybe Bonnie's forgotten him already. Then, on the other hand, it could be that he might turn out to be just the kind of man we'd like Bonnie to marry. You know time and patience, John, settle so many difficulties. If we just keep our heads and do the tight thing today, tomorrow is usually very promising." "Well, yes." A bus stopped at the corner, and people began to pile out. Julia was instantly on the sidewalk, waiting breathlessly. John followed her. In another minute, Bonnie appeared among the straggling crowd; and seeing her mother, she ran into her arms with a startled cry. Weeks of loneliness and homesickness found expression in a flood of tears. But when she faced her father, she stood rigidly silent, and doubtful, until he swept her into his arms. 'Then, she cried softly, while he stroked her blonde head and whispered terms of endearment, at the same time noting the tired, worried expression on his daughter's face. When Bonnie took her parents into her room, which, they quickly discovered, she occupied with several other girls, the first thing that they observed was the picture of Dale Weyman, neatly framed and occupying a prominent place on the radio cabinet. "So you're still thinking of him?" tested John, when he had an opportunity. "I'm writing to him, Father," she replied rather stiffly. He didn't try to argue. It remained for Julia to have a long talk with their daughter that evening. "We'd like you to come back home. We'll be so lonesome without you, especially after Jack goes. Besides, I don't know how we'll run the farm. That's war work, too, you know." "But you're still opposed to Dale?" 'There was a quiet dignity in Bonnie's manner which her mother respected as the most perfect evidence of her daughter's maturing womanhood. "Time will reveal the right thing for you and Dale," assured her mother wisely. "Time, and your own faith?and honest prayer." "How grand of you to say that, Mother," cried Bonnie. "If dad only felt the same way, I could not ask for more." "Dad does feel the same way," declared an indulgent voice at the door. Bonnie looked up to see her father enter. "Oh, Dad, you darling," she THE ROCK AND THE RIVER cried, throwing her arms around his neck. "Forgive for running away; and forgive me for all my hard though should have known you'd feel hat way really, and I never thought of expecting more." You released why, I can do farm."
