Easter In Wartime Elder Stephen L Richards Member of the Council of the Twelve WHEN Easter comes in this sad year of 1944, it will bring a message sorely needed in the homes of the land and the nations of the earth. The message emanates from the central fact in the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ?His resurrection from the grave. The record of this transcendent event will be recited for us again, how, following His crucifixion and the mutilation of His body, Jesus was taken from the cross and laid in the sepulchre of a friend, there wrapped in burial clothes and His body anointed with embalming spices; how, after such laying away, a stone was placed to close the entrance to the sepulchre and Roman guards stationed to guard it; how, in the early morn of the third day following His cruel death, the stone was rolled away by an angel who so frightened the guards. That they ran away in great fear and consternation; how His intimate friends came shortly thereafter to perform further kindly offices for Him and, in astonishment, discovered He was gone; how He first appeared and brought comfort and reassurance to the woman who loved Him and how, thereafter, He established to the satisfaction of other friends and strangers, too, some doubting, the reality of His life after death and the literal fulfillment of His remarkable prophecy, then so vaguely comprehended, that He should be killed, but "he shall rise the third day" (Mark 9:31). This profoundly impressive story will be retold on Easter Day. There is within it more significance for the life and happiness of man than in any other circumstance of which we have record, unless it be in the account of man's creation as the son of God. It is out of this marvelous event in the life of Jesus that we derive the supreme blessing of humankind, the immortality of the soul, and eternal life with God. The inestimable blessing of the resurrection inures to all. Every man, woman, and child who has lived or who will live is the beneficiary, "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (I Corinthians 15:22). It is interesting to note that in this record no mention is made of any requirement on the part of man to qualify himself to receive the blessing of the resurrection. It will come to all men through the atonement of Christ irrespective of the things they do in life. Everyone will come forth hereafter to receive judgment for the works he has wrought. It is universal. Mention is made of an order in the resurrection of people?some will come forth before others but, in the end, every spirit will be Page 195 196 reunited with an immortal body to constitute an eternal, living soul. But universal resurrection, all important and beneficent as it is, is not the only boon which comes to humanity through the Savior of the world. A full understanding of His Gospel brings a concept of life after death as vital to the enduring happiness of man as the fact of the resurrection itself. 'This concept is of comparatively recent origin in the history of Christianity. To the student of Christian doctrine, it must seem strange that its coming was so long delayed. BEFORE the advent of Joseph Smith there seems to have been no well-defined distinction between what has later been termed general salvation and individual exaltation in the life to come. There was undoubtedly widespread recognition of the doctrine that men would be rewarded in Heaven for their good deeds in the flesh, but there appears to have been much confusion between the gift of the resurrection brought about by the atonement of Christ and these rewards for individual goodness to which men may look forward. It remained for the Prophet of the last dispensation to bring clarity out of this confusion and to bring understanding to the Savior's statement, "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.... That where I am, there ye may be also" (John 14:2-3), This clarifying revelation was given to the Prophet Joseph in 1832. From it, it was made plain that there are preferential places and stations in the life to come, as there are in this life. The kingdoms or glories into which men may go after the resurrection are therein specified, as are also the conditions which must be fulfilled to enter them. In this and other modern revelations it is made clear that obedience to all the principles of the Gospel of Christ is essential, not as a condition for the resurrection, which comes to all, but as a prerequisite to entrance into the celestial or highest kingdom of the hereafter. It is pointed out that there are gradations of glory or reward for all, according to the lives they lead, but the highest attainment is eternal life in the kingdom where God and Christ dwell. The ordinances and laws of the Gospel are essential for entrance into that kingdom, and it is the function of the established Church of Christ to perform the required ordinances. The import of this and other latter-day revelations is not that all must belong to the re-established Church of Christ and receive the ordinances in it administered to come forth in the new life of the resurrection and attain what is sometimes called general salvation through the grace and the atonement of the Savior, but that acceptance of the restored Gospel and obedience thereto are indispensable to the attainment of the highest glory in the hereafter available to man. On the assumption that it is natural for every man to want the. Best, he can achieve that ambition only by complying with the rules by which it is attainable. So today, the members of the Church of Christ give thanks to Almighty God not only for the immeasurable gift of immortality through the resurrection EASTER IN WARTIME but also for the incomparably beautiful and desirable prospect of exaltation in the celestial kingdom through the Gospel of the Son of God. How sorely the world needs today the blessings which come from these eternal Gospel truths. We are en-gaged in a great and cruel war. So universal are its demands that there is scarcely a family which has not someone in the country's service. Every day, new lists of casualties come, more boys are killed, wound-ed, and maimed, and more hearts are broken. As the days go on, these sorrows will increase. Every week, for how long a time nobody knows, will bring more widows, more or-phans, more bereaved mothers and fathers, and sad sweethearts. This is the awful penalty of war. It always has been and it always will be. If a great grief comes to your home, you will need help. Nothing is more precious than one's own flesh and blood, and the loss of a manly son, a devoted husband, or father, or a life mate-to-be is not easily requited. Kinspeople, good friends, and neighbors may come to bring you sympathy, love, and kind-ness. This will help, but it will not be enough. You will tell yourself that he died in a great cause? in the service of his country. You will convince yourself that it was a noble sacrifice. You will be proud of him, but your heart will still ache and you will have an irrepressible long-ing once more to see his face, to hear his voice, and have his arms around you and feel again the warmth and tenderness of his lov-ing embrace. Surely you will need help. T KNOW of one source only from which that help may be secured. It is from this selfsame Jesus who gave His life for others and, on the third day, took it up again. Even with His help you will still weep, but you will not weep in vain. If you will let Him, He will take away all bitterness from your loss. He will touch your broken heart and it will mend, not all at once, perhaps, but gradually and surely. If you will listen to the voice of His Spirit and His holy Word, He will convince you that your loved one is not lost but only separated from you for a time, and that you may confidently look forward to a happy companion-ship in the not-too-distant future where there will be no more war, no more cruelty, and no more sad part-ings from those we love. It is true that it is necessary that you make preparation for such a glad reunion, but you will know, if you listen to Him, what you are to do, and you will have the joyful as-surance that His promises do not fail. This is the comfort and the hope that all of us so sorely need in the days of trial here and ahead. This is the comfort which the One who knew sorrow better than any other left with His disciples to heal their grieving hearts and the broken hearts of all who should come after them. Thank the Lord that comfort is free? free to everyone who will seek it. Rich or poor, the powerful or humble of the earth? all need it when sorrow comes and all may re- it, if they will open their hearts to the divine Spirit that emanates from Him who was the first fruit of the resurrection.? ?Wist Ye Not That I Must Be About My Father?s Business?? President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. V?THE FIRST DAY OF THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD THE dawn of the next morning after the eating of the Paschal lamb would usher in at the Temple the ceremonies incident to the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Just before the break of day the priests would assemble in the Hall of Polished Stones and begin to draw lots for the ceremonies of the day." The priests of the first lot would finish their duties. The second lot would then be drawn, whereupon a priest would ascend a "pinnacle" of the Temple to catch the first light of the morning. This lookout might have been from some point atop the southern enclosure, the Royal Porch, which overlooked the Valley of the Kedron whose floor was some 450 feet below the lofty pinnacle. Some? fix the top of this Porch as the "pinnacle" from which Satan bade the Savior cast himself down "for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." The priest observer sent to the pinnacle would, at the first sign of the morning light, announce, "The morning shineth already." Those below would then ask, "Is the sky lit up as far as Hebron?"?a city and mountain some twenty miles southward from Jerusalem. When the watcher announced the sky was so lit, the morning sacrifice was brought from Beth-Moked and prepared for the morning ceremony. It was at Hebron that Abraham's wife, Sarah, was buried in the cave of Machpelah;" David reigned over Israel from Hebron before he took Jerusalem; and here Absalom set himself up as king, having rebelled against his father." As already stated," the morning and evening sacrifices were essentially the same, and as the latter has been already described, it is unnecessary to repeat that description here in detail. Public Sacrifices Following the morning sacrifice, there were on this first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread several public sacrifices, all burnt offerings, in which only the priest officiated. The ceremonies incident to burnt offerings have been already described in connection with Joseph's sacrifice of the ram on the previous 193/ The Temple, p. 130, ff. 194/ The Temple, p. 21. 195/ Matt. 4:1-11; Mark 1:12- 13; Luke 4:1-13. 196/Gen. 23:19.

The ephod was of linen wrought in gold and purple secured on each shoulder by an onyx stone engraved with the names of six of the tribes of Israel. The breastplate of judgment, a piece of cloth eleven inches square, had four rows of precious stones with the name of one of the twelve tribes on each stone. In this breastplate was the Urim and Thummim. The mitre, of linen, had on the front a gold plate with the inscription, "Holiness to the Lord." day, Nisan 14th. The public sacrifices offered at this time were specified as follows: But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a bumt offering unto the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish: And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram; A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs; And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you." Attention may be called to certain differences between the burnt offering already described and the sin offering. People, Sin Offerings It may be first said that sin offerings were made for sins "through ignorance" or "involuntary sins" not for those which were deliberate or premeditated, that is, that were done "presumptuously."' For these latter, no atonement seems to have been provided, and the doer thereof was to be "cut off from among his and must await the judgment of God." Furthermore, as Edersheim says: But as without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin, every service and every worshiper had, so to speak, to be purified by blood, and the mediatorial agency of the priesthood called in to bring near unto God, and to convey the assurance of acceptance." 200/ See January Magazine, p. 9 ff. 201/ Numb. 28:19-22. 202/ Von Orelli in Schaff Herzog Religious Encyclopedia, sub voce "Sacrifice". 203/ Numb. 15:30. 204/ ibid. 15:30-31. 205/ The Temple, p. 101. 9:22. 206/ The Temple, p. 82; Lev. 17:10 ff.; Heb. 200 Von Orelli tells us: The actual slaughtering of the victim was merely to obtain the blood, not to inflict upon the victim the penalty merited by the sinner, the essential basis of the act being the forfeiture of an animal instead of a human life to the Deity. In the sin offering, moreover, the blood is not merely important, as in the burnt offering and the communal meal, but the one essential; and the sin offerings are, accordingly, invariably bloody, except in the case of the very poor.""" The sin offering being, on this occasion, a public one, the goat offered must be a male. "Outer" and "Inner" Offerings The strictness of the life to be led by the Jews is shown by the fact that the Rabbis specified some 369 "sins through ignorance" for which sacrifices must be made." In implementing the foregoing principles covering the importance and significance of the blood of the sacrifice, sin offerings were classed as "outer" and "inner." The "outer" offering seems to have been offered for the individual only, in which case the blood was "jerked or dropped," or "smeared" on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, first on the southeast horn, then on the northeast, then on the northwest, and lastly on the southwest, and what was left of the blood was poured out at the base of the altar where it drained off through conduits to the Valley of the Kedron. The "inner" sin offering was made (inter alia) for the entire people, and here the blood was used as follows. 207/ Von Orelli, op. Cit. 208/ The Temple, 104; Von Orelli, op. Cit. The officiating priest stood in the Holy Place, between the golden altar of incense and the candlestick, and either seven times sprinkled the blood towards the veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies, or seven times sprinkled the blood on the veil, following which he "touched" or "smeared" with the blood the horns of the golden altar of incense, the blood remaining was poured out at the foot of the altar of burnt offering." Before the ram was killed there was to be an imposition of hands by the officiating priest, after the manner already described for the burnt offering offered by Joseph. Parts Burned According to the direct commandments of the Lord," all the fat of certain sin offerings, "the fat that covers and is upon the inwards, the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, and the caul above the liver," were to be burned on the altar of burnt offering, while "the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung" were to be burned outside the city. In some cases, however, the sin offering might be eaten by the priests. We may feel that on this, the most important day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, as distinguished from the Passover, the faithful Joseph, again with the youth Jesus with him, would be at the Temple to observe the public sacrifices. Indeed, it would be the obligation of Jesus, now a "son of the law," to attend the Feast. 102. 209/ Ex. 29:12; Lev. 6; The Temple, 210/ Lev. 4:8 ff. 211/ Lev. 6:25-26. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS We may think that Jesus would be interested particularly in the offering of the sin sacrifice which, as we have seen, differed in some particulars from the ordinary burnt offering which he had seen on the previous day, and, furthermore, because of the "atonement" purpose of the sacrifice. Offering a Peace Offering Moreover, unless Joseph had offered the "Chagigah" on the day before (14th Nisan) Jesus would not have seen the making of a peace offering, including the "waving" and the "heaving" ceremonies. So we may assume that Jesus, having witnessed the sin offering, would be eagerly awaiting the ceremony of the peace offerings which Joseph had come prepared to make. One cannot forego again wondering what might have passed through the mind of the youth Jesus. Did He know that this day was the pre-anniversary of the day, some twenty-one years thence, when He should be again in these precincts, hurried and harried from Annas to Caiaphas, then to the illegal gathering of elders, to the Sanhedrin, to Pilate, to Herod, and back to Pilate, and then to Calvary and crucifixion; did He now know the scorn, the envy, the malice, the murderous hate that drove forward the High Priest, the chief priests, the elders, and all the Council, and indeed the whole maddened multitude in their demand for His crucifixion; did He see Pilate wash his hands before the seething, cursing mass, and hear Pilate say: "I am innocent of the blood of this just person," and hear the people shout 201 in reply: "His blood be on us, and on our children';" did He now sense the agony of spirit in the Garden, and of the body on the cross? did He know and see all this which twenty-one years thence was to happen on this very day and in these very purlieus? Did His own mission, His own destiny, His own sacrifice, His own atonement rise before Him as a vision of Himself, the Son of God? Private Sacrifices But returning to the Temple: following the making of the public offerings just described, the private individuals brought their offerings. These were of three kind': First, a burnt offering of small value (apparently effort was made to keep these offerings from being unduly burdensome on the poor); next the "Chagigah" offering for the 15th of Nisan, also of relatively small value; and lastly, what were called "sacrifices of joyousness." This last and the "Chagigah" were "peace offerings," and were also burnt offerings. They were made under the command: "Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee." It would appear that the sacrifices were offered under the general plan already given for burnt offerings, that is, there was first the imposition of hands by the offerer, who would slay it as in the normal burnt offering, and the priests would sprinkle the blood in the same way. Then the same parts that were burned on the altar of burnt offering in the sin offering, would be burned on the 212/ See N. 6, supra. 213/ Matt. 27:24-25. 214/ Deut. 16:17. 202 Drawing by Evan Jensen HOLY OF HOLIES HOLY PLACE (1) The Ark of the Covenant; Dotted line, the veil; (2) The Altar of Incense; (3) The Table of Shewbread; (4) The Golden Candlestick. The Ark of the Covenant?The Ark of the Covenant was an oblong chest made of shittim-wood, and covered within and without with the purest gold, with an ornamental rim or border on the top. Its breadth was more than thirty inches, the same in depth, and three feet and a half in length. On each side were two gold rings for the gold-covered staves by which it was removed, and which were not withdrawn from their places. They were drawn out so far as to touch the veil which separated the apartments. 'The lid of the Ark was of purest gold: above it were two figures of cherubim, made of solid gold, so placed that their faces turned towards each other, and were inclined toward the Ark. Between these cherubim rested the Shechinah, or the manifestation of the presence of God; its appearance was that of a luminous cloud. There was in the Ark the two tables of stone, called "The Testimony" on which the ten commandments were graven. Before the Ark was placed a pot of manna and Aaron's rod that budded. Atop the lid of the Ark was the so-called "'mercy seat" or "'propitiatory." The Ark disappeared with the Babylonish captivity. A Jewish tradition says it is "buried and concealed underneath the wood-court at the northeastern angle of the 'Court of Women'" (Temple p. 37). There was no Ark in the second Temple (Zerubbabel's) nor in Herod's Temple, but instead "The stone of foundation stood where the Ark used to be" (Davies in 4 Hastings Dictionary of the Bible, sub voce "Temple," p. 711). "Once a year on the Day of Atonement the High Priest alone entered the Holy of Holies to bring the blood of the sin-offerings into contact with the propitiatory" (Kennedy-in 4 Hastings Dictionary of the Bible, sub voce ""Tabernacle," p. 661). For the detail of the ceremony, see Hastings Bible Dictionary sub voce "Atonement." The Table of Shewbread?It was a table of shittim-wood, about three feet and a half in length, twenty inches broad, and about thirty inches in height, covered with plates of gold, and ornamented with a border of wrought gold. The frame of the table had a cornice or border round about it, about four inches in width, called its crown; and a similar border was underneath the top. There were also gold rings fastened to the legs, for the insertion of the staves to carry it. Twelve loaves of unleavened bread were continually on this table, each containing about ten pints of flour. They were placed in two piles, (or, as some say, in rows) and on top of each pile was a small quantity of frankincense and salt. These loaves were changed every week, when the frankincense was burned MY FATHER'S BUSINESS as an oblation. The name given to them in the original means "bread of the face,"* because it was Placed before the presence of Jehovah. Wine was also Placed upon this table in small bowls, or cups, called vials, which was weekly "poured out before the Lord." The Golden Candlestick?The large lamp-holder was made of pure gold, the main stem, according to the Jewish writers, being five feet high. Its weight was Josephus asserts, it was hollow within, and must therefore have been of considerable It had six branches, parallel with each other: at the end of each branch, and at the top of the main stem, was a lamp. Were ornamented with a bowl, knop, and flowers of All the seven lights were kept burn. Ing in the night; but it is said only three were used in the daytime. The lamps were supplied with the purest olive-oil; Procured, not by the common method of Pressure, but by bruising or beating the Olives, while yet somewhat green, in a mortar. Connected with this lamp-stand were tongs and snuffdishes: the former were Probably in the form of Scissors, to clip off the snuff and remove it into the dish, The candle.. ALTAR OF INCENSE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK Stick was carried off by the Romans under Titus in A. D. 70 at the destruction of Jerusalem, The Altar of Incense?This altar was made of shittim-wood, twenty-one inches in length, the same in breadth, and three feet and a half in height, ornamental border of gold, and four small There were at the sides rings for the staves, by which it was mary for the worshipers who were Standing without to offer their Players in silence. The Ptiest was strictly enjoined not to offer "strange incense," that is, any other than the sacred composition, upon the golden altar. The pictures and most of the descriptions are taken from The New Biblical Atlas and Scripture Gazeteer, 1855. 204 altar in this offering.215 These, with the blood, were considered as Jehovah's portion.216 "Wave" and "Heave" Offerings However, the carcass of the offerings was disposed of as were other "wave" and "heave" offerings." These offerings are described by Zenos as follows: The term "wave offering" and "heave " are applied to the priests' portion, and denote a peculiar ceremony consisting in the holding of the right shoulder of the victim horizontally and moving it forward toward the altar and backward away from the altar, in order to signify that the part was Jehovah's, but was given back to the priests by Him. Similarly, the term "heave offering" signifies the moving of the breast of the animal upward and then downward, in token of presenting it to God as His, and receiving it again as a gift from Him." That part of the carcass, not burned nor heaved not waved belonged to the offerer and was to be eaten with joyousness within two days and one night from the time of the sacrifice; all not So consumed was to be burned. Edersheim comments: "In peace-offerings the sacrificial meal was the point of main importance," for "this was, indeed, a season of happy fellowship with the Covenant God, in which He condescended to become Israel's Guest at the sacrificial meal, even as He was always their Host." So, as on the previous day, Joseph and Jesus having now finished their offerings, would again proceed to their lodgings, carrying with them their portions of the peace-offerings, both of the "Chagigah" and of the "offering of joyousness. ? 215/ Lev. 3:1 ff. 216/ Zenos, sub voce "Sacrifice". Op. Cit. 219/ The Temple, p. 106. 220/ Edersheim I, p. 246. We seem to have no record of any ritual to be followed at this meal, but as Edersheim states, it must be one of happy fellowship. The offering of these sacrifices On the second day of the whole feast, though on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, completed the attendance which was required of worshipers at the Temple. They might, if they wished, return to their homes." One other public ceremony of this first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread should be described?that, of the gathering of the "first sheaf."? Until this was gathered it was not lawful either to sell or to eat the crop of fresh barley now ripening in the fields. On the preceding day?Nisan 14th, the day of the Passover?representatives of the Sanhedrin had gone into the barley fields (the sheaf must not be taken from gardens) and had tied into bundles the standing grain that was to be cut as the "first sheaf." The grain to be cut must be grown in ground that was not manured, nor watered artificially; it must have been plowed in the preceding autumn and planted seventy days before the Passover. (On the 15th of Nisan?the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread?as twilight came on, three priests, usually accompanied by a noisy, joyous crowd, would leave the Temple precincts, cross the Kedron, into the fields of barley and the 217/ Lev. 7:29 ff. 218/ Zenos, 221/ Lev. 23:10 &. 222/ Lev. 23:14; The Temple, p. 2225 Josephus Antiq. III, 10:5-6. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS bundles that had been tied the previous evening. Apparently the fields in the Ashes-valley across the Kedron were chosen for this purpose. Each priest had a sickle, and a basket. As soon as the sun went down (which by Jewish reckoning made it Nisan 16th), the priests asked five questions, repeating each three times: "Has the sun gone down?"; "With this sickle?"; "Into this basket?"; "On the Sabbath (or first Passover day)?"; "Shall I reap?" The multitude answering these questions in the affirmative each time, the priests cut the grain tied into bundles on the previous day, to the amount of a little over three-quarters of a bushel (three pecks three pints). Josephus describes the ceremony as follows: But on the second day of unleavened bread, which is the sixteenth day of the month, they first partake of the fruits of the earth, for before that day they do not touch them. And while they suppose it proper to honor God from whom they obtain a plentiful provision, in the first place they offer the first-fruits of their barley, and that in the manner following: they take an handful of the ears, and dry them, then beat them small, and purge the barley from the bran; they then bring one-tenth deal to the altar, to God; and casting one handful of it upon the fire, they leave the rest for the use of the priest. And after this it is that they may publicly or privately reap their harvest. They also at this participation of the first-fruits of the earth, sacrifice a lamb, as a burnt offering to God." To these details, Edersheim adds others as follows: that the grain was threshed with canes or stalks in the Court of the Temple; that after threshing, the grain was "parched" 205 in a pan perforated with holes so that every grain was touched by the fire; that then the grain was exposed to the breeze; that the grain was ground in a mill; that according to some authorities, the flour was passed through thirteen sieves, each finer than the other, while another authority says it was sieved until no part of it remained on the hands of the tester as he thrust his hands into the flour; that while as stated three pecks three pints (one ephah, ten omers, or three seahs) were harvested and threshed, only one omer (five and one-tenth pints) was offered in the Temple, and the balance could "be redeemed and used for any purpose." The omer to be used in the Temple was mixed with a "log" of oil (nearly three-fourths of a pint), to which was added a handful of frankincense, then from this mixture, after it was waved before the Lord, a handful was burned on the altar and the balance belonged to the priest. The Evening of the Sacrifice It is an inescapable reflection? that on the evening of the crucifixion?twenty-one years from this night?two groups on very different errands, would be engaged in ritual ceremonies: the one, the priests, with their noisy crowd, would be surging across the Kedron to Ashesvalley to reap the "first sheaf"; the other, the small grief-stunned group carrying the lifeless mortal body of Christ to the garden-tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. For Joseph and Nicodemus, both Sanhedrists, both secret disciples of the living Christ, but 223/ Antiq. III, 10:5. 224/ The Temple, p. 223 ff. 225/ The Temple, p. 221; Edersheim II, p. 615, ff.; Geikie, II, p. 575. 206 without courage to follow Him in life, now in death touched by a deeper faith, bravely, openly, lovingly, reverently would be carrying the mortal body of the Son of God to His burial. And after the sun had gone and the twilight deepened, when the "first sheaf" had been garnered and the rock had been rolled up to close the mouth of the tomb, each group would wend its way homeward?the priests with their shouting, laughing, merrymaking multitude, bearing torches to light their way, back across the Kedron to the Temple Courts to thresh, grind, mix, and offer the offering of the first fruits of the harvest; Joseph and Nicodemus, and the women who had gone with them, without torch, slowly stumbling over the uneven stones, weeping, their hearts in the tomb they had left, back from the garden into the narrow, crooked streets of Jerusalem to their sorrow-burdened homes, never again to be gladdened by His presence. For these, the sinking of the sun in the west had seemed to carry along into 226/ Edersheim II, p. 619. the darkness the inner light by which they had been guiding their lives. As Eidersheim says: The contrast is as sad as it is suggestive. And yet, not in the Temple, nor by the priest, but in the silence of that garden-tomb, was the first Omer of the new Paschal flour to be waved before the Lord." Still again we must wonder whether as the shadows lengthened and the sun sank in the west, while the full moon rose from over the Jordan, as Joseph and Jesus again plodded, after another long day, to their lodgings in the city, in Bethany, or it may be in Bethlehem, did the Youth see and know, on this pre-anniversary of a day yet to come, the grief He was to suffer, the spiritual and physical agony He was to endure, the death that was to come to Him, as He was sacrificed as the Lamb of God to atone for the transgression of Adam, for by the fall and through the atonement man was to meet his destiny?
