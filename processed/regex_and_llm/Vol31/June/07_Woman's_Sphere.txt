Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon IF one could measure love, one would doubtless find registered high on the scale, the love inspired by Sister May Booth Talmage, who died April 6, at the age of seventy-five. Her spirit was rooted and nurtured in kindliness. Countless are the neighbors, friends, relations, home helpers, missionary sons, and Church members for whom she did thoughtful and helpful deeds. Although in poor health, she had been assisting her husband's brother, Albert Talmage, to publish a magazine for the blind. She was the widow of Dr. James E. Talmage, noted apostle, writer, orator, and intellectual leader in the Church. They had eight children. While her husband was presiding for three years over the European Mission, she freely used her unusual talents and originality in her part of the work. Many people of all ages, both there and in America, will feel that they have lost a close personal friend. A member of the General Board of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association for thirty-eight years, Sister Talmage edited the Young Woman's Journal for two years. She sought truth always, and loved and strove for accuracy. Possessing both wit and wisdom, she added brightness as well as inspiration to any gathering. She lived well-nigh faultlessly the precepts of the Gospel, and in very deed merited the title Latter-day Saint. MOTHERING the world more extensively than ever before, the American Red Cross has a wonderful record of accomplishments for the year ending March 1, 1944. In our fifty-six war centers are 350 overseas clubs which provide recreation—furnishing pianos, radios, books, stationery, food, etc., to our forces. Camp and hospital workers have aided 3,800,000 persons. Home Service workers have helped 2,500,000 people with such problems as financial assistance to soldiers' families, obtaining emergency leaves of absence, and locating negligent soldiers for their families. The Red Cross has collected 2,500,000 pints of blood for plasma, and has recruited 50,000 nurses and trained 65,000 nurses' aids. It has helped 119,000 sufferers from disaster in our own country. With the assistance of a great army of volunteers, it has prepared the astounding number of 925,000,000 _ surgical dressings, has made 12,000,000 garments for war relief, and has packed 5,300,000 prisoner-of-war kits. These are known to reach the prisoners in all countries, with the possible exception of some in Japan. ATTENDING Wellesley College are Chandralekha and Nyantara Pandit, nieces of the famous Nehru, and daughters of the Ranjit Pandits. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, deeply interested in the future of India's women, is responsible for the girls attending Wellesley. Page 311
