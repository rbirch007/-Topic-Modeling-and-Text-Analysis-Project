The Republic of Czechoslovakia Dr. Leland Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah F all the autonomous states which the buffeting waves of nationalism created from the wreckage of the old non-national Hapsburg Empire, the strongest and best organized was Czechoslovakia, a republic consisting of the five districts of Bohemia, Moravia, Austrian Silesia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, and comprising an aggregate area ) 54,270 square miles. The first three of these districts, the Slavic inhabitants of which are called Czechs, belonged to Austria, the latter two, inhabited largely by Slovaks and Ruthenians, belonged to Hungary. The dramatic winning of Czechoslovakian independence was largely the work of three great patriots: Thomas Garrigue Mazaryk and Edward Benes, professors, and the brilliant military strategist, Milan Stefanik, commander of the Czechoslovakian legions in France. Conspicuous as a Slovak nationalist, a philosophical liberal and an ardent anti-Hapsburg, Mazaryk was forced to flee his homeland when the great World Wat began in 1914. He spent the next four years disseminating propaganda and organizing opinion in the Allied states of Europe and America. In Russia, he helped organize Czechoslovakian legions; in the United States, he raised funds; in France, he set up propaganda headquarters, everywhere he labored for the cause of Czechoslovakian independence. Benes, a former student of Mazaryk Page 302 and a prolific writer on political, social, and economic subjects, hated the Hapsburg regime just as intense For some time he was professor of philosophy and sociology at the Polytechnic School at Prague. When the wart broke out (1914), he repaired to Paris where, for the ensuing four years, his diplomatic ability and his resourcefulness were great assets in securing hearings for the cause and in keeping UP communications with the revolutionary leaders left behind in Austria-Hungary Says the historian Langsam: All sorts of clever ruses and subterfuges had to be devised in order to maintain communication between the leaders in Paris and those at home. 'The story of these ruses ls fascinating and thrilling, full of arrests and hair-raising escapes, of secret meetings and code telegrams, falsified passports and faked certificates, microscopic messages carried in hollow teeth and pipe stems, and important state secrets betrayed by the Czech servants of unsuspecting Austrian officials. In addition to all this, money had to be raised, capable journalists had to be found, scores of articles, pamphlets and manifestos had to be got up, imprisoned leaders had to be replaced, 'and recognition had to be secured for the National Council of Czechoslovakia (sitting in Paris) as official spokesmen for the Czechoslovak people. (The World Since 1914 P- 447) But the patriots were successful. In the fall of 1918, when Allied victory seemed assured, and after the Allies had listed as one of their wat aims the establishment of an THE REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA 303 GERMANY Warsaw POLAND ROMANIA —Drawing by Evan Jensen CZECHOSLOVAKIA autonomous Czechoslovakian state, Mazaryk, Benes, and Stefanik felt the time ripe to issue a declaration of independence. This was done on October 18. Ten days later, the Czech National Council in Prague, led by Kramars, took over the reins of administration from the imperial officers, in practically what amounted to a bloodless revolution. On October 29, a Slovak National Council voted union with the Czechs, and on November 14, a Provisional National Assembly proclaimed the republic. Fittingly enough, Mazaryk was elected president, Kramars became prime minister, Benes was appointed foreign minister, and Stefanik was chosen minister of war. Benes and Kramars repaired to Paris to represent the newly created state at the Peace Conference. On February 29, 1920, the Provisional Assembly adopted a constitution, modelled after those of the United States and France. The document provided for a democratic, parliamentary regime with a definite separation of powers. The Chamber of Deputies was to consist of 300 members who must be at least thirty years of age and who were elected for six years by the compulsory vote of all men and women over twenty-one; and the Senate, of 150 members, who must be at least forty-five years of age, and elected for a period of eight years by all voters over twenty-six. The ministry was made directly responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. The two houses were to meet in March and October of each year. The president, who was empowered to exercise a suspensive veto, was to be thirty-five years of age or over, and was to be elected for seven years by the two houses meeting together as the 304 National Assembly. It was provided that no one except the first president (Mazaryk) could serve two consecutive terms, although a second re-election after a lapse of a single term was made permissible. There was to be no vice-president. ERHAPS the most pressing domestic problem facing the new state was that of land reform. Under Hapsburg rule, the tendency in all the provinces had been to accumulate land allotments in a few, large holdings. Thus, at one time, thirty-three individuals held one-sixth of all the land in Bohemia, whereas 373,000 peasants owned less than one per cent. In 1918, two per cent of the landowners in Bohemia owned more than twenty-five per cent of the land in that district, while in Moravia nearly one-third of the land was controlled by less than one per cent of the owners, and in Slovakia half the land was in possession of about one thousand persons. One-half of all the farms in Bohemia and Moravia consisted of seven and one-half acres or less. To remedy this situation, the Provisional Assembly, in 1910, passed a series of laws which provided for the expropriation of all estates exceeding in size 375 acres of arable land or 625 acres of mixed arable and non-arable land, with no compensation whatsoever for lands thus expropriated from the Crown or from members of the Hapsburg family. The land thus acquired was to be sold by the state at generous rates and on easy terms to small farmers, ex-service men, and to any landless person who desired to till the soil. Under no circumstances were more than thirty-seven and one-half acres to be assigned to any one individual. Under the operation of this program, by 1926, more than half a million citizens had become "middle class farmers," direct owners of sufficient land to provide an adequate livelihood. This expropriation policy precipitated a quarrel between the Czechish government and the Roman Catholic Church, because much of the land thus confiscated had been Catholic Church property. The quarrel was further intensified because of the successful efforts of the state to abolish compulsory religious instruction in the schools. The government insisted further that the papacy redraw the diocesan boundaries so as to make them conform to the frontiers of the state, that Czechs be appointed to the higher church offices, and that the native tongue be substituted for German or Hungarian wherever the parishes were predominantly Slavic. Some of the radicals went so far as to successfully demand the establishment of a Czechoslovak National Church which proclaimed its independency from the papacy and abolished the requirement of celibacy for the clergy. This Church, however, recruited almost no Slovak adherents and fewer than a million Czech members. The quarrel between the government and the papacy was ended in January 1928, by the signing of a compromise agreement. The diocesan boundaries were to be rearranged so as to coincide with the republic's borders; the state was to continue paying the salaries of the clergy, but was to have a voice in the nomination of bishops, all of whom were to be Czech citizens; all church officials were to be THE REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA required to take an oath of allegiance to the state; and the Czechish tongue was prescribed for certain SEIVICES. From an economic point of view, the newly created Czechoslovakian Republic is one of the most fortunate states in Europe. A splendid system of railroad lines and terminals as well as approximately eighty per cent of the total industries of the defunct Dual Monarchy were acquired by the new state. Though comprising only one-fifth of the area of the old Austria-Hungary, and including only one-fourth of her population (14,000,000), Czecho- - Slovakia possesses four-fifths of the ex-monarchy's manufacturing equipment, including the famous Bohemian glass and pottery works and textile industries, three-fifths of its breweries, nine-tenths of its soft coal, and three-fifths of its iron ore. Agriculturally, | Czechoslovakia is virtually self-sufficient. Bohemia, under the old regime, produced ninety per cent of the empire's sugar beets, eighty per cent of the hops, and seventy-five per cent of the fruit. Forty-two per cent of the land in the republic is arable. Slovakia produces considerable quantities of flax, maize, wine, tobacco, silver, copper, lead, and graphite. Czechoslovakian munition factories are among the most extensive and efficient in the world. More than 800 miles of navigable riverways are found within the borders of the republic. Furthermore, before the German conquest (1939), landlocked Czechoslovakia had secured access to the sea through German territory at Hamburg and Stettin, and through Italian territory at Trieste. These important guaran- 305 tees were incorporated in the postwar treaties of Versailles and Saint Germain. The enormous industrial output of the country has prompted the government to seek foreign markets through cordial trade and business relationships with the outside world. Her best customers, before the recent conquest, were Germany, Austria, Great Britain, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and the United States. With each of these countries and with many others, Czechoslovakia early negotiated favorable trade and commercial treaties. Because of its peculiar geographical location, the question of national security in Czechoslovakia is crucial. The republic is about 600 miles long and varies in width from fifty to 125 miles, with an aggregate area of 54,270 square miles. Landlocked, the country, as already noted, depends upon the postwar peace treaties for its assured access to the sea. Furthermore, the republic is completely surrounded by five countries —Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Austria—the first three consistently hostile to the continued existence of the state; for about half the length of her boundary, the republic is surrounded by a German pincers formed by the southern German and the northern Austrian boundaries. Because of this fact, the Czechoslovakians have vigorously but unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the consummation of the much-feared Austrian — German Anschluss. Then, too, except for the region of the Carpathians and the Erzeburge, Czechoslovakian frontiers offer little natural protection. Because of these unusual topographical features and because of the 306 circumstances which led to the very inception of the state, the government of Czechoslovakia has diligently pursued a policy of international Policy, broken down objectives included: (1) hearty support of the League of Nations as the Protector of small states and the mainstay of peace and Stability on the continent; (2) friendly relations with Russia because of the ties of Slavism and the desire for trade; (3) consistent and uninterrupted Support of the postwar peace treaties; (4) amicable relations with France; and tion of the Little Entente ( 1921), and Czechoslovakia negotiated a treaty of friendship, in which each promised to remain neutral in case the other was third party, to submit all future disputes to arbitration, and to co-operate in Preventing the d regime. Austria, however, has steadfastly refused to enter the Little Entente coalition. Fora while during the late Twenties, bonds of the Little Entente might be loosed because of the drifting of Rumania to. Ward Italy in the evolving European diplomatic alignment. However, the revival of the Anschluss agitation in Germany and Austria after 1926; the conclusion of a treaty of friendship between Italy and Hungary, the latter, Czechoslovakia's most quarrelsome neighbor: the revival of Magyar irredentist agitation which threatened, if successful, to undo the Treaty of Trianon and the very foundation of the coalition of States; and the serious consideration, after 1930, of a Balkan federation to improve economic conditions, resuscitated and gave new life to the Little Entente relationships, MOST difficult of all problems of Czechoslovakia, and one which threatens to become the most disturbing after the Present world crisis, is the problem of racial minorities, In fact, it was this crucial problem focusing in German-inhabited Sudetenland, which led directly to the shameful Munich Pact, a crisis which in turn Precipitated the Hitleristic Conquest and the end of Czechoslovakian independence. The republic before the Conquest (1939) had over 14,000,000 inhabitants, of whom two-thirds were Czechs or Slovaks, The Remaining third was made up of approximately 3,300,000 Germans, 760,000 Magyars, 480,000 Ruthenians, Jews. Been required to sign a minority treaty for the protection of these non-national subjects, and the same guarantee was incorporated in the constitution of 1920. In accord with these Promises, special schools were at once provided for the minorities, the use of a minority language authorized in business transactions where one-fifth of the Population used that tongue, and a voice in the government guaranteed to all groups. The latter was assured through the adoption of Proportional representation in parliament. Despite these guarantees, considerable difficulty has been experienced with minority groups. The millions of Germans of Bohemia and Mo. Tavia, powerful middle-class men of THE REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA prewar days, and intensely disliked by the Czechs, formed a strong and dangerous opposition unit. Until 1926, these groups refused to cooperate and boycotted parliamentary elections. Since 1926, however, largely because of President Mazaryk's diplomacy and influence, a better spirit prevailed for awhile. In that year, two Germans were appointed to cabinet positions in the government and Germans participated for the first time in the general elections. However, extreme nationalists from both German and Czech factions succeeded in keeping alive the flames of animosity existing between the two peoples, and thereby prepared the way for Goebbel's skillful program of Nazi propaganda. Relations with the Carpathio-Russians have been even more strained. Ruthenia was assigned to Czechoslovakia by the Peace Conference in order to provide a new state with a natural boundary in the Carpathian Mountains and also to bring it into direct contact with Rumania, thus forming a solid ring about Hungary. Now, while the Czechs by treaty provisions are bound to grant the Ruthenians autonomy, they have hesitated to do so and instead have appointed Czechs to important offices. The government justified its policy on the ground that the Ruthenians constitute a relatively backward and largely illiterate group, which, if left to themselves, would fall under the control of the better-educated Magyars and Jews within the province. The situation was alleviated somewhat when, in 1928, laws were passed which reorganized the entire provincial administration and granted 307 Ruthenia practically complete local autonomy. The population question is further complicated by the antagonism of the Czechs and Slovaks themselves. The Czechs, who outnumber the Slovaks almost two to one, are somewhat more westernized than their compatriots and tend to dominate the governmental partnership. They have a higher percentage of literacy than the Slovaks and are much more interested in commerce and industry than in agriculture. Disagreements and quarrels, sometimes to the accompaniment of bloodshed, soon arose. The Slovaks accused the Czechs of monopolizing the desirable offices and of violating, at least in spirit, the "Pittsburgh Pact" of 1918, wherein Mazaryk, in order to get the support of the American Slovaks for his Czech-Slovak unification project, was said to have given a promise of Slovak autonomy. Since 1926, thanks again to the diplomatic efforts of President Mazaryk, the tension between the two peoples became very much alleviated. "THE consummation of Anschluss (the annexation of Austria to the Reich) in April 1938, was the signal for more bellicose unrest among the Czechoslovaks. Clearly the aim of Hitler was the annexation of the republic. War was narrowly averted in the month of May 1938. A frontier altercation resulted in the death of two Germans. Hitler promptly cut off negotiations with the Czechs and rushed troops to the border. Czechoslovakia as promptly mobilized and hastened 400,000 troops to her frontiers. France and Russia, as allies of the Little Entente 308 affirmed their support, and when Britain strongly endorsed the Czech position, Hitler withdrew his troops. Nevertheless, despite the untoward turn of this crisis, the Fuehrer did not give up his intentions of incorporating hapless Czechoslovakia within the German Reich,. In September 1938, there occurred renewed uprisings among the - Sudeten Germans. The British ambassador, Lord Runciman, declared later that these had been incited by Nazi agitators. President Benes at once declared martial law. Shortly afterwards, the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, announced his intention of flying by airplane to consult with Hitler. This was to be the first of three trips "to Canossa" which the Prime Minister of England was to take, "successful trips all of them in humiliating subservience to the will of the German dictator." The first flight was to Berchtesgaden, where he was told by Hitler that Germany insisted on the instant inclusion of the Sudeten Germans in the German Reich, even at the cost of a general war. This proposition was not only acceded to by Britain and France, but the two erstwhile friends of the hapless _republic agreed to even greater humiliation; namely, that the reduced republic should "renounce all the treaties of defense with other countries, suppress all anti-German agitation, and enter into close economic relations with the Reich." But even these humiliating concessions did not satiate the Nazi dictator. Continued restlessness by the Sudeten-German minority led to further negotiations and the final conference of interested parties at Munich, in September 1938. Czechoslovakia was an uninvited onlooker as the four statesmen— Chamberlain, Deladier, Mussolini, and Hitler, carved up the unhappy republic, according to the infamous Godesberg ultimatum.' Four zones were to be occupied by the Germans. A fifth was created in which there was supposed to be plebiscites. But the final result proved this stipulation to be a farce. The Germans took what they wanted, marched to within forty miles of Prague, and absorbed about 750,000 Czechs in the new Germany. As they did so, the Poles invaded Teschen, annexing about 80,000 Poles and 100,000 Czechs. Hungary then advanced from the south, crossed the Danube, and took Bratislava. But still the Nazis were not satisfied. Hitler had himself solemnly pledged to go no farther, but he had not the slightest intention of keeping his word. Having swallowed somewhat more than one-third of the area of Czechoslovakia, he was still greedy for more. The Germans, thereupon, demanded and obtained a corridor across what was left of the republic for a military highway; they demanded also and obtained the right to decide on the destinies of Slovakia and Ruthenia. When Hacha, last president of the republic, protested, he, like the Austrian Schuschnigg before him, was summoned before the presence of Hitler. Hacha's going, however, was a mere formality. Even before he reached Berlin, the German army started south and crossed the Czech border. Once at Berlin, the Czech President, berated and browbeaten by Hitler, signed away the independence of his country. THE REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA Simultaneously as he did so, the German army entered Prague. Thus perished the Republic of Czechoslovakia, victim of one of the most ruthless and brutal outrages in all history. Within a new Czechoslovakia, renewed consideration must be given to the vexed and complicated minority problem and even greater concessions must be made. It may be desirable to detach Sudetenland, inhabited almost exclusively by 309 Germans, from the new state. Other than this arrangement, it appears that the problem might be approached and appreciably solved: (1) by giving more autonomy than heretofore was realized to all minority groups; (2) by developing a more integrated nationalism through a well-planted system of education; and (3) by effecting a greater decentralization of public administration.
