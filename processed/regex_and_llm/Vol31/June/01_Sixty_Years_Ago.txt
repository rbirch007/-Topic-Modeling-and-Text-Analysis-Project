Sixty Years Ago 310 THEOFFERING Mabel Jones Gabbott God's world has much to offer To a heavy burdened heart; A canyon breeze to whisper Coolness, calming peace; a part Of yellow sunshine slanting Through new leaves, distilling green; A sparkling brook that chatters Of the wonders it has seen; The song of tall white aspens, Lifted like a hushed sweet prayer To cirrus clouds in filmy Tendrils, high in pale, blue air.

VOL. 31, NO. 6 JUNE 1944 [Editor’s Note: June 1 is the natal day of Brigham Young, and June 27, 1944 will mark the one hundredth anniversary of the martyrdom of Prophet Joseph Smith] ONE of the most interesting and dramatic events in our Church history was the occasion when the Prophet Joseph Smith and Brigham Young met for the first time. This meeting occurred at Kirtland, Ohio, in September 1832. The Prophet Joseph, was only twenty-six years old at the time, but he had already made a remarkable record. The Book of Mormon had been translated and printed; the Church had been organized and had acquired upwards of 2,000 members, a gathering place for the Saints had been designated in Jackson County, Missouri; missionaries were being sent to many of the states and Canada, and the Gospel was being preached with power and effectiveness to all who would hear.
Among the converts who had been baptized in the spring of that year, 1832, was a young man, thirty years of age, named Brigham Young. He had joined the Church in his home town, Mendon, New York, through the preaching of five elders who came to Mendon and vicinity from Columbia, Pennsylvania. He was a strong, vigorous young man—a carpenter and furniture maker by trade—who had established himself in his community as a reliable, hon-
est, diligent, and honorable citizen. He looked forward to a life of peace and happiness in his quiet countryside. Then came the story of the young Prophet, his visions, and the establishment of the Church. Brigham Young, according to his own words, "heard and believed." A new world was opened to him. He found out that there were other and greater trusts for him to do than to make furniture and till his little farm at Mendon. He could save his own soul; he could bring the light of knowledge and truth to those who dwelt in darkness.
A branch of the Church was established in Mendon, and among the members were Joseph Young, Brigham Young's brother, and Heber C. Kimball. In the month of September 1832, these three young men decided to make a journey to Kirtland, Ohio, and there meet and visit with the Prophet of their chosen religion. The distance was about two hundred and forty miles; they traveled with a team and wagon, and two weeks' time was consumed in making the journey. On their arrival, their first object was to find the Prophet. I shall let Brigham Young relate that part of the story in his own words: 292 We proceeded to Kirtland, and stopped at John P. Greene's who had just arrived there with his family. We rested a few minutes, took some refreshments and started to see the Prophet. We went to his father's house and learned that he was in the woods chopping. We immediately went to the woods, where we found the Prophet and two or three of his brothers, chopping and hauling wood. Here my joy was full at the privilege of shaking the hand of the Prophet of God, and I received the sure testimony, by the spirit of prophecy, that he was all that any man could believe him to be as a true Prophet. He was happy to see us and made us welcome. We soon returned to his house, he accompanying us.—Millennial Star, Vol. 25, p. 439. Brigham Young had traveled two hundred and forty miles to see the Prophet of his chosen religion, and he found him "chopping and hauling wood." But when Brigham took Joseph Smith by the hand, and looked into his eyes, the Spirit bore witness to him that this young man before him "was all that any man could believe him to be as a true Prophet." Brigham Young was satisfied. Then and there he pledged his abiding loyalty to his youthful leader—a loyalty which continued until the Prophet's death, and beyond. Other significant events happened on this memorable day. They are described by Brigham Young as follows: In the evening a few of the brethren came in and we conversed together upon the things of the Kingdom. He (Joseph) called upon me to pray; in my prayer | spoke in tongues. As soon as we arose from our knees the brethren flocked around him and asked his opinion concerning the gift of tongues that was upon me. He told them it was the pure Adamic language. Some said to him they expected he would condemn the gift Brother Brigham had, but he said, "No, it is of God, and the time will come when Brother Brigham Young will preside over this church." The latter part of this conversation was in my absence.—Millennial Star, Vol. 25, p. 439. It is apparent from the above that the Prophet Joseph understood and could foresee the mission which was to be performed by the stalwart young man whose acquaintance he had made this day. He urged Brigham to join the Saints in Kirtland as soon as it was convenient for him to do so, and to give his time and efforts to the cause in which they all were engaged. Brigham gave heed to this advice, and the following year sold his possessions in Mendon and moved to the gathering place. From that time on, the balance of his life was spent in assisting the Prophet, and "building up the Church and Kingdom of God" to the fullest extent of his time and talents. In 1835, the first Quorum of Twelve Apostles was organized and Brigham Young was selected as one of the number. Thus he came into prominence for the first time as an official of the Church, and his qualities of leadership were soon in evidence. He carried out every order given him by the Prophet, and worked at every task assigned to him without any thought of compensation. His whole thought was to sustain the Prophet in his great efforts to establish the Kingdom. The year 1837 was the time of the great apostasy in Kirtland. Many rebelled against the leadership of the Prophet. Several of the Twelve Apostles and the witnesses of the Book of Mormon held a meeting to JOSEPH SMITH AND BRIGHAM YOUNG depose Joseph from the presidency of the Church and install David Whitmer in his stead. Brigham Young attended this meeting and took a stand that thwarted their purpose. Here are his own words: I rose up and in a plain and forcible manner told them that Joseph was a Prophet, and I knew it, and that they might rail and slander him as much as they pleased, they could but destroy their own authority, cut the thread that bound them to the Prophet of God, and sink themselves to hell—Millennial Star, Vol. 25, p. 487. That was the kind of loyalty that Brigham Young gave to the Prophet in one of the most critical times in our Church history. There is every evidence that it was duly appreciated. During the winter of 1837-38, the Prophet, accompanied by Brigham Young and others, made the long journey from Kirtland to Missouri. But there they found troubles greater than those they had experienced in Kirtland; the Missouri mobs rose against them and it was not long before all the Latter-day Saints, numbering between 12,000 and 15,000, were being driven from that state. The Prophet was taken to Liberty Jail where he was kept for five months. Many of the prominent men of the Church renounced the leadership of the Prophet at this time, but again Brigham Young stood firm and used his energy and talents to restore order and find a haven of refuge for the scattered and persecuted people. THE mission to England, undertaken in the fall of 1839 by Brigham Young and the members 293 of the Twelve, is one of the most heroic episodes in our Church history. These men went in illness and in poverty, trusting in the providence of God to sustain them and take them to their field of labor. They arrived in England and began their efforts, which resulted in the greatest "harvest of souls" in the history of the European Mission. Two weeks after his arrival in England, Brigham Young pledged his loyalty to the Prophet in a letter addressed to "President Joseph Smith and Counselors" in Nauvoo: I believe that I am as willing to do the will of the Lord, and take counsel of my brethren, and be a servant of the Church as I ever was in my life. But I can tell you I would like to be with my old friends; I like new friends, but I cannot part with my old ones for them.... I request one favor from you, that is, a letter from you, that I may hear from my old friends. I trust that I will remain your friend through life and eternity. — Millennial Star, Vol. 25, p. 727. Brigham Young was destined to remain Joseph Smith's friend throughout "life and eternity." After a most successful mission in England, during which time the brethren baptized "between seven and eight thousand people," the apostles returned to their homes in Nauvoo in the summer of 1841. Nine days after Brigham Young's return, the Prophet called at his home, and while there dictated the following revelation: Dear and well-beloved brother, Brigham Young, verily thus saith the Lord unto you: My servant Brigham, it is no more required at your hand to leave your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me. I have seen your labor and toil in journeyings for my name, I therefore 294 command you to send my word abroad, and take special care of your family from this time, henceforth and forever. Amen. —Doc. & Cov., Sec. 126. The above makes plain the feelings which the Prophet himself held for his devoted follower and assured him of the approval of his Heavenly Father. From this time on, during the balance of the year 1841 and all of 1842, the Prophet and Brigham Young were almost in constant association. In November 1842, Brigham Young suffered a very severe illness. He remained in bed for several weeks. At one time it was thought that he was very near to death. He tells us that the Prophet Joseph sustained him during this illness: The Prophet Joseph and Elder Willard Richards visited and administered unto me; the Prophet prophesied that I should live and recover from my sickness. He sat by me for six hours and directed my attendants what to do for me.—Millennial Star, Vol. 26, p. 167. It was no small honor to Brigham Young to have the Prophet Joseph Smith sit by his bedside for six hours, during this desperate illness. There is evidence here that the Prophet was concerned about the life of his dear friend. On the 28th day of May, 1843, the Prophet Joseph made a significant entry in his History with reference to Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball. He paid them a wonderful tribute: Of the Twelve Apostles chosen in Kirtland, and ordained under the hands of Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and myself, there have been but two but what have lifted their heel against me— namely Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball—Documentary History of the Church, Vol. 5, p. 412. In the summer of 1843, Brigham Young went on a mission to the Eastern States. At Pittsburgh, he preached a sermon to the Saints who had assembled to hear him: Who is the author of this work and gathering? Joseph Smith, the Prophet, as an instrument in the hands of God, is the author of it. He is the greatest man on the earth. No other man at this age of the world, has power to assemble such a great people from all the nations of the earth, with all their varied dispositions, and so assimilate and cement them together that they become subject to rule and order. This the Prophet Joseph is doing.—Millennial Star, Vol. 26, p. 247. "He is the greatest man on earth." That, in brief, was Brigham Young's opinion of the man who stood at the head of the Church; the man whom the Lord had selected to found the Kingdom. It is an honor to Brigham Young that he was able to recognize and understand the importance of the Prophet's mission. The winter of 1843-44 was the last opportunity these two men had to enjoy each other's society. One learns by reading the history that they were in almost daily association. One of their projects at this time was to send a group of men to the Rocky Mountains "to select a location for the settlement of the Saints." On May 2ist, Brigham Young left Nauvoo and started on a mission to the Eastern States. He intended to be away only about three months. At Petersboro, New Hampshire, on July 16th, 1844, he received a letter which informed him that the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum JOSEPH SMITH AND BRIGHAM YOUNG had been killed by a mob in Carthage Jail, three weeks previously. This news came as a terrible shock to Brigham Young. He immediately made his way to Boston, where he met several of the apostles. Wilford Woodruff recorded the following in his diary under date of July 17th: Elder Brigham Young arrived in Boston this morning. I walked with him to 57 Temple Street, and called upon Sister Vose. Brother Young took the bed and gave vent to his feelings in tears.—Documentary History of the Church, Vol. 7, p. 195. The great, strong man Brigham Young, lying on the bed at the home of Sister Vose, weeping on account of the death of his dear friend, leader, and prophet, Joseph Smith— that is a picture long to be remembered. But he arose from that bed of tears with the great and unalterable determination to continue on with the work which the Prophet had restored to earth and founded, under divine direction. His task was clear to him. A few weeks later he said in a public sermon in Nauvoo: Brother Joseph, the Prophet, has laid the foundation for a great work, and we will build upon it;... There is an almighty foundation laid, and we can build a kingdom such as there never was in this world.... —Documentary History of the Church, Vol. 7, p. 234. All of Brigham Young's subsequent life was spent in the magnificent task of "building up the Kingdom," however, to his dying day, he missed the counsel and leadership of his friend, the Prophet Joseph Smith. Four days after the arrival of the first pioneers in Salt Lake valley, 295 Brigham Young spoke of his departed leader: We have come here, according to the direction and counsel of Brother Joseph, before his death, and Joseph would still be alive, if the Twelve had been in Nauvoo when he re-crossed the river from Montrose.—Journal History, July 28, 1847. In a sermon delivered in the Bowery, on the Temple Block, on October 6, 1855, President Young expressed his satisfaction that he had known the Prophet: I feel like shouting hallelujah all the time when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet whom the Lord raised up and ordained, and to whom He gave keys and power to build up the Kingdom of God on the earth and sustain it, These keys are committed to this people, and we have power to continue the work that Joseph commenced, until everything is prepared for the coming of the Son of Man.—J. D. 3:51. Again, in a sermon on August 16, 1868, President Young said: In the days of the Prophet Joseph, such moments were more precious to me than all the wealth of the world. No matter how great my poverty—if I had to borrow meal to feed my wife and children— I never let an opportunity pass of learning what the Prophet had to impart. Brigham Young's death occurred in the Lion House in Salt Lake City on the afternoon of August 29, 1877. Anxious watchers at his bedside reported that a few moments before he expired, he gazed fixedly upwards and repeated several times the word "Joseph, Joseph, Joseph," as though he were speaking to his beloved leader. It is not improbable that the Prophet Joseph was there, to take his devoted follower by the hand, Report on the 114th Annual Conference Elder Antoine R. Ivins Member of the First Council of Seventy 114th annual general conference was convened in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, April 6th, at the usual hour, and under the presidency of President Heber J. Grant, with President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Taking charge.. All of the general authorities of the Church, except President Rufus K. Hardy of the First Council of Seventy, were present as were also the presidents of the missions of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. President Hardy was prevented from attending by serious illness which confined him to the hospital. Features of the first meeting were the reading of a message from President Grant, who refrained from speaking upon the advice of his physician; the reading by President Clark of an extensive financial report which shows that the Church is out of debt; the reading of the report of the auditing committee; and the sustaining of the general authorities among whom was the newly chosen apostle, Mark E. Petersen, who comes to his new position from the managership of The Deseret News and the presidency of Sugar House Stake. His appointment met general approval and all were pleased with his spirit as expressed in his remarks to the conference. While our beloved President was Page 296 ACCORDING to custom, the not allowed by his physician to address the conference, he was able to be present, at least part of the time, in all of the sessions except that of Friday evening; and it was not only pleasing, but thrilling, to the great body of Priesthood present, to hear his testimony and counsel again as it was read to us. May God extend his days so long as life may be sweet to him. His message was a powerful testimony to the Church of the truthfulness of the Gospel and the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He began by expressing his gratitude to the Lord for extending his days and increasing his strength, and told of his joy at being able to meet with the Saints again in general conference. He is now able to work nearly half of each day at his office with the consent of his doctor. He told of the many pleasing memories he has of the people who have assembled in the Tabernacle in past conferences—leaders of the Church from President Young on down, and generations of the Priesthood of Israel, mighty men of God who have passed on. Among _ these many memories was the occasion on which he was so blessed of the Lord that he spoke beyond his natural ability to the conversion of a wayward brother. REPORT ON THE 114TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE He was pleased to see that the testimony of the Holy Ghost abides in the hearts of the sons and daughters of these faithful people, and he sorrows to see any of them turn away. He said, "When I look around and realize how many of those who have been wonderfully blessed of the Lord have fallen by the wayside, it fills me with humility." We should forgive the sinner when he repents. "What the world needs today more than anything else is an implicit faith in God, our Father, and in Jesus Christ, His Son, as the Redeemer of the world. The message of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the world is that God lives, that Jesus Christ is His Son, and that they appeared to the boy Joseph Smith and promised him that he should be an instrument in the hands of the Lord in restoring the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this dispensation. I leave this testimony, as a witness to all the world, and I do it in the name of Him whose work this is, even the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen." From here on, the talks of the brethren covered a wide variety of Gospel themes, all appropriate to the occasion and spirit of the conference. Over all there seemed to hover a spirit of peace and good fellowship, of faith and devotion. The much-beloved hymns of the Church were sung in most of the meetings by the congregation with a gusto, power, and harmony most pleasing, we were told by our radio audience. The Sunday morning session was shared by the regular choir broadcast 297 and the Church of the Air for which Apostle Albert E. Bowen was the speaker. As it was Easter Sunday, he developed the theme, "He Is Risen From The Dead," moving through the ministry of Christ to His crucifixion, burial, and_ resurrection. The fact that Christ, having died, actually lives, should be a source of inspiration to all and especially to the mothers of the fine young soldier boys who are likewise making a vicarious sacrifice for their fellow men. There is great comfort in the realization that they will live on. In this session, President David O. McKay discussed the resurrection of Christ in a convincing manner, the following being a very brief summary of his remarks: He began by quoting Job: "Yet in my flesh shall I see God," and then said, "He who can thus testify of the living Redeemer has his soul anchored in eternal truth." The appearance of the Father and Son to Joseph Smith, Jr. Is the latest and greatest testimony of this. Assurance of life after death is the most precious thing a man can have. The apostles of old received this testimony by actual association with the risen Lord. After the crucifixion they were weak and dismayed until they received this assurance. Having obtained it, their strength was absolute. The resurrection of Christ connotes the fatherhood of God, the immortality of the soul, the brotherhood of man. Living the standards of life as taught by Christ is the true foundation of this testimony "I know that my Redeemer lives," and results in being born again. Acceptance of 298 Christ's teaching results im peace and happiness; rejection, in war and bloodshed. AS is usually the case, the Priesthood meeting, which was held Friday evening, was very generously attended and a good spirit prevailed. President Clark chose this' occasion to deliver his message to the conference. After a few introductory remarks, he quoted from Section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants to show that the word of the Lord is given to the people in the inspired teachings of His servants, and these inspired sayings become Scripture. He then read from the Pearl of Great Price to show that no two spirits are equal any more than are the planets of the universe and, likewise, no. Two of us are equal, but nevertheless the Lord said "if ye are not one ye are not mine." We can be one in purpose. Bishops must support the stake program and stake presidents must sustain the Church program. Without this unity we are not the Lord's people. In referring to the Welfare Work, he called attention to the effort to take the worthy poor of the Church off Government relief, stating that he felt sure the time will come when, for these poor, it will be "the Church or nothing." He cited a case of a mother whose children induced her to transfer her property to them, after which she was placed in a public institution. This is contrary to the recommendation of the Church which feels that those first responsible for the welfare of the poor are the children, in the case of parents, and relatives in other cases, after which the Church will assume the burden. To quote him, "It seems to me, Brethren, that there is a way to lead every child to 'honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.' Brethren, I would rather live in a log hut, surrounded by my children, among my old friends, than to live, torn away from all these, the charity inmate of a state palace." Finally, he stated that he believes that the Constitution of the United States was inspired of God, for the Lord said so, the Prophet said so, and the prophets since Joseph have said so. The Lord in the Constitution itself prescribed the way to change its provisions. It is given to protect minorities and the only way to do this is to require the vote of large majorities before it can be modified. He sees grave danger of loss of our liberties in the tendency of small groups to change its provisions. In this Priesthood meeting President McKay spoke again, this time on the necessity of establishing confidence of children in their parents and in the authorities of the Church, as well as confidence of the members in the Church leaders. There were many other appropriate instructions given in the various talks but limited space prevents analysis of more of them at this time. It may be safely said, as we heard on all sides, that it was a wonderful conference and the people who attended, as well as the radio audience, received additional strength and power to carry on in the work of the Lord. Mark E. Peterson Named Apostle Elder Henry A. Smith Church Editor of the Deseret News AT the turn of the century the humble home of two Danish converts, in Salt Lake City, was blessed with the arrival of a new son. It was a home where the Gospel was lived and appreciated and where the parents taught their children, by precept and example, to evaluate and apply in their lives the principles of this message they had received in a foreign land. This humble father and mother reaped a full and joyous reward a few weeks ago when this son stood before a large audience in the great Tabernacle in Salt Lake City and, while bearing a sweet and humble testimony, expressed his gratitude to them for having taught him to believe this message and for all other things they had done for him. He was Elder Mark Edward Petersen who had been sustained on the previous day, April 6, 1944, by the general conference to fill the vacancy in the Council of the Twelve. With hearts overflowing, Christian and Christine Andersen Petersen sat before the radio in their humble home to hear this honored son pay them grateful tribute. They listened joyfully as he extolled the beauties of the home life that had always been his with them, and with his lovely wife and family. Elder Petersen was born November 7, 1 900, and is one of five children. He has two brothers and two sisters, one of them a twin sister. His wife is Emma Marr McDonald Petersen, an accomplished pianist, and they have two daughters, Marian, seventeen, and Peggy, twelve. Elder Petersen is a young man, energetic and thoroughly capable. He brings to his new responsibilities a r ichness of wisdom and experience beyond his years. He possesses a full share of the qualifications of able leadership. He has demonstrated his faith, loyalty, and devotion to the Church. He is a powerful exponent of the message of (Continued on page 352) Contest Announcements-1944 THE Eliza R.

The Republic of Czechoslovakia Dr. Leland Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah F all the autonomous states which the buffeting waves of nationalism created from the wreckage of the old non-national Hapsburg Empire, the strongest and best organized was Czechoslovakia, a republic consisting of the five districts of Bohemia, Moravia, Austrian Silesia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, and comprising an aggregate area ) 54,270 square miles. The first three of these districts, the Slavic inhabitants of which are called Czechs, belonged to Austria, the latter two, inhabited largely by Slovaks and Ruthenians, belonged to Hungary. The dramatic winning of Czechoslovakian independence was largely the work of three great patriots: Thomas Garrigue Mazaryk and Edward Benes, professors, and the brilliant military strategist, Milan Stefanik, commander of the Czechoslovakian legions in France. Conspicuous as a Slovak nationalist, a philosophical liberal and an ardent anti-Hapsburg, Mazaryk was forced to flee his homeland when the great World Wat began in 1914. He spent the next four years disseminating propaganda and organizing opinion in the Allied states of Europe and America. In Russia, he helped organize Czechoslovakian legions; in the United States, he raised funds; in France, he set up propaganda headquarters, everywhere he labored for the cause of Czechoslovakian independence. Benes, a former student of Mazaryk Page 302 and a prolific writer on political, social, and economic subjects, hated the Hapsburg regime just as intense For some time he was professor of philosophy and sociology at the Polytechnic School at Prague. When the wart broke out (1914), he repaired to Paris where, for the ensuing four years, his diplomatic ability and his resourcefulness were great assets in securing hearings for the cause and in keeping UP communications with the revolutionary leaders left behind in Austria-Hungary Says the historian Langsam: All sorts of clever ruses and subterfuges had to be devised in order to maintain communication between the leaders in Paris and those at home. 'The story of these ruses ls fascinating and thrilling, full of arrests and hair-raising escapes, of secret meetings and code telegrams, falsified passports and faked certificates, microscopic messages carried in hollow teeth and pipe stems, and important state secrets betrayed by the Czech servants of unsuspecting Austrian officials. In addition to all this, money had to be raised, capable journalists had to be found, scores of articles, pamphlets and manifestos had to be got up, imprisoned leaders had to be replaced, 'and recognition had to be secured for the National Council of Czechoslovakia (sitting in Paris) as official spokesmen for the Czechoslovak people. (The World Since 1914 P- 447) But the patriots were successful. In the fall of 1918, when Allied victory seemed assured, and after the Allies had listed as one of their wat aims the establishment of an THE REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA 303 GERMANY Warsaw POLAND ROMANIA —Drawing by Evan Jensen CZECHOSLOVAKIA autonomous Czechoslovakian state, Mazaryk, Benes, and Stefanik felt the time ripe to issue a declaration of independence. This was done on October 18. Ten days later, the Czech National Council in Prague, led by Kramars, took over the reins of administration from the imperial officers, in practically what amounted to a bloodless revolution. On October 29, a Slovak National Council voted union with the Czechs, and on November 14, a Provisional National Assembly proclaimed the republic. Fittingly enough, Mazaryk was elected president, Kramars became prime minister, Benes was appointed foreign minister, and Stefanik was chosen minister of war. Benes and Kramars repaired to Paris to represent the newly created state at the Peace Conference. On February 29, 1920, the Provisional Assembly adopted a constitution, modelled after those of the United States and France. The document provided for a democratic, parliamentary regime with a definite separation of powers. The Chamber of Deputies was to consist of 300 members who must be at least thirty years of age and who were elected for six years by the compulsory vote of all men and women over twenty-one; and the Senate, of 150 members, who must be at least forty-five years of age, and elected for a period of eight years by all voters over twenty-six. The ministry was made directly responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. The two houses were to meet in March and October of each year. The president, who was empowered to exercise a suspensive veto, was to be thirty-five years of age or over, and was to be elected for seven years by the two houses meeting together as the 304 National Assembly. It was provided that no one except the first president (Mazaryk) could serve two consecutive terms, although a second re-election after a lapse of a single term was made permissible. There was to be no vice-president. ERHAPS the most pressing domestic problem facing the new state was that of land reform. Under Hapsburg rule, the tendency in all the provinces had been to accumulate land allotments in a few, large holdings. Thus, at one time, thirty-three individuals held one-sixth of all the land in Bohemia, whereas 373,000 peasants owned less than one per cent. In 1918, two per cent of the landowners in Bohemia owned more than twenty-five per cent of the land in that district, while in Moravia nearly one-third of the land was controlled by less than one per cent of the owners, and in Slovakia half the land was in possession of about one thousand persons. One-half of all the farms in Bohemia and Moravia consisted of seven and one-half acres or less. To remedy this situation, the Provisional Assembly, in 1910, passed a series of laws which provided for the expropriation of all estates exceeding in size 375 acres of arable land or 625 acres of mixed arable and non-arable land, with no compensation whatsoever for lands thus expropriated from the Crown or from members of the Hapsburg family. The land thus acquired was to be sold by the state at generous rates and on easy terms to small farmers, ex-service men, and to any landless person who desired to till the soil. Under no circumstances were more than thirty-seven and one-half acres to be assigned to any one individual. Under the operation of this program, by 1926, more than half a million citizens had become "middle class farmers," direct owners of sufficient land to provide an adequate livelihood. This expropriation policy precipitated a quarrel between the Czechish government and the Roman Catholic Church, because much of the land thus confiscated had been Catholic Church property. The quarrel was further intensified because of the successful efforts of the state to abolish compulsory religious instruction in the schools. The government insisted further that the papacy redraw the diocesan boundaries so as to make them conform to the frontiers of the state, that Czechs be appointed to the higher church offices, and that the native tongue be substituted for German or Hungarian wherever the parishes were predominantly Slavic. Some of the radicals went so far as to successfully demand the establishment of a Czechoslovak National Church which proclaimed its independency from the papacy and abolished the requirement of celibacy for the clergy. This Church, however, recruited almost no Slovak adherents and fewer than a million Czech members. The quarrel between the government and the papacy was ended in January 1928, by the signing of a compromise agreement. The diocesan boundaries were to be rearranged so as to coincide with the republic's borders; the state was to continue paying the salaries of the clergy, but was to have a voice in the nomination of bishops, all of whom were to be Czech citizens; all church officials were to be THE REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA required to take an oath of allegiance to the state; and the Czechish tongue was prescribed for certain SEIVICES. From an economic point of view, the newly created Czechoslovakian Republic is one of the most fortunate states in Europe. A splendid system of railroad lines and terminals as well as approximately eighty per cent of the total industries of the defunct Dual Monarchy were acquired by the new state. Though comprising only one-fifth of the area of the old Austria-Hungary, and including only one-fourth of her population (14,000,000), Czecho- - Slovakia possesses four-fifths of the ex-monarchy's manufacturing equipment, including the famous Bohemian glass and pottery works and textile industries, three-fifths of its breweries, nine-tenths of its soft coal, and three-fifths of its iron ore. Agriculturally, | Czechoslovakia is virtually self-sufficient. Bohemia, under the old regime, produced ninety per cent of the empire's sugar beets, eighty per cent of the hops, and seventy-five per cent of the fruit. Forty-two per cent of the land in the republic is arable. Slovakia produces considerable quantities of flax, maize, wine, tobacco, silver, copper, lead, and graphite. Czechoslovakian munition factories are among the most extensive and efficient in the world. More than 800 miles of navigable riverways are found within the borders of the republic. Furthermore, before the German conquest (1939), landlocked Czechoslovakia had secured access to the sea through German territory at Hamburg and Stettin, and through Italian territory at Trieste. These important guaran- 305 tees were incorporated in the postwar treaties of Versailles and Saint Germain. The enormous industrial output of the country has prompted the government to seek foreign markets through cordial trade and business relationships with the outside world. Her best customers, before the recent conquest, were Germany, Austria, Great Britain, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and the United States. With each of these countries and with many others, Czechoslovakia early negotiated favorable trade and commercial treaties. Because of its peculiar geographical location, the question of national security in Czechoslovakia is crucial. The republic is about 600 miles long and varies in width from fifty to 125 miles, with an aggregate area of 54,270 square miles. Landlocked, the country, as already noted, depends upon the postwar peace treaties for its assured access to the sea. Furthermore, the republic is completely surrounded by five countries —Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Austria—the first three consistently hostile to the continued existence of the state; for about half the length of her boundary, the republic is surrounded by a German pincers formed by the southern German and the northern Austrian boundaries. Because of this fact, the Czechoslovakians have vigorously but unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the consummation of the much-feared Austrian — German Anschluss. Then, too, except for the region of the Carpathians and the Erzeburge, Czechoslovakian frontiers offer little natural protection. Because of these unusual topographical features and because of the 306 circumstances which led to the very inception of the state, the government of Czechoslovakia has diligently pursued a policy of international Policy, broken down objectives included: (1) hearty support of the League of Nations as the Protector of small states and the mainstay of peace and Stability on the continent; (2) friendly relations with Russia because of the ties of Slavism and the desire for trade; (3) consistent and uninterrupted Support of the postwar peace treaties; (4) amicable relations with France; and tion of the Little Entente ( 1921), and Czechoslovakia negotiated a treaty of friendship, in which each promised to remain neutral in case the other was third party, to submit all future disputes to arbitration, and to co-operate in Preventing the d regime. Austria, however, has steadfastly refused to enter the Little Entente coalition. Fora while during the late Twenties, bonds of the Little Entente might be loosed because of the drifting of Rumania to. Ward Italy in the evolving European diplomatic alignment. However, the revival of the Anschluss agitation in Germany and Austria after 1926; the conclusion of a treaty of friendship between Italy and Hungary, the latter, Czechoslovakia's most quarrelsome neighbor: the revival of Magyar irredentist agitation which threatened, if successful, to undo the Treaty of Trianon and the very foundation of the coalition of States; and the serious consideration, after 1930, of a Balkan federation to improve economic conditions, resuscitated and gave new life to the Little Entente relationships, MOST difficult of all problems of Czechoslovakia, and one which threatens to become the most disturbing after the Present world crisis, is the problem of racial minorities, In fact, it was this crucial problem focusing in German-inhabited Sudetenland, which led directly to the shameful Munich Pact, a crisis which in turn Precipitated the Hitleristic Conquest and the end of Czechoslovakian independence. The republic before the Conquest (1939) had over 14,000,000 inhabitants, of whom two-thirds were Czechs or Slovaks, The Remaining third was made up of approximately 3,300,000 Germans, 760,000 Magyars, 480,000 Ruthenians, Jews. Been required to sign a minority treaty for the protection of these non-national subjects, and the same guarantee was incorporated in the constitution of 1920. In accord with these Promises, special schools were at once provided for the minorities, the use of a minority language authorized in business transactions where one-fifth of the Population used that tongue, and a voice in the government guaranteed to all groups. The latter was assured through the adoption of Proportional representation in parliament. Despite these guarantees, considerable difficulty has been experienced with minority groups. The millions of Germans of Bohemia and Mo. Tavia, powerful middle-class men of THE REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA prewar days, and intensely disliked by the Czechs, formed a strong and dangerous opposition unit. Until 1926, these groups refused to cooperate and boycotted parliamentary elections. Since 1926, however, largely because of President Mazaryk's diplomacy and influence, a better spirit prevailed for awhile. In that year, two Germans were appointed to cabinet positions in the government and Germans participated for the first time in the general elections. However, extreme nationalists from both German and Czech factions succeeded in keeping alive the flames of animosity existing between the two peoples, and thereby prepared the way for Goebbel's skillful program of Nazi propaganda. Relations with the Carpathio-Russians have been even more strained. Ruthenia was assigned to Czechoslovakia by the Peace Conference in order to provide a new state with a natural boundary in the Carpathian Mountains and also to bring it into direct contact with Rumania, thus forming a solid ring about Hungary. Now, while the Czechs by treaty provisions are bound to grant the Ruthenians autonomy, they have hesitated to do so and instead have appointed Czechs to important offices. The government justified its policy on the ground that the Ruthenians constitute a relatively backward and largely illiterate group, which, if left to themselves, would fall under the control of the better-educated Magyars and Jews within the province. The situation was alleviated somewhat when, in 1928, laws were passed which reorganized the entire provincial administration and granted 307 Ruthenia practically complete local autonomy. The population question is further complicated by the antagonism of the Czechs and Slovaks themselves. The Czechs, who outnumber the Slovaks almost two to one, are somewhat more westernized than their compatriots and tend to dominate the governmental partnership. They have a higher percentage of literacy than the Slovaks and are much more interested in commerce and industry than in agriculture. Disagreements and quarrels, sometimes to the accompaniment of bloodshed, soon arose. The Slovaks accused the Czechs of monopolizing the desirable offices and of violating, at least in spirit, the "Pittsburgh Pact" of 1918, wherein Mazaryk, in order to get the support of the American Slovaks for his Czech-Slovak unification project, was said to have given a promise of Slovak autonomy. Since 1926, thanks again to the diplomatic efforts of President Mazaryk, the tension between the two peoples became very much alleviated. "THE consummation of Anschluss (the annexation of Austria to the Reich) in April 1938, was the signal for more bellicose unrest among the Czechoslovaks. Clearly the aim of Hitler was the annexation of the republic. War was narrowly averted in the month of May 1938. A frontier altercation resulted in the death of two Germans. Hitler promptly cut off negotiations with the Czechs and rushed troops to the border. Czechoslovakia as promptly mobilized and hastened 400,000 troops to her frontiers. France and Russia, as allies of the Little Entente 308 affirmed their support, and when Britain strongly endorsed the Czech position, Hitler withdrew his troops. Nevertheless, despite the untoward turn of this crisis, the Fuehrer did not give up his intentions of incorporating hapless Czechoslovakia within the German Reich,. In September 1938, there occurred renewed uprisings among the - Sudeten Germans. The British ambassador, Lord Runciman, declared later that these had been incited by Nazi agitators. President Benes at once declared martial law. Shortly afterwards, the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, announced his intention of flying by airplane to consult with Hitler. This was to be the first of three trips "to Canossa" which the Prime Minister of England was to take, "successful trips all of them in humiliating subservience to the will of the German dictator." The first flight was to Berchtesgaden, where he was told by Hitler that Germany insisted on the instant inclusion of the Sudeten Germans in the German Reich, even at the cost of a general war. This proposition was not only acceded to by Britain and France, but the two erstwhile friends of the hapless _republic agreed to even greater humiliation; namely, that the reduced republic should "renounce all the treaties of defense with other countries, suppress all anti-German agitation, and enter into close economic relations with the Reich." But even these humiliating concessions did not satiate the Nazi dictator. Continued restlessness by the Sudeten-German minority led to further negotiations and the final conference of interested parties at Munich, in September 1938. Czechoslovakia was an uninvited onlooker as the four statesmen— Chamberlain, Deladier, Mussolini, and Hitler, carved up the unhappy republic, according to the infamous Godesberg ultimatum.' Four zones were to be occupied by the Germans. A fifth was created in which there was supposed to be plebiscites. But the final result proved this stipulation to be a farce. The Germans took what they wanted, marched to within forty miles of Prague, and absorbed about 750,000 Czechs in the new Germany. As they did so, the Poles invaded Teschen, annexing about 80,000 Poles and 100,000 Czechs. Hungary then advanced from the south, crossed the Danube, and took Bratislava. But still the Nazis were not satisfied. Hitler had himself solemnly pledged to go no farther, but he had not the slightest intention of keeping his word. Having swallowed somewhat more than one-third of the area of Czechoslovakia, he was still greedy for more. The Germans, thereupon, demanded and obtained a corridor across what was left of the republic for a military highway; they demanded also and obtained the right to decide on the destinies of Slovakia and Ruthenia. When Hacha, last president of the republic, protested, he, like the Austrian Schuschnigg before him, was summoned before the presence of Hitler. Hacha's going, however, was a mere formality. Even before he reached Berlin, the German army started south and crossed the Czech border. Once at Berlin, the Czech President, berated and browbeaten by Hitler, signed away the independence of his country. THE REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA Simultaneously as he did so, the German army entered Prague. Thus perished the Republic of Czechoslovakia, victim of one of the most ruthless and brutal outrages in all history. Within a new Czechoslovakia, renewed consideration must be given to the vexed and complicated minority problem and even greater concessions must be made. It may be desirable to detach Sudetenland, inhabited almost exclusively by 309 Germans, from the new state. Other than this arrangement, it appears that the problem might be approached and appreciably solved: (1) by giving more autonomy than heretofore was realized to all minority groups; (2) by developing a more integrated nationalism through a well-planted system of education; and (3) by effecting a greater decentralization of public administration.  CONVOY Grace A. Cooper A big ship slid silently from its moorings into the dark water; One, then another, smaller vessel, with its protection in order Slipped into designated place. A thousand men, so recently boys, stood about the darkened deck, Feeling the strangeness of their surroundings. They had come from varied homes, from schools, work; from planned The lives of many had been convoyed Until the call for the duration; Few had been like lone ships, sailing the deep seas, lonely but unafraid; Some were going on a high adventure; Others, resentful, wanted it over with. There were no farewells at the sailing— Only the universal tears from the great heart of a nation.

Services commenced at half past ten a. M., President John Taylor presiding. On his right hand sat his First Counselor, George QO. Cannon, and on his left his Second Counselor, Joseph F. Smith; President Wilford Woodruff and Apostle Lorenzo Snow, of the Quorum of the Twelve, also occupied seats on either side of the First Presidency... Never since the time when we witnessed the remarkable, one might say marvelous occurrences, which transpired in Nauvoo at the time when the mantle of the Prophet Joseph appeared so plainly to fall upon Brigham Young, have we seen any manifestation of divine acceptance so distinctly clear as during the dedication services in the Logan Temple. A sensation as though myriads of angels were in attendance and taking cognizance of that which transpired... The hymns of praise, the solemn prayer offering the house unto the Most High, the words of the servants of God who officiated on that memorable occasion, and the thrilling Hosannas of the multitude, must be vividly impressed upon every one who has the spiritual and emotional nature largely developed.

Kimball, Secretary of the general organization of Relief Society: Dear Sister, I improve the first opportunity after our conference to send you a condensed report of the branches of Relief Society on the Sandwich Islands. Our societies are scattered, and in some localities have but few members. Our sisters here compare favorably with those at home for punctuality in attending meetings... They are faithful in donating and providing for the sick and destitute... There are but few books printed in the native language, the Bible is the principal one; this the natives know almost by heart, they quote Scripture as fast as they can talk. I have introduced sewing into the society... Sarah L. Partridge Whitechapel Branch, London: On Wednesday, March 19, was celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Relief Society of this branch, in their large hall, New Road, Mile End, by a concert or entertainment. The bill of fare provided was of a most varied and liberal character. In some respects this was a model concert, all songs and matter of a questionable character, unworthy of saints, being excluded... Elder H. Garner presided in his usual genial style. Elders Lund and Atkins were likewise present. Toward the close Elder Leo Clawson gave a short address, in which he stated how pleased and gratified he was with the manner the program had been rendered... Many of the Saints attending came from great distances, and there was a fair sprinkling of strangers present.—Alexander R. Clark, Branch Secretary. Page 310 Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon IF one could measure love, one would doubtless find registered high on the scale, the love inspired by Sister May Booth Talmage, who died April 6, at the age of seventy-five. Her spirit was rooted and nurtured in kindliness. Countless are the neighbors, friends, relations, home helpers, missionary sons, and Church members for whom she did thoughtful and helpful deeds. Although in poor health, she had been assisting her husband's brother, Albert Talmage, to publish a magazine for the blind. She was the widow of Dr. James E. Talmage, noted apostle, writer, orator, and intellectual leader in the Church. They had eight children. While her husband was presiding for three years over the European Mission, she freely used her unusual talents and originality in her part of the work. Many people of all ages, both there and in America, will feel that they have lost a close personal friend. A member of the General Board of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association for thirty-eight years, Sister Talmage edited the Young Woman's Journal for two years. She sought truth always, and loved and strove for accuracy. Possessing both wit and wisdom, she added brightness as well as inspiration to any gathering. She lived well-nigh faultlessly the precepts of the Gospel, and in very deed merited the title Latter-day Saint. MOTHERING the world more extensively than ever before, the American Red Cross has a wonderful record of accomplishments for the year ending March 1, 1944. In our fifty-six war centers are 350 overseas clubs which provide recreation—furnishing pianos, radios, books, stationery, food, etc., to our forces. Camp and hospital workers have aided 3,800,000 persons. Home Service workers have helped 2,500,000 people with such problems as financial assistance to soldiers' families, obtaining emergency leaves of absence, and locating negligent soldiers for their families. The Red Cross has collected 2,500,000 pints of blood for plasma, and has recruited 50,000 nurses and trained 65,000 nurses' aids. It has helped 119,000 sufferers from disaster in our own country. With the assistance of a great army of volunteers, it has prepared the astounding number of 925,000,000 _ surgical dressings, has made 12,000,000 garments for war relief, and has packed 5,300,000 prisoner-of-war kits. These are known to reach the prisoners in all countries, with the possible exception of some in Japan. ATTENDING Wellesley College are Chandralekha and Nyantara Pandit, nieces of the famous Nehru, and daughters of the Ranjit Pandits. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, deeply interested in the future of India's women, is responsible for the girls attending Wellesley. Page 311 

Vol 31 June 1944 No. 6 Adapted to the Weakest of All Saints GAY bursts of laughter and the muffled hum of conversation could be heard through the heavy oak door. As a couple opened the door and entered, dim lights revealed groups of people standing or sitting around a room veiled in cigarette smoke. Each person was holding a glass containing a cocktail in one hand while he ate sandwiches, canapes or tidbits with the other. Not much attention was paid to the newcomers, except to make a few general and usually unintelligible, introductions and to enquire what kind of a drink they desired, as one of the hosts recited a list of suggestions. The couple ordered orange juice and ginger ale. There was a slight pause in the conversation of those nearest to them, and then the talking was resumed as before and the cocktail party went merrily and gaily on?not quite so noisy around the couple as elsewhere. They were present out of courtesy to their hosts, and while they strove to appear at ease amid circumstances which were neither pleasing nor agreeable to them, they left as soon as an opportunity presented itself. Once away from the party, they relaxed, and proceeded to enjoy themselves according to their own Mormon way of life. It had been distressing to this couple, however, to note that one of the men present who had gone along with the crowd in smoking and drinking had been reared a Mormon.
To each person on this earth there come temptations. Even the Savior was tempted of Satan. Everyone is constantly confronted with crossroads?one path, straight and narrow, leading to righteousness, and the other, broad and winding, leading to evil whose end is destruction. Especially when one lives away from the main body of the Church, friendships or business relations may cause Mormons to find themselves in places alien to their upbringing and desires. No matter, however, in what surroundings a Latter-day Saint may find himself he should always deport himself as a Latter-day Saint. He should remain one of a "peculiar people," and by upholding all standards enjoined upon him by his Church, his fellows will accord him a respect and recognition never attained by a man or woman who is too weak to uphold Church standards. Even from the standpoint of worldly success, there is nothing lost and much to be gained by a Latter-day Saint always conforming strictly to Church ideals.
When temptations come, urging one to break any part of the Word of Wisdom, it is necessary to let nothing that the world can offer interfere with a strict adherence and obedience to the Word of Wisdom. Anyone who professes to be a Latter-day Saint can do no less, for in giving this revelation the Lord said it was "adapted to the capacity of the weak, and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints." M.C.S. Sketch of My Life Eliza R. Snow Smith Chapter IV HAD it not been for the rich seasons of refreshing from above which we experienced from [time] to time, with renewing influence; it really seemed as though many must have yielded beneath the weight of fatigue and exposure; who were thus enabled to struggle through.
But with all that was so kindly and timely bestowed, deaths made occasional inroads in our traveling camps. Nursing the sick in tents and wagons, was a laborious service; but the patient faithfulness with which it was performed, is, no doubt, registered in the archives above as an unfading memento of brotherly and sisterly love.
The burial of the dead by the wayside was a sad office, and so sad, that had it not been for a genuine feeling of sympathy for the bereaved, I would not have witnessed its performance.
On the 4th of August, we met several of the 'Mormon Battalion' ?husbands and sons of women in our Division; and to see the careworn faces of those women, beaming with the glow of exquisite joy in a happy reunion, after a long, toilsome separation, imparted unspeakable pleasure to us all.
On the 17th, a letter brought by brethren returning to Winter Quarters for their families, was publicly read, confirming the cheering report of the first arrivals, to wit: the Pioneers have found a location in Great Salt Lake Valley?a City site was being surveyed, etc. etc., which prompted a feeling that we had a definite point before us?a future peaceful home.
On the 8th, we met the main body of the Pioneers, led by President B. Young and H. C. Kimball, who were returning to Winter Quarters to spend the winter. It was a joyful time, and so deeply interested and absorbed were all, that no guard was kept, and about forty horses and mules were stolen in the night?some of them were not recovered; which crippled the teams and impeded our progress, for many times, especially in ascending hills, the teams had to be doubled, thus causing much delay. But with all these, and other impediments, we strung along and reached the valley, one company after another, until all had arrived. Our arrival was on the 2nd of October.
Our first winter in the mountains was delightful?the ground froze very little?our coldest weather was three or four days in November, after which, the men plowed and sowed, built houses (huts) etc., during the winter?the temperature truly seemed to have been particularly ordered to meet our very peculiar circumstances. Every labor, such as cultivating the ground, and procuring timber and fuel from the canyons was an experiment?most of us were houseless; and what the result would have been, had that winter been as severe as the succeeding ones, the Lord only knows. The small amount of breadstuff brought over the plains, was dealt out sparingly; and our beef, made of cows and oxen that drew it, was, before they had time to fatten on the dry mountain-grass, very inferior. Those to whom it yielded sufficient fat to grease their griddles, were considered particularly fortunate. But we were happy in the rich blessings of peace, which, in the spirit of brotherly and sisterly union, we mutually enjoyed in our wild mountain home, and what we had, seemed to be multiplied as we carefully and thankfully used it. When the men were toiling in the fields and canyons, the women devoted much time in meeting together?administering to the sick, and in fervent prayer to God for assistance from on high, in behalf of our brethren who labored hard with but little food to sustain them. Some large families detailed a portion of their number, who spent their time in digging the wild "Sego-root," the use of which was taught us by the Indians, of whom we sometimes purchased it, and proved it to be a nutritious, substantial article of food, and not unpalatable. PRESIDENT YOUNG had made arrangements for me to live with his wife, Clara Decker, who accompanied him with the pioneers, and remained in the valley while he returned to Winter-Quarters for the other portion of his family. I found her living in a log-room, about eighteen feet square, which constituted a portion of the East side of our Fort. This hut, like most of those built the first year, was roofed with willows and earth, with very little inclination?the first-comers having adopted the idea that the valley was subject to little, if any rain, and built their roofs nearly flat. We suffered no inconvenience until about the middle of March, when a long storm of snow, sleet, and rain occurred, and, then for several days, the sun did not make its appearance. Mrs. Clara Young happened to be on a visit to her mother,* (who lived outside the Fort) when the storm commenced, and did not return until it subsided. Sally, an Indian girl who had been purchased from a tribe by which she was held captive, was with me. The (Continued on page 351) *See Julia A. Caine, "A Pioneer Homemaker" The, p. 464. Thank You, for Thirteen Thousand New Magazine Subscriptions! Vera White Pohlman General Secretary-Treasurer of Relief Society N August 1943, the General Board of Relief Society appealed for increased Magazine subscriptions in the hope that greater volume would make it possible to continue the subscription rate at $1 per year. Your response was immediate and overwhelming, but truly typical of the spirit of accomplishment and loyalty which characterizes Relief Society women throughout the Church. During the brief interval between issuance of this appeal and the end of the year, thousands upon thousands of new Magazine subscriptions poured into the Magazine office. As a result, Magazine subscriptions were increased from 53,325!4 at the end of 1942 to 66,796% at the end of 1943, an increase of 13,471 Or 25 per cent. Also, as a result, copies of the winter issues were quickly exhausted, as it was impossible to estimate how many orders were on the way and wartime paper restrictions forbade printings in excess of known requitements. Reprints were made repeatedly and as quickly exhausted by the continuing flood of subscriptions. For these reasons, many new and renewal subscriptions were delayed, and many others had to be started with a later issue than was requested. And so our thanks is extended, not only for the subscriptions received, but for the patience and understanding of the many subscribers who were inconvenienced during this period. The extent of the 1943 subscription increase can be realized more fully by glancing at the chart, page 316, which shows growth for the past four years. From this chart it is obvious that more new subscriptions were procured in 1943 than in the preceding three years altogether when 8,931 new subscriptions were recorded as compared with 10,210 during 1943 alone. By the end of 1942 the subscription list was greater by 19,141 or 40 per cent than at the end of 1939. The scanty growth in 1941 and 1942 is doubtless attributable to the fact that unusual activities claimed intensive effort by Relief Society women during that period?1941 marked the final year of the Relief Society membership campaign and 1942 the Relief Society centennial. Last year, 53 per cent of Relief Society members in English-speaking stakes and missions were Magazine subscribers, and this year 69 per cent are subscribers. However, this general rate for 145 stakes and 17 English-speaking missions was exceeded by approximately half the stakes and missions, 11 of them with subscriptions for 100 per cent or more of their members. Only 13 of the 162 stakes and missions failed to increase subscriptions over 1942, but Page  five of these (Emery, North Sanpete, Uintah, North Central States Mission and Northwestern States mission appear in the accompanying table and charts (Pages 320 to 329). INCREASE INSUBSCRIPTIONS DURING FOUR-YEAR PERIOD 1940-1943
Theexperienced significant subscription growth during the four-year period from 1940 to 1943. In 1940, subscriptions reached 50,651, representing an increase of 5,651 subscriptions or 12.57 percent over the previous year of 1939. The following year, 1941, saw continued growth with subscriptions rising to 53,404, an increase of 1,904 subscriptions or 3.55 percent over 1940. This brought the total increase over 1939 to 7,755 subscriptions, representing 17.01 percent growth.
In 1942, subscriptions continued to climb to 56,500, adding 1,176 new subscriptions for a 2.12 percent increase over 1941. The cumulative increase over 1939 reached 8,951 subscriptions, representing 18.74 percent growth over the three-year period.
The most dramatic growth occurred in 1943, when subscriptions surged to 66,780. This represented an increase of 10,210 subscriptions over 1942, a substantial 18.04 percent jump in a single year. The total increase over 1939 reached 19,141 subscriptions, representing 40.17 percent growth over the four-year period.
Note: These figures are from the annual reports and differ slightly from totals for 1942 and 1943 as shown in the Magazine subscription report on page 320 because annual reports and subscription reports were not reconciled for 1942 and because, in a few instances, 1943 figures were necessarily used where annual reports for 1943 were not received in time to be included. THE Pictographs published last year (August) showing status of Magazine subscriptions in relation to members for stakes and English-speaking missions are again reproduced here, Pages 323 to 3209, with the 1943 gains added in red. This chart lists all stakes in alphabetical order, followed by the missions. Opposite the name of each stake and mission is a row of 20 symbols? THIRTEEN THOUSAND NEW MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS each representing 5 per cent of the Relief Society members in the stake or mission. The black symbols represent the proportion of Relief Society members who were Magazine subscribers as of the end of 1942; the red symbols represent the additional proportion of members who became subscribers during 1943; and the light symbols represent the proportion of members who still were not Magazine subscribers by the end of 1943. The decreased rates of the five stakes which failed to maintain or increase subscription rates during 1943 are indicated by another symbol as explained at the top of the chart.. At the end of each row of symbols is a rank number by means of which the corresponding stake or mission may be found in the preceding table, listed in order according to percentage of Magazine subscriptions in relation to members. This table shows for 1943 the number of members, subscriptions, and percentage of subscriptions to members. It also shows comparative ranks for 1943 and 1942, the number of 1942 subscriptions, and the number and percentage of change from 1942. The high-ranking stakes and missions which procured Magazine subscriptions equal to or exceeding 100 per cent of their members head the table with the Australian Mission again in the lead with a new high rate of 139 per cent. Immediately following this highest group of 11 stakes and missions which procured subscriptions in excess of their membership is a group of 49 stakes and missions with 75 per cent or more of their members as subscribers. All of these 60 stakes and missions appear on the accompanying honor 317 roll (pages 330 to 345) together with a list of their respective ward and branch Relief Societies which achieved subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of their members. An additional 78 stakes and 14 missions which, as a whole, did not achieve an honor-roll rating are represented on the honor roll by hundreds of achieving wards and branches. Every English-speaking mission is represented on the honor roll by one or more branches, and 135 of the 145 stakes?all but 10? are represented by one or more wards. The honor roll is arranged in alphabetical order and the name of the Magazine representative appears opposite the name and record of each Relief Society listed. In those instances where no one is appointed as Magazine representative, the name of the president appears. Great credit is due the supervisory stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives, and all of the ward and branch Magazine representatives who have done the arduous work of procuring subscriptions, with the assistance and support of Relief Society officers and members. We express the appreciation of the General Board to these faithful Magazine representatives and to all who assisted them. We also express to these Magazine workers the gratitude ofsubscribers everywhere who are now assured that the subscription price of the Magazine may be maintained at $1 per year because of the outstanding results obtained. S an expression of its appreciation, the General Board is again awarding a free one-year Magazine 318 subscription to all local representatives who procured subscriptions equal to 75 per cent of the ward or branch Relief Society enrollment as of the end of 1943, and is, for the first time, also including stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives in this award. Recipients of this award for 1943 number 848?of which 776 are ward and branch representatives and 72 are supervisory stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives. Only 10 stakes and missions won a place on the 1942 honor roll as compared with 60 for 1943. The number of local Relief Societies appearing on the honor roll more than doubled, increasing from 383 in 1942 to 776 in 1943. It has been the policy heretofore to use only the Magazine subscription report as the source of information for the honor roll. However, three stakes (Juab, Panguitch, and South Summit) and four English-speaking missions (Canadian, East Central, North Central, and Northern California) failed to submit Magazine subscription reports, but reference to the annual Relief Society reports compiled by the secretaries indicated that most of these unreported stakes and missions had local Relief Societies with rates entitling them to a position on the honor roll, and they were therefore included. All subscriptions procured, even those not included in the honor roll, contributed to the tremendous growth in Magazine circulation, without which the nominal subscription rate of $1 could not have been maintained. Furthermore, all subscriptions procured are bringing Relief Society lessons and other organization work, a variety of articles of general reading interest, and high-standard fiction and poetry to nearly 70,000 new and old subscribers. It is interesting to note from the table the shift of stakes from low 1942 rank to high 1943 positions. For example, Bannock Stake rose from 52d place in 1942 to 2d place in 1943, from a percentage rate of 61 per cent to 115 per cent, a gain of 75 per cent in number of subscriptions procured; Shelley Stake advanced from last position to 17th by increasing subscriptions 74 per cent; Highland Stake jumped from 127th position to 25th, increasing its subscriptions by 59 per cent; Mt. Jordan rose from 118th position to 32d with an increase of 67 per cent in subscriptions; and San Fernando Stake went from 115th position to 4oth, increasing its subscriptions by 81 per cent. The greatly increased number of high-ranking stakes and missions and the diminished number of those in lower rank is readily apparent from the following summary of groups in the accompanying table as compared with the previous year's table: Subscription rates 1942 1943 100 per cent and over 2 11 75?100 per cent 8 49 65?75 per cent 27 a6 55?65 per cent 42 35 45-55 per cent 38 2 35??45 per cent 26 9 25?35 per cent 14 1 Under 25 per cent 4 1 Total stakes and missions 161 162 Exceptional rates of increase in number of Magazine subscriptions are also noted for even those stakes which experienced no great shift in THIRTEEN THOUSAND NEW MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS rank from one year to the other, or fell short of a place on the honor roll, but which nevertheless made tremendous gains. For example, the young Western Canadian Mission almost doubled its Magazine subscriptions, winning a place on the honor roll with 3 78 per cent rate for 1943; Cottonwood Stake made the greatest numerical increase in subscriptions in the Church, hoisting its subscriptions from 214 in 1942 to 580 in 1043, an increase of 369 or 175 per cent, but even so fell slightly short of the honor roll without 71 per cent of its members as subscribers; Inglewood Stake increased its subscriptions by 122 per cent, from 227 to 505, but also fell short of the honor roll because of its low position the Previous year; the Central States Mission increased subscriptions from 112 to 285, or 154 per cent; Roosevelt Stake more than doubled subscriptions (115 per cent) by increasing the number from 89 to 191; and Moon Lake Stake made the greatest percentage increase in the Church (201 per cent raising its subscription list from 36 ? to 110. Another year effort by the stakes and missions which have made these tremendous gains should assure them a position on next year's honor roll. The 17 stakes with the greatest numerical increase (200 or more over 1942),
and the 27 stakes and missions with the greatest percentage of increase (50 per cent and more over 1942) are listed separately. Other commendable rates of increase will be rooted by reference to the main table. It is hoped that the impetus and enthusiasm gained during the 1943 Magazine campaign will make the attainment of the honor roll a possibility for even more stakes and missions during 1944, and the removal of all Relief Societies from the low-ranking groups.

Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes From the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104.CAMPAIGNS
In this department of the Magazine for August 1943, reports which had been especially requested from the two missions and eight stakes represented on the honor roll for 1942 were published, showing the methods which had been followed by these Relief Societies in achieving a position on the honor roll. Inasmuch as six times as many stakes and missions achieved a position on the honor roll for 1943, similar reports were not requested from the fifty-seven stakes and three missions achieving this recognition. Accordingly, the reports presented here were all sent in voluntarily and are representative of the spirit and enthusiasm with which Relief Societies throughout the Church entered into the 1943 Magazine campaign, whether or not a place on the honor roll was achieved.
Cottonwood Stake
MERLE S. MUIR, stake counselor in charge of the Magazine, wrote as follows: "Although Cottonwood Stake has fallen short of our desired goal, we still feel we have achieved a great deal. Last year our stake took 155th place with twenty-six per cent. From enclosed report you will see we have seventy-one per cent this year [72d place] for which our ward representatives are to be congratulated. Their efforts and willingness have been an inspiration to me.
"At our stake and ward officers' meeting September 26, a campaign month was planned, a chart and poster of achievement was presented, and awards were offered by the stake. A slogan 'Every member a reader and subscriber' was accepted. The ward representatives presented their methods, and pep talks and suggestions were given.
"At the end of the month's campaign the stake executive officers entertained ward representatives at a luncheon. Miniatures were place cards. Each ward reported fine progress, pledged itself to greater efforts. The awards won were presented.
"All the wards have accomplished a great deal, but special mention should be given Taylorsville and Murray Third Wards which achieved 100 per cent or more, and the Valley Center Ward with eighty-four per cent. Murray Third Ward had only twelve subscriptions last year compared with 144 this year. Credit is due the presidents who have united their efforts and wholehearted support with those of the representatives. They are all enthusiastic Magazine boosters, and I, as stake director, know the Magazine is a spiritual and temporal help to all who read it. May this year's achievements be a challenge to bigger ones next year."
Even though this stake fell slightly short of the honor roll, it procured the greatest numerical increase (369) in subscriptions over 1942 of any stake or mission, and the second greatest percentage increase (175 per cent), as shown on page 321.
Western States Mission
THE following comment concerning the accomplishment of the Grand Junction Relief Society in the Magazine campaign is typical of the enthusiastic effort in the interest of the Magazine, put forth by the Relief Societies of this mission, under the direction of Luceal R. Curtis, mission Relief Society president. This mission was one of the two missions on the 1942 honor roll, and is one of the three missions on the 1943 roll. Altogether, nineteen of the thirty-seven Relief Societies in this mission are listed on the 1943 honor roll, eleven of them with rates of 100 per cent or more. Sister Curtis wrote: "I should especially like to call your attention to the Grand Junction Magazine report. Sister Arva M. Allgood, who is the Magazine representative and also a home missionary, works during the day. A few days before I went to the annual conference in Grand Junction, Sister Allgood finished her washing that she had started the night before and then got out and sold Magazines until it was time to go to work. She was that anxious to report 100 per cent on the Relief Society members taking the Magazine, and as you see from the subscription report, through her ambition and desire to make a good report, she achieved a rate of 120 per cent. Many others have worked hard. It is a real accomplishment, I feel, when branches get more Magazine subscriptions than they have members."
Kolob Stake
THE presidency of Kolob Stake Relief Society submitted the following report of this stake's Magazine campaign: "The Kolob Stake Relief Society, with Hannah M. Clyde as president, Eugenia Bird as Magazine representative and Lela C. Sumsion as assistant, were very successful in putting over the Magazine drive. They were ably assisted by the ward officers and Magazine representatives, and members of the ward Relief Societies who were called to help in this work.
"Much enthusiasm was created by the display of a large ship (see accompanying picture) on which a small star was placed for each subscription. As each ward met its quota a large star was presented at Relief Society meeting, and it was placed on the ship by the ward representative.
"The inclosed poem about the ship was composed by one of our worthy members, Sister Ella Reynolds, as a tribute to TheIt was read in each ward at the time the large star was presented.
"Many of the sisters have expressed their appreciation for the messages brought to them each month by the Magazine. The lessons are a real inspiration and comfort to all of us in these trying ties.? This stake achieved a rating of 102 percent of its members as Magazine subscribers, with all seven wards winning a place on the honor role. This stake was recently reorganized and Zelma Beardall is the new stake Relief Society president. OH, MAGIC SHIP! Oh, Magic Ship! Your sails are set with stars of hope and cheer; Each star means one subscription To the Magazine a year. The lessons that you find inside On pages clean and bright Will store your mind with knowledge And be your soul's delight. Oh, Magic Ship! Emblem of endurance, courage, strength, Your cargo is a precious crew Of loyal, honored saints Who meet each week in search of truth Given by teachers true? Who strive to live the Golden Rule, And serve their Master, too. Oh, Magic Ship! Your compass that will point the proper way Is symbolic of the lessons that we study day by day, Your rudder and the rudder-chain Are much the same to me? As the teaching of the Savior When he said, Come follow me? I will give you Peace" And control your destiny. Come join us, Kolob sisters; Your tiny golden stars Shall crown the sails on our Magic Ship. They are going to take us far? Into the land of knowledge Where with speech, and prayer, and song, SHIP REPRESENTING THEon which a star was placed for each subscription. Each ward was entitled to add the large star to its ship when the ward had reached its Magazine quota. We will mingle with that glorious crowd, Who are a hundred thousand strong. ?Ella Wheeler Reynolds Cache Stake MARY M. WEST, president of Cache Stake Relief Society, which appears on the honor roll with a rating of eighty-three per cent, reports: "We are very happy over 'the success of our Magazine drive this year. We have obtained more subscriptions than ever before in our stake. Our fine Magazine representatives, under the very able leadership of stake Magazine representative NOTES FROM THE FIELD Lettie B. Rich, started out with the determination to do their best. As an additional inducement the stake board offered a $25 war bond to each ward that made seventy-five per cent or more by December 31. We appreciate the fine support our members have given and hope to be able to keep this fine record from year to year." Rexburg Stake THIS stake is one which made a substantial increase in Magazine subscriptions during 1943, increasing its rate from sixty-three per cent in 1942 to eighty-one per cent in 1943. 'Twelve of the fifteen wards of this stake appear on the 1943 honor roll with rates ranging from seventy-five per cent to 115 per cent. During 1943, the stake Magazine representative, Mary E. Hunt, submitted a copy of the monthly Magazine report card used in this stake and a copy of an attractive little booklet of verse dedicated to Therepresentatives of this stake. The report form, printed on a post card, has space each month for the ward Magazine representative to report to the stake Magazine representative the number of subscriptions taken during the month. In this way the stake Magazine representative is kept informed of progress being made throughout the year in the various wards. The little booklet of poetry was arranged by Sister Hunt and contains poems of encouragement to the Magazine representatives, some of which relate directly to Theand others to the opportunities of Relief Society women to serve others. 349 Weiser Stake ERMA B. CHADWICK, president of Weiser Stake Relief Society, recently sent the following interesting and amusing account of the project under way in this stake for a complete set of bound volumes of TheWe are sending Magazines for the years 1922?23?26?28?29? 30?31?32?35?36?41?43 (twelve volumes) to be bound in cloth binding. "We are striving to create a reference and reading library for the use of the women who are caught 'waiting at the church' on conference and leadership meeting days. If you have ever noticed how much a Latter-day Saint woman does wait at the church and then multiplied the hours by the number of women who do wait, you have dealt with big numbers. We aim to make that waiting both profitable and painless with a complete set of bound volumes of the Magazine. The treasure hunt for the necessary copies of the Magazine has led us into the best-hidden trunks under the most-forgotten chests under the most corn in the most remote granaries you could imagine. Eureka! We find them. "We have purchased an interesting little prewar book cupboard to hold these and it will look right empty until these twelve bound volumes arrive, so please 'hurry every chance you get,' our appreciation understood. "To date we have uncovered none for the year 1914. We have nineteen volumes complete and will soon have others, I am quite sure."  MAGAZINE GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS IN 1943, as in previous years, many gift subscriptions were received at the Magazine office from ward and stake Relief Societies for distribution at the discretion of the Magazine office. These gift subscriptions are received with great appreciation by those to whom they are sent, principally missionaries and officers of new mission branch Relief Societies who may not have been able to subscribe immediately themselves. During 1943, these generous and thoughtful gifts came from the Worland, Penrose, and Lovell West Wards of the Big Horn Stake, the First Ward of Shelley Stake, Mesquite Ward of Moapa Stake, Highland Ward of Humboldt Stake, the Farmington and South Bountiful Wards of South Davis Stake, and from the Woodruff Stake. COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE READERS FOLLOWING are excerpts from a few of the letters received by the General Board of Relief Society expressing appreciation for TheTheis arriving in good condition. The material in the first two issues received is inspiring. I've resolved to read it all each month. Even my husband enjoys reading it, and expects me to profit by its suggestions and teachings. ?Bremerton, Washington Enclosed you will find check for renewal of our surely do enjoy our Magazine, more so now that I am not near enough to attend Relief Society meetings. I study the lessons and keep up with the work and on Tuesday afternoon I go over the lesson just as if I were in class. I appreciate the wonderful lessons you have given. I would subscribe for the Magazine if it took my last dollar. ?Colfax, California I was delighted with the prize-winning poems and stories this season. They are all so wholesome, simple, and lovely. ?Ogden, Utah Since becoming Relief Society president I have grown to appreciate the great work that you are doing through your inspiring publication to help these people who are away from the body of the Church. ?San Angelo, Texas Please change my address at once as | don't want to miss a single copy of the Magazine?it is too valuable to me. The reading matter in it is more than worth double the price of the Magazine. ?Atlanta, Georgia This is my first year of taking the Magazine and I can hardly wait from one issue to the other. I surely enjoy them a lot. ?Burley, Idaho Sketch of my Life (Continued from page 33) roof of our dwelling was covered deeper with earth than the adjoining ones, consequently did not leak as soon, and some of my neighbors huddled in for shelter. One evening as several were sitting socially conversing in my room, the water commenced dripping in one place and then in another, and so on; they dodged it for a while, but it increased so rapidly, they concluded to return to their own wet houses. After they left, Sally wrapped herself in her buffalo robe on the floor, and I spread my umbrella over my head and shoulders as I ensconced myself in bed, the lower part being unhitched dry, wet enough before morning. During the night, despite all discomfiture, I laughed involuntarily while alone in the darkness of the night I lay reflecting on the ludicrous scene. The earth overhead being fully saturated, after it commenced to drip, the storm was much worse inside than out, and as the water coursed through the willows and pattered on the floor, waked the stones from the earth above, and they went clink, clink, while the numerous mice which the storm had driven in for shelter, ran squealing back and forth?the Indian girl asleep on the floor, altogether made the situation rather romantic.
A little now about the Indian girl. The same Indian who brought her, had, a short time previous, brought an Indian boy whom they offered for sale, saying they would kill him at sun-down if not purchased. Our people did not credit their threat, but when too late for remedy, learned that it was promptly executed, which prompted some of my neighbors to purchase Sally (whose Indian name was Pitash) when brought in and offered for sale with the same threat; and was placed in charge of L. C. Young. Under our mutual care and cultivation, she very soon became disgusted with her native habits?became neat and tasteful in dress, and delicate in appetite, although at first she crammed herself like a dog. When she had sufficiently learned to communicate her ideas to our language, she informed us that she was of the Pibandy tribe?that her father died ?her mother married again?her step-father was cruel to her and sold her to those of whom she was a captive. She proved to be a good, virtuous woman, and died beloved by all who knew her.

SUMMER PRIMARY MERITS SUPPORT
THE Primary Association is continuing regular meetings during the summer months. Five specific activity bulletins have been distributed as follows: (1) art and crafts; (2) nature and wood lore; (3) games and plays; (4) drama and literature; (5) music. Local organizations will select from this list the activity which they wish to feature. Home cooking and sewing projects will be conducted for girls, and victory gardening and carpentry will be included for boys. The program based on any of these activities should be very attractive to children of Primary age. The Primary is to be complimented upon much leisure time, and may be encouraged to have good attendance during the season when they are out of school and have so much leisure time, and especially will this be so in war time when their services may be needed at Primary.  Mark E. Petersen Named Apostle (Continued from page 299) Mormonism, a speaker much in demand by Church congregations everywhere. Elder Petersen's short career to date has been one of continuous Church service. He filled a mission to Eastern Canada from 1920 to 1922. He has served successively since as a member of the Liberty Stake high council and stake presidency, and the Highland Stake high council and Sugar House stake presidency. He has had long activity with the Genealogical Society, first as a member of the convention staff, and, since 1934, as a director of the society. He is also a former member of the Deseret Sunday School Union General Board. The new apostle brings to his high calling another unusual talent ?an ability in writing. He has achieved in this field, the hard way, beginning as a reporter on the editorial staff of The Deseret News in 1924. His abilities were soon recognized, and Elder Petersen received continuous advancement, becoming news editor, city editor, managing editor, and then general manager of this official Church publication, a position which he now holds. As his scope of influence now widens in pursuit of his added responsibilities, Elder Petersen will draw to him many new friends and associates. They will learn to know and appreciate him for his friendliness and his courtliness as well as his leadership. His pleasing personality added to his unwavering testimony, his loyalty and devotion to duty, and inherent abilities give promise of great achievements by this new junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. LIVING MAGIC Ora Lee Parthesius Fragrant fingers, Cool and slender, Point across the lush alfalfa To the wind-shaped silver poplars And the weathered low brick farmhouse, To the lines of new-washed linen, Checkered cloths and gay plaid dresses, Children's flesh-toned underthings, Overalls in flaunting V's. Did the deep-set eyes of prophets, Of those gaunt old pioneers, Look past sand and sage and loneness? See the irrigation water And the tall sweet clover by it, Pointing with its slim white fingers...? Vision, faith, and sweat and grimness Have created living magic That no chaos can destroy.
