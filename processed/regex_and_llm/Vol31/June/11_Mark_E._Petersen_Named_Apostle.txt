Mark E. Petersen Named Apostle (Continued from page 299) Mormonism, a speaker much in demand by Church congregations everywhere. Elder Petersen's short career to date has been one of continuous Church service. He filled a mission to Eastern Canada from 1920 to 1922. He has served successively since as a member of the Liberty Stake high council and stake presidency, and the Highland Stake high council and Sugar House stake presidency. He has had long activity with the Genealogical Society, first as a member of the convention staff, and, since 1934, as a director of the society. He is also a former member of the Deseret Sunday School Union General Board. The new apostle brings to his high calling another unusual talent ?an ability in writing. He has achieved in this field, the hard way, beginning as a reporter on the editorial staff of The Deseret News in 1924. His abilities were soon recognized, and Elder Petersen received continuous advancement, becoming news editor, city editor, managing editor, and then general manager of this official Church publication, a position which he now holds. As his scope of influence now widens in pursuit of his added responsibilities, Elder Petersen will draw to him many new friends and associates.

His pleasing personality added to his unwavering testimony, his loyalty and devotion to duty, and inherent abilities give promise of great achievements by this new junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
