CONVOY Grace A. Cooper A big ship slid silently from its moorings into the dark water; One, then another, smaller vessel, with its protection in order Slipped into designated place. A thousand men, so recently boys, stood about the darkened deck, Feeling the strangeness of their surroundings. They had come from varied homes, from schools, work; from planned The lives of many had been convoyed Until the call for the duration; Few had been like lone ships, sailing the deep seas, lonely but unafraid; Some were going on a high adventure; Others, resentful, wanted it over with. There were no farewells at the sailing— Only the universal tears from the great heart of a nation. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, June 1, and 15, 1884 "THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS" Editorial: Temple Dedication—The Dedication of the Logan Temple, which took place May 17, 1884, was one of the most remarkable events that has transpired in the history of the Church... Services commenced at half past ten a. M., President John Taylor presiding. On his right hand sat his First Counselor, George QO. Cannon, and on his left his Second Counselor, Joseph F. Smith; President Wilford Woodruff and Apostle Lorenzo Snow, of the Quorum of the Twelve, also occupied seats on either side of the First Presidency... Never since the time when we witnessed the remarkable, one might say marvelous occurrences, which transpired in Nauvoo at the time when the mantle of the Prophet Joseph appeared so plainly to fall upon Brigham Young, have we seen any manifestation of divine acceptance so distinctly clear as during the dedication services in the Logan Temple. A sensation as though myriads of angels were in attendance and taking cognizance of that which transpired... The hymns of praise, the solemn prayer offering the house unto the Most High, the words of the servants of God who officiated on that memorable occasion, and the thrilling Hosannas of the multitude, must be vividly impressed upon every one who has the spiritual and emotional nature largely developed. Editorial Notes: The Exponent of this issue ushers in the new volume and so many of the subscribers are behind in their payments, we wish to-remind them, that they may come forward and pay up, as everybody knows newspapers are not published without money. Now is a good time to settle up all delinquencies, and also to subscribe for the coming year. Extract from Laie Letter: Laie, Oahu, Sandwich Islands, April 17, 1884. Mrs. S. M. Kimball, Secretary of the general organization of Relief Society: Dear Sister, I improve the first opportunity after our conference to send you a condensed report of the branches of Relief Society on the Sandwich Islands. Our societies are scattered, and in some localities have but few members. Our sisters here compare favorably with those at home for punctuality in attending meetings... They are faithful in donating and providing for the sick and destitute... There are but few books printed in the native language, the Bible is the principal one; this the natives know almost by heart, they quote Scripture as fast as they can talk. I have introduced sewing into the society... Sarah L. Partridge Whitechapel Branch, London: On Wednesday, March 19, was celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Relief Society of this branch, in their large hall, New Road, Mile End, by a concert or entertainment. The bill of fare provided was of a most varied and liberal character. In some respects this was a model concert, all songs and matter of a questionable character, unworthy of saints, being excluded... Elder H. Garner presided in his usual genial style. Elders Lund and Atkins were likewise present. Toward the close Elder Leo Clawson gave a short address, in which he stated how pleased and gratified he was with the manner the program had been rendered... Many of the Saints attending came from great distances, and there was a fair sprinkling of strangers present.—Alexander R. Clark, Branch Secretary. Page 310
