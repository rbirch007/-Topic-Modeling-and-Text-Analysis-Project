Gettysburg address, cast in bronze, is given a place at Oxford University, England, as a specimen of the purest English ever written or spoken. The purpose of the Civil War was put in one short sentence: "That this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom." E was a matchless leader of men. He never resorted to coercion. He never surrendered a principle nor compromised with evil. He was great in the noblest and loftiest interpretation of that word. Great in intellect, in heart, in motive—the tenderest and gentlest memory of the ages. He belonged to no church—yet no man practiced more perfectly nor preached more eloquently the precepts of the Master. His proclamations and petitions are scarcely surpassed by the loftiest utterances of the ancient prophets. Under divine guidance, he piloted this Nation through four years black with the tempest of war, and secured peace without dismemberment. During those dark days, his gaunt figure, rising above the din and smoke of battle, sustained and inspired the people. Before the war began, he said: "T know there is a God and that He hates injustice and slavery. If He has a place for me, and I think He has, I am ready." One cannot follow Lincoln from Springfield to Washington when he went to take the oath of office, and read the speeches which he made along the way, and doubt for one moment that he was a man of destiny, trusting implicitly in the guidance and goodness of the Almighty. * For full text of his Gettysburg address see p. 71; for "Lincoln and the Mormon Question," see p. Go. At Columbus, Ohio, he said: "I know that you all know that there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of this Country. So feeling, I turn and look for that support without which it would be impossible for me to perform that great task. I turn, then, and look to the great American people and to the God who has never forsaken them." Speaking before the legislature of New York, he said: "We still have confidence that the Almighty, the Maker of the universe, will, through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, bring us through this as He has other difficulties of our country." At Philadelphia, he said: "I have said nothing but that I am willing to live by and if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, to die by." Henry Watterson, a Southerner, and an orator and editor of renown, who served in the Confederate Army, said of Lincoln: "Surely he was one of God's own, not in any sense a creature of circumstances or accident. I say again and again, he was inspired of God, and I cannot see how any one who believes in that doctrine can believe him as anything else.... Born as lowly as the Son of God, reared in poverty, without name or fame or official training, it was reserved for this strange man late in life, to be snatched from obscurity, raised to supreme command at a supreme moment and entrusted with the destiny of a nation. He was inspired of God, for nowhere else could he have acquired the wisdom and the virtue to do what he did. "Where did Shakespeare get his genius? Where did Mozart get his music? Whose hand smote the lyre of the Scottish ploughman, and stayed the life of the German priest? God alone, and as surely as they were raised up by Him, inspired by Him, so was Abraham Lincoln, and a thousand years hence, no drama, no tragedy, no epic poem will be filled with greater wonder or be followed by mankind with deeper feeling than that which tells the story of his life and death.'" In response to the congratulations of personal friends on his election as President, in 1864, he said: "I should be the veriest shallow and self-conceited blockhead upon the footstool, in my discharge of the duties that are put upon me in this place if I should hope to get along without the wisdom that comes from God and not from man." No man clothed with great power ever exercised it more benignly, endured calumny with less bitterness, looked with deeper compassion and forgiveness upon his enemies, prayed more fervently to God, believed more profoundly in the unfailing justice and mercy of a benevolent Creator than did Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's life is our brightest heritage. He added pride to our citizenship, luster and glory to the flag that waves over us, strength and purity to the government that protects and shelters us, faith and reliance in the justice and mercy and majesty of an all wise, all powerful God who guides and blesses us. Watterson, The Compromises of Life, pp. 179-80 * John Wesley Hill, Abraham Lincoln Man of God, p. 408  Lincoln's Gettysburg Address Delivered November 19, 1863 "Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation—or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated—can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow, this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here; but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task, remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
