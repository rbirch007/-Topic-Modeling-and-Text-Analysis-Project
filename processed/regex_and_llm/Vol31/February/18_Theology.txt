theology lesson of the three-year course on the Articles of Faith, time might well be allowed either at the beginning or close of the lesson for the class, small groups, or individual members to recite the Articles of Faith. Prior to the presentation of the lesson (Chapter 24), it is suggested that a short period, perhaps fifteen minutes, be devoted to a review of the year's work, conducted in the form of a quiz. In conducting the quiz, the class leader should choose four or five women to participate in answering questions; someone should be appointed to judge answers, and someone else to act as timekeeper. Slips of paper containing questions on the year's work, together with their answers, should be deposited in a box. The four or five women chosen to answer questions should sit in front of the class where they may be seen by class members and easily heard. (Opportunity should be given, well in advance of the quiz, for class members to volunteer to participate in this way.) The class leader should draw from the box, one at a time, the slips of paper containing the questions and answers. As each question is drawn from the box, she should read it clearly and distinctly. Then the four or five women chosen to answer questions should be given opportunity to answer. 112 After the question is read by the class leader, the slip of paper containing the question and answer should be handed to the woman chosen to judge answers, in order that she may determine, from the answer written on the slip, whether or not the question has been correctly and adequately answered. A definite and reasonable length of time should be allowed for answering each question. When the time allotted for answering has expired, the timekeeper should indicate this in some way, such as by touching a bell. If it is considered that the question has not been correctly nor adequately answered, opportunity should be given the class to answer it. It is recommended that class members be advised of this quiz well in advance of the date it is to be conducted, in order that they may have ample time to review the subject matter upon which the questions are to be based. Definite study suggestions should be given to the class as a whole, and particularly to the four or five class members chosen to be responsible for answering questions. If no one volunteers to act in this capacity, it is suggested that questions be directed to the class as a whole. Questions and answers for the quiz may be obtained by any of the following methods: 1. At the close of the previous month's lesson, the class leader might assign each of the eight chapters of the Articles of Faith studied this year, to a group of two or three class members, asking each group to hand to her, several days prior to the date of the quiz, one or two questions on its respective chapter, together with the answer to each question. 2. For two or three weeks preceding the quiz, a box might be conveniently placed in the classroom. Class members might be requested to deposit, in the box, slips of paper containing questions and their answers, on the subject matter covered during the past year. 3. The class leader herself might provide questions and answers. Whichever method is used, it is very necessary that the questions be prepared early enough to insure their careful perusal and checking by the class leader. Because of the limited time available for the quiz, not more than one or two questions should be used on each chapter. Persons handing in questions should understand that all questions submitted may not be used; catch questions should be carefully avoided. If the plans for the quiz are well laid and questions and answers carefully chosen and checked, this quiz period will stimulate study and prove helpful and instructive. In order that the class may have opportunity to study and be thoroughly prepared for the quiz, the class leader might even post, one week prior to the date of the quiz, a copy of the questions to be used. Note: This quiz is to be conducted during a part of the time allotted to the class leader for presentation of her lesson, and is in no way to interfere with the regular testimony meeting. Ne the conclusion of Lesson 24 it is suggested that the class leader take time to briefly summarize the threeyear course, concluding her remarks on a note that is conducive to testimony bearing. LESSON DEPARTMENT 113 SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Discourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925. The religion that we have embraced must last a man from Monday morning until Monday morning, and from Saturday night until Saturday night, and from one new year until another; it must be in all our thoughts and words, in all our ways and dealings. We come here to tell the people how to be saved; we know how, consequently we can tell others. Suppose our calling tomorrow is to conduct a railroad, to go into some philosophical business, or no matter what, our minds, our faith or religion, our God and his Spirit are with us; and if we should happen to be found in a room dedicated for purposes of amusement and an accident should occur, and an Elder engaged in the dance is called upon to go and lay hands on the sick, if he is not prepared to exercise his calling and his faith in God as much there as at any other time and in any other place, he never should be found there, for none have a legal right to the amusements which the Lord has ordained for his children except those who acknowledge his hand in all things and keep his commandments.?p. 361 Visiting Sleachers ITlessages to the Flome Sources of Strength Lesson 8?Love Tuesday, May 2, 1944 HERE is one aspect of love, one interpretation of it, which good people find hard to fulfill. We are admonished by the Master to love our enemies and to do good to those who despitefully use us. This story is told: "In the course of the Armenian atrocities, a young woman and her brother were pursued down the street by a Turkish soldier, cornered in an angle of the wall, and the brother was slain before his sister's eyes. She dodged down an alley, leaped the wall, and escaped. Later, being a nurse, she was forced by the Turkish authorities to work in the military hospital. To her ward was brought, one day, the same Turkish soldier who had slain her brother. He was very ill. A slight inattention would have assured his death. The young woman, now safe in America, confesses to the bitter struggle that took place in her mind. The old cry 'vengeance', the new cry 'love', struggled in her mind. Equally to the man's good and to her own, the better. Side conquered, and she nursed him as carefully as any other patient in the ward. The recognition had been mutual, and one day, unable to longer restrain his curiosity, the Turk asked the nurse why she had not let him die. She replied, ?I am a follower of the precept "love your enemies, and do good to them." He was silent for a long time and at last he spoke, ?I never knew there was such a religion. If that is your religion, tell me more about it, for I want it' " Twelve Tests of Character, page 166. Abraham Lincoln had that divine quality in a high degree. Lincoln chose Stanton to be Secretary of War because he felt that he was the best fitted man for that job, although he knew that Stanton had called him "a low cunning clown, the original gorilla." The woman who is too great to be envious of others or jealous of the achievements of others has in her soul a pure and unselfish love. Envy and jealousy are inward foes of human happiness, enemies against which we should wage a relentless war. Envy ruins families, separates friends, and fills the minds of those who harbor it with rancor. Jealousy embitters the heart and shrinks and withers the soul. Love rises above these. "Against the superiority of others there is no remedy but love." To see others have what one wanted; to aspire and be defeated; to plan and fail; and to walk through life with sunlit faces and unenvious hearts is to win a great and noble victory. To be just and generous toward people, to rejoice in the prosperity and success of others is proof of a really great soul. Discussion 1. Discuss the power love gives to the individual from whom it springs, and its effect on an enemy? 2. What do the Scriptures tell us of the importance of love in the relationship of God and man, and between man and man? 3. How may this highest form of love be developed?.

In one in which the measures of government receive their impression so immediately from the sense of the community, as in ours, it is proportionately essential. To the security of a free constitution it contributes in various ways: By convincing those who are entrusted with the public administration, that every valuable end of government is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people; and by teaching the people themselves to know and to value their own rights; to discern and provide against invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful authority, between burdens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society; to discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness, cherishing the first, avoiding the last, and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments, with an inviolable respect to the laws?George Washington.  LESSON DEPARTMENT 5 Home Sopics For optional use on Work-and-Business Day Modern Housekeeping Methods Lesson 8?Dishwashing Tuesday, May 9, 1944 THE United States War Information Chief recently said: "Little things count. We must learn to do the little job?the nuisance that we don't want to do which is so important in winning the World War on the Home Front." 'This statement may appropriately be applied to housekeeping. There is certain work occurring daily in all households which often becomes tiresome to homemakers and yet which must be done regularly and well if the home is to be properly kept. Among these tasks are laundering clothes, straightening and cleaning the house, preparing and serving the meals, and dishwashing. The experienced homemaker recognizes in dishwashing one of the most important problems of the household. With her it is not a problem of whether she likes the job or not, but rather how may she perform the task most quickly and efficiently. | The ability to wash dishes quickly and adequately should be taught to every one in the family. Dishwashing is really a critical process with an important hygienic aspect. Many colds, septic sore throats, and other diseases can be traced to unclean dishwashing. In a soiled, greasy dishcloth germs have everything favorable for growth?moisture, food, and warm temperature. When a germinfested dishcloth is put into clean dishwater, the water immediately becomes polluted and unfit for dishes and utensils. The nearest practical approach to surgical cleanliness is the objective to be sought in dishwashing. Is it more efficient to do the dishes after each meal or only once or twice a day? Here we can run into endless argument because there is no one answer. The writer's answer to this question is?do it now! There are a number of ways in which dishes may be washed and wiped satisfactorily. There is no one best way. There are electric dishwashers now which are used by many hotels and restaurants and which are very satisfactory for washing large numbers of dishes. A few homes also have electric dishwashers, but in the majority of homes dishes are washed by hand. Any good method of washing dishes is based on certain basic principles. Here are the basic principles: Any dish washes more easily if food has not been allowed to dry on it. Since hot water cooks starches and the proteins of eggs, dishes containing these should be soaked in cold water. 'The reverse is true of sugary, sirupy, and greasy dishes. Dishwater washes most effectively if it is hot and soft with mild soapy suds. This suds is made most easily by using flaked or powdered soap. It is foolish to put unscraped dishes into clean dishwater. A rubber scraper or crumpled paper should be used to wipe off all stray bits of food before the dishes are put into the water. A dishpan filled to the brim with soiled dishes does not allow water to reach all parts of every dish. Therefore, only a few dishes should be put into the dishpan at once. There is less danger of dishes chipping if like shapes are put in at one time. Ivory handles and wooden utensils or handles are harmed by standing a long time in hot water. Glassware is washed first, silver second, china third, and cooking utensils fourth. Not less than two waters should ever be used unless you wash your dishes under running water. The rinsing water should be as near the boiling point as possible. Washed dishes which are put into drying racks to rinse should be placed in such a way that the rinse water can reach them on all sides. Shine the glassware and dry the silver. Letting the dishes drain dry is sanitary and saves time. If towels are used: to dry dishes, they should be immaculate. Linen towels leave less lint on dishes than do cotton ones. 'Towels and dish cloths (not tags) are washed and hung to dry in orderly fashion. Once a week all towels and cloths need boiling. Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Discuss the importance of putting everything in order before starting to wash dishes. 2. (a) Give suggestions for removing scorched or stubborn foods from cooking utensils. (b) Discuss the care of utensils. 3. How may dishes that are seldom used be protected from dust and smoke? Discuss care of sinks; of drains. Give a list of tools and supplies for dishwashing that should be readily accessible. 6. Discuss methods of handling dishes and silverware to avoid scratching.

Indeed, this kind of literature is to be found almost exclusively in their writings. There it rises to a distinctive place in literary expressions of intense religious devotion and emotion. They deal fearlessly with vital problems of life, warning against evil, pleading for righteousness, and tevealing, in no uncertain terms, things to come. A clearer understanding of this splendid prophetic literature will be obtained as one gets a plainer view of these prophets of old. "They were not mere foretellers," President B. H. Roberts once told a group of missionaries, "they were rather forthtellers, giving forth the word of God to the people." It happened, of course, that these holy men would at times look ahead and forewarn of days to come. Today, as we read some of their God-inspired prophecies, we marvel at the exactness of their visions of the future. Yet this was only one vital phase of their great work. Outstanding prophets of Old Testament times might well have been called religious statesmen. They played major roles not only in the theocratic government of earlier Israel, but even after it became a kingdom. Think here of Samuel, the kingmaker; of Nathan, who bearded David in the throne room and rebuked him for his sins; of Elijah before Ahab and Jezebel and the priests of Baal. Fearlessly, these prophets of God faced sinners from the king down to the lowest of his subjects, and interpreted God's word and will. These earlier prophets used, however, mainly the spoken word; they were not creators of written prophecy, as were outstanding ones who came later. Those who have left us the Books of Prophecy found in the Bible are commonly called the Major and the Minor Prophets. These terms refer to the quantity, not the quality of their works. Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiah wrote rather extensively; Amos, Hosea, Micah, and other prophets have left us comparatively brief books of prophecy. The role of all of these men of God was essentially the same: to interpret, or speak for God to his people. Their words of truth and light, though born out of and applying to certain social and political situations of their own times, still ring with force and meaning in our own lives today. As with the Bible lyric and the Bible oration, the literature of Prophecy may be more clearly grasped in its historical setting. We shall be able to appreciate Jeremiah's words of woe better, for example, if we remember that this frank and fearless man of God wrote when Judah was in travail, Her people were harrassed by Egypt and Babylon, and her leaders were making unholy alliances, as Jeremiah felt, that would lead his people into terrible troubles. Under the inspiration of God, he prophesied to King Zedekiah that Babylon would overcome the Kingdom of Judah, and its inhabitants would be smitten with the sword and with pestilence. Finally, Zedekiah himself would be taken and Jerusalem burned?this because the people had forsaken God. It was during these same years that the prophet Lehi was warning the Jews to cease their sins or the judgment of God would be visited upon them. But the evil folk hissed and stoned their Prophets; and Lehi, to escape the wrath that he knew was coming, fled with his family into the wilder. Ness. God's word was fulfilled. Judah was ravished and her leaders taken into captivity. The common folk, left without spiritual guidance, intermarried with the idolatrous peoples about them, and became the later despised Samaritans. The Promised Land, with its cities laid waste, its temple destroyed, was only a realm of memories. Yet Over it all shone the star of hope?kept burning by a Book of Prophecy. Isaiah, son of Amoz, years before had foreseen the threatening calamities, and had people: pleaded with his Wash ye, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow... If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it (Isa, 1:16-20). The prophet continues, lamenting the evil that has befallen the people, the harlotry and the murdering, the mingling of princes with thieves, the bribery and injustice. Yet, he foresees the time when "Zion shall be redeemed and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed." Then he breaks forth into this divine prophecy: And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the moun. Tains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more (Isa. 2:2-4), How devoutly millions on earth are praying today for the consummation of this prophecy in its fullness. It is utterances such as this that make of Isaiah one of the most beloved of the Prophets. Though he  LESSON DEPARTMENT suffered through the trials that came and would his People and the world, yet he looked through the He saw clearly would come "pon nations that mock And I will Punish the worlg for their evil, and the Wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause ? ? atrogancy of the Proud to He Pronounced doom on Babylon and Syria, and other nations that the transgression thereof shal] be heavy UPON it" words tragically applicable today. Everlasting: they shall obtain Sorrow and sighing Sa. 35:1, 10, 119 Rhapsody is the word used by Doctor Moulton to Suggest the blend drama to lift lofty thought and high hope before distressed, suffering souls. Ed spirit, the Prophet sees beyond the darkness and g | spited, he visions the Comfort Y?, comfort ye my people, saith your God. - Prepare ye the way of the Lord, ake Straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, And every mountain and hill shall be made low: And the Slory of the Lord shall be red, stubble; the fire shal] burn them." Praise is Ziven to Cyrus, the Per. Sian king, who, conquering Babylon, has liberated the captive Jews to go Awake, awake; put on thy Strength, O Zion; ut on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusa. Lem, the holy city (Isa. 52:1), How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace (Isa. 52:7). Following these lyric outbursts of rejoicing, again God speaks? Behold, my servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high. And after this announcement come the well-known lines: Who hath believed that which we have heard? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? For he grew up before him as a tender plant, And as a root out of a dry ground. He was despised, and rejected of men; A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: Surely he hath borne our griefs, And carried our sorrows: But he was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: The chastisement of our peace was upon him; And with his stripes we are healed. He was oppressed, Yet he humbled himself, And opened not his mouth: As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, And as a sheep that before her shearers is dumb; Yea, he opened not his mouth. And they made his grave with the wicked, And with the rich in his death. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; He hath put him to grief. By his knowledge shall my righteous servant make many righteous: And he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great??Moulton, The Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 528-529. Here we come to the heart of all the prophecies of Isaiah.. His great work was to vision for his people the Redeemer of Israel. He clarified for his people their cherished dream of a Messiah. Hundreds of years before Jesus of Nazareth came to earth, this inspired prophet pictured His divine character and work among men with startling accuracy. On the Brass Plates which Lehi, through the courageous efforts of his son Nephi, obtained from Laban, were these sacred prophecies of Isaiah of a Christ that would come and did come, not only to the Jews, but to the descendants of Lehi in a faraway New World. Isaiah's divine words have rung with truth and uplift down the ages: they are filled with sacred meaning for us today. Discussion and Activities 1. In "The Cotter's Saturday Night" by Robert Burns are these picturesque lines, portraying Bible reading at the poet's own boyhood home: The priest-like father reads the sacred page, How Abram was a friend of God on high: Or Job's pathetic plaint, and wailing cry; Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire; Or other holy-Seers that tune the sacred lyre! In light of your recent studies on Bible literature, explain what is meant by each of the last three lines. 2. (a) What in its broad sense is implied by the word prophet? (b) Cite an instance from the Bible showing how these men of God in trying to hold rulers to righteousness were prophets. 3. Why was it necessary to use the term, "rhapsody," to suggest the spirit and content of Isaiah's portrayal of Zion Redeemed? 4. (a) Be ready to read aloud a stanza or lines from some lyric that is woven into the Rhapsody of Zion  LESSON DEPARTMENT Redeemed (Isaiah Chap. 4o to end of book). (b) What sacred song or anthem has been created from musically beautiful lines in Isaiah? 5. (a) What lines from this Master Book of Prophecy voice the hope of a Messiah, or Redeemer? (b) Read aloud all of the poem picturing the Christ to come, in Isaiah 53. 6. (a) How were the prophecies of Isaiah preserved for the descendants of 121 Lehi? (b) Why are some of these divine prophecies appropriately inwoven with the Book of Mormon? (c) What was the sacred outcome of these prophecies and those of the Nephite prophets for the saints of earlier days on this continent? 7. Why should we all keep the inspired words of our prophets of old as well as our present-day prophets close to our hearts? >
