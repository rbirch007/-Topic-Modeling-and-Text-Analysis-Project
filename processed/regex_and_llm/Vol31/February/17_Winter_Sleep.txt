WINTER SLEEP Clara Tanner Six summers here she worked with trowel and rake And seeds and bare brown earth and rain to make A garden where the earth once fed but weeds. Beneath her hand the hardened bulbs and seeds Burst forth to life anew and riotous bloom, And filled the air with delicate sweet perfume. But now, before the spring's first tiny flower Has blossomed to relieve a saddened hour, She sleeps, and those who loved her see her not, But here remains the change that she has wrought. Though covered now with winter's coat of snow, And sleeping, in the springtime they will grow? The roses, poppies, dahlias, folded tight? Again to gorgeous blooms in colors bright. Let her sleep, too, be restful, sweet, and deep; Let memories her dear ones ever keep. And in another springtime, other clime, May she awake, O God, in thine own time. Tuesday, May 2, 1944 Article 13: "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men, indeed, we may SAY that we follow the admonition of Paul?We believe all things, we hope all things, We have endure many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, OF of good report Or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." 'Lesson Aim: To show that honesty, truthfulness, benevolence, and doing good to all men, aS well as chastity, charity, and the sanctity of the body are CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 24 TALMAGE'S, ARTICLES OF FAITH if In this article of their faith, the charity, church-membership without Latter-day Saints declare their ac adequate responsibility as to i self, love for fellow men, and devoaffliction, and to keep himself untion to God are the guiding pur spotted from the world" (James 3? ciples. Religion without mora ity, 27). Page 109 110 The Comprehensiveness of Our Faith Within the pale of the Church there is a place for all truth?for everything that is praiseworthy, virtuous, lovely, or of good report. The belief of Latter-day Saints carries them forward, even beyond the bounds of knowledge thus far revealed, and teaches them to look with unwavering confidence for other revelations, truths yet to be added, and progress beyond the mind of man to conceive or the soul to contain. We believe in a God who is Himself progressive, whose majesty "is intelligence; whose perfection consists in eternal advancement (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36), a Being who has attained His exalted state by a path which now His children are permitted to follow, whose glory it is their heritage to share. In spite of the opposition of the sects, in the face of direct charges of blasphemy, the Church proclaims the eternal truth: "As man is, God once was; as God is, man may be." As being incidental to the declaration of belief embodied in this Article, many topics relating to the organization, precepts, and practice of the Church suggest themselves, of these a careful study should be made of the following: benevolence; charity or love; the law of fast, with the included offering; the law of the tithe; consecration and stewardship including the social order of the saints; marriage; chastity; and the Word of Wisdom; and the Sabbath Day. Doctrine and Covenants, Section 89: the "Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 27, 1833, known as the Word of Wisdom," is published in full herewith: 1. 10. 11. A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion?. To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days? Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation?. That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make. And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies. And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill.. And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man? Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving.. Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly; LESSON DEPARTMENT 13. And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine. 14. All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the 'staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth; 15. And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and excess of hunger. 16. All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground? 17. Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, WW and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain. 18. And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; lg. And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; 20. And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 21. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.
