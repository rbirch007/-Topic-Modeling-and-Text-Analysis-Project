THE HEART MUST KNEEL Anna Prince Redd They say that time, and time alone, can heal The heart. The words were better left unsaid. When days have gone—the weeks and months that led To years—they still but mock the grief we feel, For every day serves only to reveal Their emptiness. When one we love is dead, The mind, grown numb from loss, untenanted By faith, is locked within its own bastile. We who would smile again must find belief In God, for time alone does not repair The wound of death. Death is the counterpart Of life. Assured of this, we know that grief Is but prolonged that does not bow in prayer. Not time, but God and love, can heal the heart.
