Wist Ye Not That I Must Be About My Father's Business?" President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Ill. THE EVENING SACRIFICE ON THE DAY OF THE PASSOVER AND THE SLAYING OF THE PASCHAL LAMB S the time approached for the beginning of the ceremony of the evening sacrifice—soon after midday—the worshipers would gather into the Court of Women, as many as could be, to observe and participate in the evening sacrifice, which was a burnt offering. At the morning sacrifice, the officiating body of priests had drawn four lots: the first lot designated the priests who were to cleanse the altar and to prepare its fires; the second lot was cast to determine who of the priests would offer the sacrifice, and cleanse the candlestick and the altar of incense in the Holy Place (there were thirteen priests in this group, the one who drew the lot, and the twelve priests who stood nearest to him); the third lot determined who was to offer the incense (this was regarded as the most important part of the ceremony, and if possible, no one who had officiated before in this rite was to officiate a second time); the fourth lot designated those who were to burn the sacrifice and attend to the closing portions of the service. These lots were drawn in the "Hall of Polished Stones," or the Gazith where the Sanhedrin met, which was on the southern side of the "inner court” of the Temple enclosure proper and was either east of the easternmost gates going from the Court of the Gentiles into the Court of the Priests or in a set of chambers, sitting off by themselves, in the southwest part of that court." In the evening service only the third lot was drawn—that for the incense—since, for the other lots, the priests who were designated by the morning drawing also served in the evening." 130/ Edersheim, The Temple pp. 122, 130 ff. 131/The Temple p. 30; Zenos in Standard Bible Dictionary, sub voce "Temple"; Kennedy in Hastings Bible Dictionary (single volumed ed.) sub voce "Temple." 132/Palestine Exploration Fund, 1896, p. 48. 133/The Temple p. 137.  The First Lot When the time came to begin the evening sacrifice, the first of the priests, on whom the first lot had fallen, went to the great brass laver (which stood to the southeast of the altar) where he washed his hands and feet—the nght foot with the right hand, the left foot with the left hand. He then took a "chafing dish" and, ascending the altar, he fixed the fire on the altar, removing the burnt coals which he took down and deposited on the north side of the altar. As he descended, the other priests first washed their hands and feet (as had the first) and taking shovels and prongs, they went up the altar, pushed aside the parts of the previous sacrifice still unconsumed, removed the ashes from the sumed portions of the previous sacfire, piling part of them in the center sarifice. Of the altar and taking the rest down and placing them on a heap which The Second Lot was later removed from the Temple. The one getting the second lot in They then laid fresh wood on the morning and the twelve priests altar fires (only fig-tree wood could who stood nearest to him, would be used on the fire from which the proceed to offer the sacrifice and to incense altar was fed), and then put clean the candlestick and the altar back on the east altar fire the unconof incense which stood inside the outer chamber of the Temple proper; that is, the Holy Place. Page 72 MY FATHER'S BUSINESS After Calmet THE ALTAR OF BURNT SACRIFICE The altar was in three "sections," one atop the other, the second smaller than the first, and the third than the second. The base was 32 cubits square (48 feet), the next above being 28 cubits Square (42 feet), and the top 24 cubits square (36 feet). The altar was about 15 feet high. The top "circuit" (the shelf between the second and top sections) was 6 feet wide and 3 feet from the top of the altar, and 44 feet from the top of the "horns" at each the sacrificial rites. An inclined plane on the south of the altar led from the pavement to this "circuit." those to be wholly consumed was to be sprinkled or thrown below the red line. Nearby was a heap of salt from which was taken the salt with which every sacrifice must be salted—Pres. J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,, p. 10 The "president" now ordered the sacrifice (a male lamb which had been provided four days before) to be brought from Beth-Moked (a chamber in which sacrificial animals were kept in the northwest corner of the outer wall of the whole Temple enclosure—the soreg or outer wall of the Mountain of the House). The lamb was examined to see if it were Levitically fit, and it was given a drink of water from a golden bowl. Then it was tied to a ring at the northeast of the altar. It was then bound by tying together the front and hind legs on each side. Its head was towards the south and fastened through a ring. Its face was turned towards the west. 'The sacrificing priest stood on the east side of the lamb. Orders were now given to open the gates of the Temple. As the last swung open, the priests blew three blasts on their silver trumpets which announced that the evening sacrifice was about to be offered. Upon this signal the gates of the Holy Place were opened, and this constituted the signal for the actual slaying of the sacrifice which was done in this manner: The officiating priest. Drew forward the windpipe and gullet of the lamb, swiftly thrust upward the knife, while another priest caught the blood and "threw" it on the northeast and southwest angles of the altar below the red line as already described for the burnt offering, and poured out what was left at the foot of the altar. While the sacrifice was being hung up, flayed, and cut up, and the Six priests were carrying it to the "tise of the altar" where it was salted, and while three other priests carried the daily meat offering of the high priest, and the drink offering up to the same place, two of the priests of the same lot had gone into the Holy Place; one removed the burnt coals and ashes from the golden incense altar, put them in a golden vessel, and left the sanctuary. 134/ Palestine, 1896, op. Cit. This was to be done as nearly as possible while the lamb was being slain. While the priest outside was "throwing" the blood of the sacrifice on the altar, the other of the two priests in the Holy Place was trimming and refilling the lamps still burning, was removing the wick and the old oil from those that had gone out, and was refilling and relighting them from one of the other lamps. He did not relight the central lamp, which bent westward toward the Holy of Holies, because that could only be relit from the fire from the altar itself. In relighting the lamps, the priest left two for a later part of the ceremony. The Third and Fourth Lots This was the point in the service where the third and fourth lots were cast in the morning. But in the evening service only the third—or incense lot—was cast. Before this ceremony of casting lots took place, the priests offered a prayer, which, according to tradition, was as follows: Prayer of the Priest With great love hast Thou loved us, O Lord our God, and with much overflowing pity hast Thou pitied us. Our Father and our King, for the sake of our fathers who trusted in Thee, and Thou taughtest  them the statutes of life, have mercy upon thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be us, and enlighten our eyes [in Thy law cause our hearts to cleave to Thy commandments; unite our hearts to love and to fear Thy name, and we shall not be put to shame, world without end. For Thou art a God who preparest salvation, and us hast Thou chosen from among all nations and tongues, and hast, in truth, brought us near to thy great name, Selah, in order] that we in love may praise Thee and Thy Unity. Blessed be the Lord, who in love chose His people Israel.155 At one time the Ten Commandments were now repeated, but this was given up in fear that the Sadducees would contend they were the only essential part of the law. The "Shema” he "Shema" Then the Priests assembled re-peated in concert the ''Shema", as follows: Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and thy gates. And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 187 And the Lord spake unto Moses, sayings Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God." Following the recitation of the ''Shema" the third lot (the incense lot) was cast in the morning, and afterwards the fourth lot.  135/ The Temple p. 136. The words in brackets are regarded as later additions. 136/ Deut. 6:4-9. 137/ Deut. 1:13-21. 138/ Numb. 15:37-41. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS But as already stated only the third, the incense lot was cast in the evening. Preparing to Offer the Incense Now came the most solemn part of the entire sacrificial service. The "incensing priest" and  his two assistants (as chosen by the lot) now ascended the altar of burnt offering to the fires. One carried in a silver vessel a golden censer which he filled with incense, the other carried a golden bowl which he filled with burning coals from the incense fire on the altar. They descended from the altar, climbed the steps leading to the Holy Place, and as they entered it they struck the "Magrephah" (a large instrument) at the sound of which the priests gathered to worship from all parts of the Temple, the Levites went to their places for the song service, while the people assembled for purification were drawn up at the Nicanor Gate. As the "incensing priest" and his assistants climbed the steps to the Holy Place, the two priests who had trimmed the lamps and arranged the incense altar, preceded them and removed, "worshipping," the vessels they had left. The assistant with the coals from the altar fire, now arranged them on the altar; the other assistant left the incense on the altar, whereupon he retired, leaving the officiating priest alone in the Holy Place, awaiting the signal of the "president" to burn the incense. It is believed that it was at this point in the service that the angel Gabriel appeared to Zacharias and promised him the birth of a son, John, to be surnamed the Baptist." At the morning sacrifice, the incense was burned at this point in the service; but in the evening service, the sacrifice is now laid upon the fire on the altar, after which the incense is burned. Under this ceremony, the sacrifice was carried to the altar fire and laid on the altar by the same ceremony as in the burnt-offering service already described, save that the high priest himself frequently performed this function," and most probably would do so on this day of the Passover. Thus would Joseph and Jesus get a view of the high priest for they doubtless, as already pointed out, would be in the forefront of the worshipers. Offering the Incense Now came a time of absolute silence throughout all the Temple buildings. After the sacrifice was placed on the altar fire, the "president" would doubtless give a signal indicating that the time for offering the incense had come, whereupon the people would withdraw from the inner court, and spread out their hands in prayer. Then the order would be given to burn the incense, and the officiating priest would place the incense on the fire on the golden incense altar in the Holy Place, and the "odours" thereof would rise to the Lord." Prayer of the Priests and People Thereupon, the priests and the people would offer the following (traditional) prayers: 139/ Luke 1:5 ff. 140/ The Temple p. 141. 141/ Rev. 5:8.  MY FATHER'S BUSINESS True it is that Thou art Jehovah our God, and the God of our fathers; our King and the King of our fathers; our Saviour and the Saviour of our fathers; our Maker and the Rock of our salvation; our Help and our Deliverer. Thy name is from everlasting, and there is no God beside Thee. A new song did they that were delivered sing to Thy name by the seashore; together did all praise and own Thee as King, and say, Jehovah shall reign who saveth Israel. Be graciously pleased, Jehovah our God, with Thy people Israel, and with their prayer. Restore the service to the oracle of Thy house; and the burnt-offerings of Israel and their prayer accept graciously and in love; and let the service of thy people Israel be ever well-pleasing unto Thee. We praise Thee, who art Jehovah our God, and the God of our fathers, the God of all flesh, our Creator, and the Creator from the beginning! Blessing and praise be to Thy great and holy name, that Thou hast preserved us in life and kept us. So preserve us and keep us, and gather the scattered ones into Thy holy courts, to keep Thy statutes, and to do Thy good pleasure, and to serve Thee with our whole heart, as this day we confess unto Thee. Blessed be the Lord, unto whom belongeth praise. Appoint peace, goodness, and blessing; grace, mercy, and compassion for us, and for all Israel Thy people. Bless us, O our Father, all of us as one, with the light of Thy countenance. For in the light of Thy countenance hast Thou, Jehovah, our God, given us the law of life, and loving mercy, and righteousness, and_ blessing, and compassion, and life, and peace. And may it please Thee to bless Thy people Israel at all times, and at every hour with Thy peace. (May we and all thy people Israel be remembered and written before Thee in the book of life, with blessing and peace and support.) Blessed be Thou, Jehovah, who blessest Thy people Israel with peace. When these prayers were finished, 142/ The Temple pp. 139-140. 143/ Numb. 6:24-26. 77 the priest who had trimmed and lighted part of the lamps in the Holy Place, would reenter it and light the two lamps he had not lighted before. Blessings and Responses Then with the "incensing priest," he would take his stand on the top of the steps leading from the Court of the Priests to the Holy Place. The three others who had participated in the ceremonies in the Holy Place took places alongside them, still cartying the vessels they had used, while the rest of the officiating priests grouped themselves on the steps below. Those priests, so gathered together, now went through some mystical ceremony with uplifted hands, and one of them, probably the incensing priest, repeated, the others following him, this blessing: The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace." To which the people would respond: Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting." The Meat Offerings Following this service of blessing and prayer, the meat offering was brought, carried to the altar and, after salting, placed on the fire. Then the meat offering of the high priest (half of which had been offered in the morning) was offered; and lastly the proper drink offering (probably wine)"* was poured out at the base of the altar. 144/ The Temple p. 141. 145/ Kennedy, sub voce "Sacrifice and Offerings" 2 (4); Gen. 35:14; Moore in Encyclopedia Biblica, sub voce "Sacrifice," 35. The Temple Music When this was finished, then the Temple music began. Certain priests stood on the right and left of the marble tables at the north of the altar on which the fat of the sacrifices was laid. At indicated times the priests would blow blasts from their silver trumpets. Not fewer than two nor more than one hundred and twenty could participate in this service. The priests standing on the steps leading to the Holy Place faced the people, thus looking eastward. The Levites were on the steps which led from the Court of Israel to the Court of the Priests. 'They faced the Temple to the westward, with their backs to the people. At a signal given by the "president", the priests on the steps at the entrance to the Holy Place ranged themselves on each side of one of them who struck the cymbals. Then the choir of the Levites began the psalm of the day. This was divided into three parts, and at the end of each part, the priests on the north of the altar blew blasts from their silver trumpets. We do not know on which day of the week (there was a different psalm for each day) Joseph and Jesus were there. But we like to think that perhaps it was the third day of the week when they would sing the 82nd Psalm: God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 146/ Psa. 82. 147/ The Temple p. 190, They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations." This closed the evening service. The Offering of the Paschal Lamb Now would begin the period for the offering of the Paschal lamb. It would be not far from 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon." We have said that probably Joseph and Jesus had gotten as near to the entrance of the Court of Israel (Nicanor Gate) as they could, so that they might be among the first to offer the Paschal lamb sacrifice. By this time, the great courts of the Temple would be crowded almost to suffocation. Tens of thousands of worshipers would be there, each head of family with his lamb. Many would have been there for hours. The animal odors of all sorts must have been oppressive. The lambs, hungry, would be bleating. Relieved of the silence that had just been an incident of their worship, the people would have burst into a hum of conversation which must have swelled into a faint roar. Again, we can but wonder what thoughts passed through the mind of the divinely begotten Youth as He saw all this, and realized, as He must, that all of it was, in some measure, symbolic of the sacrifice He Himself was to make. His mortal eyes must have been dazzled by the pomp and splendor of it all; His mortal mind could hardly have escaped  MY FATHER'S BUSINESS some confusion. But His spiritual eyes and intelligence must have looked through it all, and have seen to the very foundations of all its meanings—the Fall, the death, spiritual and temporal, the Gospel plan to redeem from the spiritual death, His own atonement to redeem from the temporal death. He knew the truth: "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." Division of Worshipers Into Groups By the rules of the Temple, the great concourse of worshipers and sacrifices would be divided into three groups, each of which must have at least thirty persons. As the Paschal services began, the first group would be admitted to the Court of the Priests, and the gates would be closed behind them. The service began with the blowing of three blasts by the priests on their silver trumpets. Along the Court leading to the altar, the priests stood in two rows, one row holding silver bowls, the other golden bowls. Each Israelite slew for himself, on the north side of the altar, his own lamb, and a priest caught the blood in a bowl and passed that bowl to the next priest who handed back an empty bowl, and so the blood passed to the altar, where the priest stationed there "jerked it in one jet at the base of the altar." Following this, the worshiper hung his lamb on a hook along the Court, or on staves resting on the shoulders of men (staves were not used on
