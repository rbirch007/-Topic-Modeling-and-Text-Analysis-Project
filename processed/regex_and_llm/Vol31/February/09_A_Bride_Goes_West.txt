A Bride Goes West Julia Alleman Caine Note: With "'A Bride Goes West," the Magazine presents to its readers the second in a series of historical sketches by Julia Alleman Caine. The first sketch, "'A Pioneer Homemaker," was published in the August 1943 issue of the Magazine. Narcissa Prentiss Whitman, the heroine of "A Bride Goes West," has been called "the noblest pioneer woman of the West," and the "angel of Oregon." ding day," sang the heart of the beautiful Narcissa. The blue eyes burned with happiness and the busy hands lifted dainty garments from the old chest and laid them on the canopied bed. Sometimes the hands lingered a moment over a treasured piece of linen but put it aside, for tomorrow meant a new life—a life far removed from dainty clothes and treasured linen. A life that meant hard work, plain clothes, and a mission house for a home. The sinking sun lingered on the golden hair of the girl as the blue eyes took on a faraway look. The walls of the bedroom disappeared and she felt again the soft wind in the apple orchard as she had felt it last spring when she read the appeal in the missionary paper. White blossoms had drifted down and the hush of a late Sunday afternoon had covered the land when the sentences caught her eye, "My people sent me to get the white man's Book from heaven. I am going back the long trail and the sad trail to my people of the dark land. You make my feet heavy with the burden of gifts, and my moccasins will grow old in carrying them, but the Book is not among them. My people will die in darkness, and they will go on the long path to other hunting grounds. No 6 AT gigs saa is my wedwhite man will go with them and no white man's Book to make the way plain." Surely such an appeal must be answered, and Narcissa, who had dreamed of carrying the Bible to far-off lands, felt again the thrill she had experienced when she wrote the Missionary Society and volunteered to go to the Nez Perce and Fiathead peoples. After many weeks had come the answer, that the Society could not send "unmarried females" into the West. Here her thoughts were interrupted as the sound of a quiet deep voice came up from below, and the bedroom again became the scene of her busy work. The voice belonged to Dr. Marcus Whitman, the man who had made her dream possible. "Tomorrow is my wedding day," echoed her thoughts.... She was going West with her Marcus to take the Indian lads, Richard and John, back to their people; to bring the white man's Book to the people in darkness. These desires were to be realized! Now the hands were no longer slow. The lovely linens were quickly piled on the bed for the younger sisters, and Narcissa turned with resolution to her packing. One beloved thing she could take, the dear little trunk that Harriet had given her. It would bring back thoughts of this very bedroom. She carefully filled it with books and the Page 91  few simple clothes that Marcus said they could carry. A strange dowry for a bride! The next day was a cold February Sunday of 1836, and that evening the church was filled with friends of Narcissa and of Marcus who had so lately come into the village. The pastor spoke feelingly of the joy of service and at the end of the short sermon, the bride and groom came forward to listen to the sacred vows of the Presbyterian marriage service. The deep sincere tones of Narcissa as she vowed "I do" caused the eyes of her friends to fill with tears. The church members then joined in singing a familiar hymn; but before it was finished only the clear voice of the happy bride could be heard as she sang: Yes, my native land, I love thee, All thy scenes I love them well; Friends, connections, happy country Can I bid you all farewell? The roads of New York State were still frozen when the young couple packed their goods into a sleigh and started for the canal in Pennsylvania that would carry them to the Ohio. The farewells were sad, for Mr. And Mrs. Prentiss felt that probably their beloved Narcissa would never return; yet they looked at the joy in the eyes of the two Indian boys, tucked under the heavy robes, and were sure that the Whitmans had chosen the right way. "THE Ohio was finally reached and a steamboat race on the old woodburner, Siam, provided plenty of thrills. The March winds were still cold when the Mississippi was reached. The splendor of the steamboat, Majestic, awed the girl, so unused to river travel. The cabins were elaborately furnished and the tables loaded with foods, and servants stood ready to supply all one's needs. The thoughtful Narcissa began to wonder if her friends had not been overly cautious when they worried about her. Mr. And Mrs. Spalding, also recently married, had joined them at Cincinnati, and the two brides talked happily of the life to come among the Indians. The journey up the muddy Missouri was filled with the adventures incident to early steamboat travel. Sand bars were encountered and at one spot the boat was held fast for some hours. The missionaries became anxious, for time was short and they feared the American Fur Company's caravan would leave them. At Liberty, their fears were realized —the Fur Comparty's caravan had left, and the two missionaries realized that their little band of three men (a layman, W. H. Gray, had joined the party), two women, and two Indian boys must set out alone. Quickly they packed the two wagons with their clothes, books, tools, seeds, and the striped tent. Now began a forced journey that carried them across what is now Missouri and far into Nebraska, with the Platte River as their only guide. They had to hurry, for the Indians they were going so far to teach were hostile in the land just ahead; for they had not known the Book. At last, far up the Platte, Fitzpatrick and his men were overtaken and then they had the protection of the Fur Company caravan which had disapproved so much of taking women along. The days became warmer and A BRIDE GOES WEST when it was considered safe, the missionaries made a camp at noon and erected a shade, with the horse blankets and poles, to refresh the tired women. Then they would be off again—a long straggling company with the cattle ahead, the wagons of the Fur Company next, and finally the missionaries. At night, Mr. Spalding and Dr. Whitman erected a conical-shaped tent of striped ticking, spread down the rubber sheet and piled the blankets on for a bed. Meanwhile, Narcissa prepared the simple meal of dried buffalo meat. They lived on this diet for weeks and one night Narcissa dreamed of smelling fresh bread baking in her mother's kitchen. When daylight came and the journey was resumed she resolved never to waste another crust of bread. Now the mountains towered over them and the men from the Fur Company grew restless and pushed faster, for the Rendezvous was near. South Pass was reached and the grateful Whitmans fell on their knees to thank God for their safety. In July, they reached the Green River, and were greeted by a wild band of Indians and whites who rushed upon them shooting their long rifles and riding round and round the caravan. How frightened the women were until a white face leaned off a horse to gasp, "Women." They were escorted into the camp in state and an old trapper, overjoyed at the idea that this was now American soil, expressed the idea of the camp, "They cannot send these women out of the country. They have come to stay." An English trading company came to the Rendezvous and the mission- 93 aries joined them for the last part of the journey to the Columbia. Now began the real trial over mountains, across rivers and broad valleys strewn with boulders of lava rock. How could these inexperienced people hope to carry a wagon to Oregon? Many times the wagon did overturn and the goods had to be reloaded. Rafts turned over in the river and the men and the Indian boys swam back and forth to bring the baggage across. What an adventure it was for the women to be placed in a crude skin canoe and be towed across by their faithful Indian boys. But the thrill of adventure must have palled as days became hotter and Fort Hall still seemed miles away. The wagon broke and became a two-wheeled cart and the Indian who had been traveling with them threatened to leave for fear of the dreaded Blackfeet. At last, the Fort was reached, Narcissa rejoiced to eat turnips and fried bread. Home with its luxuries was a long way off, but the Fort had stools to sit upon and the Walla Walla River was only twenty-one days distant. Now the crooked Snake River became the guide and the wide valley relieved the eyes of the tired girl who had grown so weary of mountains. The sands burned the feet of the two white women and the black lava rock cut their shoes as they blazed a trail for their sisters to follow. The cart began to show signs of breaking down and the little company questioned whether they could quite reach the Columbia with it unless the load was lightened. What could be left? Narcissa was heartsick when she realized it was to be her little trunk, for seeds and tools must goon. The little trunk would be left behind to rust on the banks of the Snake River and Narcissa prepared to say good-by to it; but an English trader was kind and offered to carry it to Fort Boise. The travelers now met Indians on every side. The Indians were curious and stared at the white women who were so anxious to watch them cook food and play with the Indian babies. The Cayuse Indians showed the women how to prepare roots by cooking them over heated stones. Now mountains loomed ahead and although the missionaries. Had rested at Fort Boise where the women had done their washing in the stream, the little party was forced to travel more slowly. The river had to be crossed and recrossed; each time the cattle were led by the Indian boys swimming beside one of the horses that was a natural leader. The cart had been left at Fort Boise; but the trail that far had proved to be open to caravan travel. And now at last from a high peak they caught sight of the Columbia! What deep emotions of joy must have filled the hearts of Narcissa and Marcus as they glimpsed the country where their new life together would be spent. Soon the little company came to the gardens near Fort Walla Walla. The garden of familiar homey vegetables relieved their tired eyes as they neared the Fort where armchairs seemed the greatest of luxuries. Astounding variety of salmon, potatoes, bread, and butter. They were in civilization again. On Sunday, they held a church service at the Fort and the Indians they had come so far to help, gathThe first meal offered an. Ered around. The prayer, in which the devout Dr. Whitman rededicated his life to service was echoed in all the hearts of the little band who were now home at last. Narcissa played with the Flathead babies. A proud Indian mother brought her baby to show how the little head was bound to a board padded with a squirrel skin; on the forehead was the little cushioned pad and a tight bandage secured the head to the board for three or four months until a fashionable shape was attained! Many miles down the river from the Fort, so they could live nearer to their beloved Indians, Marcus and Narcissa built their home. The first winter was spent in a log cabin heated by a huge fireplace and with blankets for doors. The house faced the broad Walla Walla where two branches of the river joined, and was situated on a wide meadow surrounded by trees. Here, in March 1837, little Alice Clarissa was born and the Whitman home was complete. An Indian squaw was the nurse and Indians visited the cabin each day to marvel at the white child. Her clothes seemed strange and the Cayuse mothers urged Narcissa to tie the little one to the board quickly. Later they brought a te-cach or cradle for the little stranger. The Oregon at last had a real American mission and a center for the friendly Indians who came with all their aches and pains to be doctored. Fast friends were made by the Whitmans but if the white man's medicine failed to take effect immediately, the superstitious Cayuse (Continued on page 102)
