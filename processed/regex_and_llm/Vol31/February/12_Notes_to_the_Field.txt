Notes to THE FIELD Relief Society Women Urged to Jake Advantage of Red Cross Classes THE General Board recommends that Relief Society women take advantage of Red Cross classes in home nursing which are provided in their communities, or which may be arranged for. These courses are highly recommended as being valuable to Relief Society women in the care of their own families. This training is particularly desirable at this time because of the possibility of epidemic and because nursing service for civilians is being greatly curtailed. No charge is made for this instruction, and there are no age limitations nor other restrictions. All women able to attend such classes which now are, or may be, available to them in their communities, are urged to do so.
