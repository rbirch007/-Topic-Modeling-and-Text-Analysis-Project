The Exercise of Religious liberty, Religious liberty, a principle which recognizes the God-given right of each man to his religious views as well as his right to practice the same, has always been cherished by Christian people. Christianity recognizes the dignity and worth of the individual, and grants to every man his free agency in religious as well as other matters. It teaches that man is a child of the living God, by nature a sp9iritual as well as a physical being, with a high and glorious destiny. Through Christ, the Father gave a plan whereby man might attain that destiny, but within the plan was no element of force. President Brigham Young in a discourse delivered July 5, 1855, in reference to the free agency of man said: ?Man is made in the likeness of his creator, the great archetype of the human species, who bestowed upon him the principles of eternity planting immortality within him, and leaving him at liberty to act in the way that seemeth good unto him-to choose or refuse for himself, to be a Latter-day Saint, or a Wesleyan Methodist, to belong to the Church of England the oldest daughter of the Mother Church, to the old Mother herself, to her sister the Greek church, or to be an infidel and belong to no church.? America, a Christian nation, extends to its people religious liberty-the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience. Thomas Jefferson expressed the American concept when he said: ?Religion is regarded as a matter which lies solely between man and his God; he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship.? The sacred right of religious liberty was safeguarded the American people by the Constitutional Fathers when, being divinely led, they created a structure of government, with a body of laws controlling it, whereby a maximum of freedom and liberty to the individual might be assured. Into the Bill of Rights was written the guarantee of freedom of worship. So strong is the belief of Americans in religious liberty that anything which impinges upon it in the slightest degree arouses bitter resentment. The persecutions during the last decade of religionists of all persuasions-Jews, Protestants, and Catholics- in a number of countries outside the United States, have been viewed as unjust, cruel, tyrannical. Indeed, the fact that religious liberty has been suppressed and religious groups persecuted makes war seem entirely justified in the minds of many persons. To Latter-day Saints, who have known religious persecution, the curtailment of religious freedom seems particularly unjust. The Latter-day Saint conception of religious liberty is a lofty one and there is nothing EDITORIAL we would more quickly defend than our religious rights. This is as it should be, because the Father has given us the true Gospel of Christ embodying the doctrine of free agency, and has commissioned us to establish His kingdom upon the carth?a commission we could not fulfill were people denied religious choice.; We do not hesitate to acknowledge religious liberty as one of our greatest blessings, nor would we hesitate to make any sacrifice, however great, to preserve it. But are we as teady to take advantage of the everyday privileges which our religious liberty suarantees?attendance at Sacrament, Priesthood, and auxiliary meetings; the free use of the Scriptures, the right to Proselyte, the right to build temples and houses of worship; yes, even the tight to contribute financially to the Support of the Church that its work may go forward? It is one thing to have a right, but quite another thing to exercise it. Do we sufficiently value our tight to worship, to go each Sunday to the house of worship and partake of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper? Or are we content to know that we can 97 go if we care to do so?yet choose to Stay at home and rest? Do we suf. Ficiently value the right to read and interpret the Scriptures in our own Way so that we make use of this tight? Or do these Sacred Books remain, week after week, unopened in our bookcases? Any liberty is of yalue to an individual only to the extent that he makes use of it. The more he makes use of it, the greater becomes its value to him. This coming Sunday will you make use of the religious freedom which you possess by attending Sacfament meeting? During the coming year will your appreciation of the right to the free use of the Scriptures find expression through your fre. Quent study of them? Wil] you recognize as a blessed privilege, rather than an arduous duty, your opportunities to work in the Church and to worship the Father in peace in church assemblies? These, after all, are the privileges of religious freedom. This is the meaning of liberty as applied to religion?that sacred Principle taught us by the Father and guaranteed us by our Constitution.?B. S. S.
