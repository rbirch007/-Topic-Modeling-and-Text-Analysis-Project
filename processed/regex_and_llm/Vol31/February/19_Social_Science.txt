Social Science What "America" Means Lesson 14?The Need of the Hour Tuesday, May 23, 1944 "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty...."" (I Chronicles 29:11) THE people of the United States face the future with a seriousness seldom, if ever, felt before. Not since the birth of our Government has there been so much fear for the preservation of the foundations of freedom. Civilization all over the world is suffering from a general breakdown of character because the religion of Jesus Christ has not had sufficient effect on the actions and lives of individual citizens. We are in the throes of a world war, the like of which has never happened in all history. Millions of the youth of the world are fighting for the establishment of false governments and paganism. Other millions are giving their lives that true democracy may live and that the message of Jesus Christ shall find deep lodgment in the hearts of men. Righteousness is contending against evil; light is trying to sweep darkness from the face of the earth. Strange as it may seem, there have been wars since the beginning of time?wars that have freed people from oppression; wars that have spelled destruction and dissolution of governments and countries. Such has been "the melancholy epitome of national existence," says a recent writer. "Such has been the world's history since the days of ancient Chaldea, some fifteen hundred years before the birth of Christ, and wars every century of the world since." We live in a solemn hour. Amid the fearful destruction by tanks and airplanes, bombs and shells, it may seem ironic that anyone should still contend that it is ideas that rule the world. Wars come as a result of ideas in the minds of men, and _ if these ideas are bent on destruction because they are born of selfishness and wickedness, bombs will be made and exploded to destroy human lives and nations. Voltaire, the French philosopher, once declared that men will continue to commit atrocities as long as they continue to believe absurdities. 'That is why it is so important that our beliefs be true. While we Americans have had large and deep convictions of the truth of ' democracy and the freedom to worship God as we pleased, we have lacked the understanding and _ the growth of a more pure faith from day to day. While our educational institutions have grown in power and influence and have taken the youth of the land and given them training in the sciences and literature and history, the mote serious business of life, directed as it should be by the word of a Higher Power, has lapsed. What we need at the present hour in the educational world more than anything else is an ethical revival at the heart of education, which will be far-reaching as it grows out of a firmer and deeper belief in the teachings of the Holy Bible. The distinctive part of education should be the knowing mind, not hampered with conceit, pride, nor arrogance, but leading to awe, and from awe to faith in God. No standard of right has ever superseded the Ten Commandments, and the warning that "thou shalt not" is as imperative as it is important. When the Hebrew prophet gave these words, it was a crucial hour in Israel's history. The hour had come for the nobler and more important moral distinctions touching the sacredness of life and the safeguarding of God's name. We have vouchsafed to us many sacred rights and privileges, none more important than that of religious freedom. It is, however, not the freedom for anyone to engage in conduct which is a violation of the criminal laws of the land. Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, claimed the right of religious worship only so long as it did not endanger others. More important still is to remember that every right has its corresponding duty. Another thing which we should know, as American citizens, is that we should give more attention to our inescapable duties than to our unalienable rights. In an address given by the Governor of New York, Thomas E. Dewey, he told a story about an old French working man. France had just fallen, and the message read: "We have lacked an idea. We came to imagine that the proper duty of man was to arrange an easy way of life, individualistic to the point of selfishness. We saw no further than the village pump. We looked upon the State as a universal purveyor, and always spoke of our due, seldom of our duties. This is the peril that may befall America today, the forgetting that free men have duties as well as rights. We cannot have a strong and prosperous society where every one is talking about his rights. If Americans think that their chief duty is to cry for their rights, then America is doomed." Our Government is a democracy. The founders gave it form when the Declaration was drafted and the Constitution was given to the world. The "democratic feeling" has become  LESSON DEPARTMENT the ruling passion of Americans from the beginning of our nation's history. In fact, it had been growing for centuries within the hearts of men. That ancient and formative passion for liberty, that respect for man as man, the sense of justice which is not satisfied until it has set the bondman free, that hospitality which has held the doors of the nation open to all who aspire after freedom, the tolerance which has kept the realm of opinion as free as the realm of action, that almost impracticable sentiment which has been struggling still to realize the equality of opportunity, all these are the inheritance of the spirit, the endowment of our citizenship."
In this day of darkness, there is light, notwithstanding that there are malign forces of evil in the world. The very air we breathe is tainted by them. The very light by which we see is clouded by them. We too easily condone a crooked practice. We do not promptly condemn a dishonorable action. We ascribe too much to the custom of the day, and too little authority to the private conscience. "Toward God, there is too much cynicism, and not enough faith. Toward the honest, old-fashioned virtues of simplicity and honor, of courage and generosity, of punctiliousness in morals and manners, we have lost that deep and abiding respect which our parents had. We are too irreverent in the presence of holy things, and too indifferent in the presence of simple politics.
Our task is to wrestle against these intangible forces and overcome them. Nothing but light can dispel darkness; nothing but clean light can
of those words as recorded in the Bible when Elijah stood upon ancient Horeb: "And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice" (1 Kings, 19:11-12). It is a time of change, but if we can keep a firm grip upon what is good, then there will be beneficent times again.
There are basic institutions in our social life, not one of which is exempt from the attack of the times. Everywhere is feeling the force of the wind. They are the family, the organized state, civil laws, and religion. These institutions represent gains in human history, and are the things we must stand for. They are the things which we hold sacred. We have our homes, our families, where life begins every day and where we live best when we dedicate ourselves to the work of God. We have our religious faith. We did not create nor originate it. It was given to us by the revelators of God. It gives us courage and direction. We have the state, which gives us our schools, our libraries, and our laws whereby we live among our fellow men. We must hold fast to the righteous things we have, and in these days of rank criticism, it is our duty to understand and to appreciate. It is, however, a difficult task to be always sane and fair-minded. "While we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers,? said Washington to his soldiers at Valley Forge, "we should not be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian." We Latter-day Saints have been baptized into a new life. We have been confirmed members of the Church, but our baptism and confirmation lie deeper than the visible signs of something. 'They are the signs of our inner relationship. Our lives must be inward and spiritual first. 'This relationship takes time and growth and discipline, because character cannot be improvised nor manufactured. Character grows, and growth takes time. This is where the Church comes in, with its power and grace, for it offers a changed life through the power of a new devotion?a power which makes a man want to leave behind him old and accustomed ways. Much of the weakness of the Christian churches today is their lack of discipline. The Church of Jesus Christ rises to power in that it causes man to discipline himself by daily companionship and a deepening comprehension of his relationship to his God. In this, we catch something of a light that never passes away? something without which religion cannot live. We may know that all states and nations are but a passing thing in the presence of the Lord; and that all the evil forces of the world that seem to be carrying everything before them, cannot prevail. God has not changed, and He will continue to provide the necessary leaders for our time. So long as we have leaders who can call men to the ideal?that is to the purposes of God?so long will humanity go on toward the day of days when Christ will reign. 'Today is not a day of despair. It is a day of faith in the living God. "Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" (Deut. 37:6). The English poet, John Drinkwater, wrote a few days before his death: We know the paths wherein our feet should press, Across our hearts are written Thy decrees, Yet now, O Lord, be merciful to bless With more than these. Grant us the will to fashion as we feel, Grant us the strength to labor as we know, Grant us the purpose, ribbed and edged with steel, To strike the blow. Knowledge we ask not?knowledge Thou hast lent, But, Lord, the will?there lies our bitter need, Give us to build above the deep intent, The deed, the deed. Questions and Topics for Discussion 1.
