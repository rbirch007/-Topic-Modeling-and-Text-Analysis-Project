Snow Smith CHAPTER VII SOME years before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and long before the thought had entered the mind of Pres. Young to propose a visit to the "Holy Land," the Prophet said to me, "You will yet visit Jerusalem." I recorded the saying in my Journal at the time, but had not reviewed it for many years, and the, to me, strange prediction had entirely gone from my memory ?even when invited to join the Tourist-party, although the anticipation of standing on the sacredly celebrated Mount of Olives inspired me with a feeling no language can describe; Joseph Smith's prediction did not occur to me until within a very few days of the time set for starting, when a friend brought it to my recollection, and then by reference to the long neglected Journal, the proof was before us. While on the tour, the knowledge of that prediction inspired me with strength and fortitude. Accompanied by several very dear friends, on the morning of the 26th of Oct. 1872, I left Salt Lake City, en route for Palestine. In Ogden I was joined by my brother, Lorenzo Snow, and after an affectionate parting with the friends who accompanied me, we took train for New York via Chicago where we spent one day. In New York we met George A. Smith, the President of our party, Elders F. Little and Paul A. Schettler, our interpreter and cashier, Miss C. Little, my lady companion, who left home before me, to visit friends Page 504 in eastern states. After securing our Passports, we steamed out from N. York on the Minnesota?encountered one storm which satisfied my curiosity to witness "a storm at sea," and arrived safely in Liverpool. On leaving London, our party consisted of six gentlemen and two ladies. We visited principal places in Europe, Asia, Africa, Egypt, Greece, Turkey in Europe, etc., and on our return, after a flying trip among our relatives in the States, my brother and I arrived home in July, 1873. In 1875 I compiled the letters written abroad by Pres. Smith, T. A. Schettler, my brother, and myself, and published in a well-bound book containing neatly 4oo pages of instructive, truthful descriptive reading matter making a respectable and useful addition to our home literature. Since that time, I have published seven books, the last and largest, containing. Nearly 600 pages was issued, and a few copies bound in September 1884. My first Vol. Of poems was printed and bound in Liverpool, Eng., under the supervision of Elder F. D. Richards, at that time presiding over the European Mission. A few years later, | sent the manuscript of the 2d Vol. To the same Office for publication, but through some casualty it was lost, or supposed to be, and was missing until I had relinquished all expectation of it, when it was accidently found only too safely deposited in an obscure till in the Office. I ordered the Manuscript returned. And published it in Salt Lake City? SKETCH OF MY LIFE Our printing establishment having, by that time, 800d facilities for book. Making, Including a "Tune-Book," I have, in all, published nine Volumes, besides second editions to several of them, IN Connection with my literary, social, and sacred labors, I have expended considerable time, labor and means in Promoting the culture and manufacture of Silk In our first organization of our "Silk Association" I was appointed Chairman of a Committee to raise means by donation or investment as capital, for this enterprise. We applied to those who were in Possession of wealth. But the Prospect of early proceeds was not sufficiently Promising for their speculating ambition. But we succeeded in obtaining means sufficient to start the manufacture of the raw material, with simple appliances, to fully test the feasibility of success, Provided sufficient interest could be aroused in this direction. Our Cocoons, and reeled silk were examined by proficients in silk culture who visited us from all parts of the civilized world, and in all in.
