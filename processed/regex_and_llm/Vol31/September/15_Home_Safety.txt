Home Safety Claire P. Dorius "Education not legislation is the most effective method to promote home safety." ?Mrs. E. Hendrickson of the New York State Health Department. ABITS of safety must be lived, H not taught by rote or precept; it must be routine procedure so that there may be no confusion when prompt action is required. The old saying, "a place for everything and everything in its place" certainly applies to the teaching of safety. Emergencies come to everyone. Children must be taught alertness to situations without threat of fear. Mothers might well study the procedures used in nursery schools to teach children to act without fear. Is the home really a safe place in which to live? Not according to statistics is this true. About one-third of all fatal accidents (outside of war activities) occur in the home. In one year home accidents have killed 30,000 +=? persons, caused 4,500,000 disabling accidents, of which 140,000 resulted in permanent disability, and cost many millions of dollars. In five years these accidental deaths have totaled 167,000, with injuries and property losses mounting accordingly, approximately one-half of these home accidents occur to children and about one-third to women. An analysis of home accidents shows that they might often have been easily prevented by a little intelligent care. Children set fire to their clothing by playing with matches, by turning up gas burners, and by pulling over lamps. Many Page 534 times they are allowed to play before unscreened fireplaces. Mothers forget to turn the handles of saucepans on the stove inward. Children reach up and pull these handles, often scalding themselves fatally. 'They fall downstairs and out of windows or into tubs of hot water and scrubbing pails. They fall out of bed or get smothered under bedcovers. They turn on hot water faucets. They play with harmful toys and with knives, needles, and scissors if these tools are left around carelessly. Falls account for more deaths and injuries than any other type of home accidents. 'These could be prevented for the most part, if parents would provide sturdily constructed equipment and furniture in sizes to suit the persons using them. Stairways and hallways should be well planned and well lighted. It is not uncommon for family members to stumble over furniture in dark bedrooms and over toys left on floors or stairways. An orderly house may not be proof against accidents, but it offers far fewer hazards than a disorderly one. Urge family members to "keep things picked up." Children should be taught to put away playthings when they have finished with them. Do away with loose boards, small rugs that slide on slippery floors, sticks and stones scattered over the lawn, loose stair carpets, HOME SAFETY and mops and marbles on the kitchen floor. and mops and marbles on the kitchen floor. Many inexpensive ways of accident prevention can be introduced into homes; for example, safety window screens that lock, safety screen hooks and fire screens, a box of sand for slippery walks and steps, and house furnishings with no sharp corners and safety-tested play equipment. Sheaths for scissors, covers for scrub buckets and tubs of water, screens for wringers, railings for porches, and gates for stairways can all be made without much trouble or expense. Baby pens of padded dry goods boxes may be made at the cost of only a little time. Rubber mats and handrails for bathtubs will guard against a fatal fall. Another very inexpensive device is to hang a rope along the cellar stairway to be used as a handrail. Mason jar rubbers may be used to anchor a slippery scatter rug. A kitchen rack to hold all sharp knives preserves the cutting edges and prevents cut fingers. Lamp cords should be placed in corners or along the sides of walls, never out in the room. Proper tools should be chosen for various jobs and handled with safety. Crib covers pinned securely with large safety pins or clamps will prevent the baby from smothering under his covers. Lighting fixtures, poisonous drugs, and matches should be out of reach of small children. During a blackout in one of the large cities in the East, a sixteen-year-old girl died after she had swallowed three tablets of bichloride of mercury believing that they were tablets of milk of magnesia. Could that happen in your home? Needless loss of life through negligence is akin to deliberately planned destruction of life.
Rubbish, which is often the cause of fire, should be kept covered in metal containers until it can be burned. Oily dusting cloths which are inflammable should be kept in metal tins or glass jars. Kerosene should never be used to kindle a fire. All electrical and gas installations in the home should be of standard materials and constructed according to the rules of the National Board of Fire Underwriters. One special precaution to take is to be sure that all electrical equipment in the bathroom is controlled by a wall switch out of the reach of the bathtub. All gas leaks, no matter how slight, should be taken care of promptly.
All homemakers should take advantage of courses offered in first aid and home nursing by the American Red Cross. Such courses will be made available if a group sufficiently large in numbers will make application to the American Red Cross headquarters in the state in which they live. Now that medical care is so difficult to obtain, such knowledge becomes of primary importance to every homemaker.

LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 3?The Priesthood of God Restored For Tuesday, December 5, 1944 Objective: To outline the steps by which man was again given authority from on high. IT is said that the golden age of conversion, is in the late teens. Then a youth questions the truths of life to know which way to set his course. So it was within this crucial period of young Joseph Smith's life that the Lord chose to place him upon a probationary status. Between the ages of eighteen to twenty-two this future Prophet had his yearly meetings with the angel, remained faithful to his trust, denied not his heavenly visitations, and yet lost not the common touch among his fellowmen. His character, for the life of service God had planned, thus was developed in those most important years of his early manhood. During this time there must have come to Joseph the realization that God's way of working with men was a natural way. It was through his word as found in the Holy Scriptures that Joseph first felt the desire to seek his Maker. Now again God had chosen to usher in the fullness of times with added Scripture which could be read and pondered; which could ever be at hand; which could, if read with a sincere heart, quicken the mind and live in memory until it became a constant companion and counselor. Page 536 The plates which rested in the earth were real. They could be handled and kept until their precious truths were permanently caught in the language men know today. There was a sense of belonging that came with so tangible a link between the world of heavenly beings and that of men. Small wonder that Joseph grew in faith as he waited for that day when he was to receive this marvelous treasure through the power of God. That day came, and with it the real and earthly joy of precious things. Upon shining gold, in thickness slightly less than that of a common sheet of tin, about eight inches in width, all of uniform size, and LESSON DEPARTMENT bound together by three rings, were the plates. These formed a book about six inches in thickness. With the book came also the Urim and Thummim, two precious stones set in an arch of silver which was fastened to an ancient breastplate of pure gold, curiously wrought. (See Cannon's Life of Joseph Smith, pages 22-23) These things to delight the eye were even more enhanced by the thought of the great truths of the gospel which were locked within the finely drawn characters upon each plate. Joseph was to have the gift of translation which would unlock their meaning. It must have been with the flush of achievement that this young man of twenty-two yearned to set about this assignment of reading "a voice from the dust." But all was not easy, for, even on his first journey homeward with the plates from the hill, he was assaulted by men who tried to destroy him. No sooner was it learned that the plates were in his possession than persecution dogged his footsteps. So bitter were his trials in Palmyra that he decided to go to the home of his wife's father, Mr. Isaac Hale, in Pennsylvania. It was at this time that Mr. Martin Harris, a well-to-do farmer of Palmyra, came to his aid by providing a gift of fifty dollars to help him on his journey. The story of Martin Harris and his early assistance as a scribe in helping him to translate the records has been covered in the assigned classwork of Lesson Two of this series. It is to our purpose now to center upon the swift-moving events which brought to a completion the translation of the records within a the coming 537 period of but a few months. Oliver Cowdery, who through faith and personal testimony (See Lesson One) was brought to the aid of Joseph Smith as his second main scribe in the undertaking, began, on April 7, 1829, to assist the Prophet. On June 11, 1829, a copyright was secured for the Book of Mormon and arrangements were made with a Mr. Egbert B. Grandin to print five thousand copies for the sum of three thousand dollars. During the fall and winter of 1829, while Joseph visited at his wife's home in Pennsylvania, Oliver Cowdery was busy with the printing and publication of the book. Then, in the spring of 1830, the Book of Mormon became a reality to the world.. Other friends who helped Joseph and Oliver through the bitter persecution that followed them entered upon the scene during these swift passing months. Joseph Knight of Colesville, Broome County, New York; and the Whitmer family, friends of Oliver Cowdery, at Fayette, Seneca County, New York, offered financial aid and a home. Joseph Knight supplied needed funds and David Whitmer the residence. The latter portion of the records was translated at the Whitmer home. While these historical facts add much to the interest of the story of forth of the Book of Mormon, they, in and of themselves, lacked the spirit of testimony that comes through the revelations given to the prophet during this period. Revelations, many of which were prompted by the desire of Joseph and Oliver to know more fully the true meaning of the power of God's word which Joseph read from the 538 plates and Oliver recorded. So it was that the third important step was taken in the establishment of God's work in the latter days?that of the restoration of the Priesthood of God to man. One day during the work of translation, Joseph and Oliver came upon a passage in the Book of Mormon which spoke of baptism for the remission of sins. The words were quick and clear. No one could enter the Father's kingdom except through this ordinance. Had they been baptized? It was clear from the text that in the days of ancient America those who joined the Church of God did so by actually entering into a covenant with God through the waters of baptism. Why shouldn't Joseph and Oliver so comply? They felt the desire and necessity to act in accordance with this doctrine. But how? After discussing the matter at length, they sought answer to their problem through prayer; and so they went outside to the wooded banks of the Susquehanna River that wound its way through the State of Pennsylvania where _they then were living. It was the 15th of May, 1829. Here, in the brightness of the warm spring sunbeams that streamed down through the trees, the two young men knelt and spoke their wishes to God. Presently in a cloud of light that exceeded the brilliance of that beautiful day, there stood beside them a heavenly messenger. Placing his hands upon their bowed heads, he spoke, "Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness" (Doc. And Cov. Sec. 13). The Priesthood of God was again bestowed upon mortal man! Joseph and Oliver now could act in the name of God. The messenger who thus had come declared himself to be none other than John the Baptist known of old in the New Testament who now acted, he said, under the direction of Peter, James, and John. The sweep of a great river lay just beyond the spot where John had ordained these two "fellow servants" of the Lord to the Priesthood of Aaron. "Go and be baptized," he commanded, giving directions that Joseph should baptize Oliver and then Oliver should baptize Joseph. After the ceremony within the water had been completed, then, in turn, Joseph and Oliver ordained each other to the Aaronic Priesthood. Once more the power of God had been made known to Joseph, in company this time with his newfound friend, Oliver Cowdery. Simple and direct though these acts had been, the two young men felt the cleansing power of the ordinance which, performed within the river's flow, had swept away their sins. 'The Holy Ghost fell upon them and they prophesied great and wonderful things concerning the rise of the Church. No longer now was there doubt within their minds as to the meaning and purpose of baptism. They had asked, received, and performed the first step necessary to enter into LESSON DEPARTMENT the kingdom of God. With Pentecostal zeal they set about proclaiming the news of their commission to act in the name of God, citing their authority from the Scriptures. 'Their friends began to receive their testimony, Samuel H. And Hyrum Smith, the Prophet's brothers, being among the first to be baptized. Soon after, several members of the Whitmer family saw fit to accept the authority of the Priesthood conferred upon Joseph and Oliver. It was not long after this that Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris were chosen as special witnesses of the Book of Mormon and were shown the plates by none other than an angel from the presence of God. Sometime later, between the 15 of May and the end of June, 1829, the exact day is not recorded, came the higher Melchizedek Priesthood to Joseph and Oliver under the hands of Peter, James and John, and with this authority the gift and sealing power of the Holy Ghost. Then again before the close of June of that year came the revelation concerning the calling of Twelve Apostles, for the last days, who were to aid in the building of the Church which was to be established with the fullness of the gospel. God would then set in order his work with the power as well as the form of godliness. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first answer the question; second read the assigned part of the 539 Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word," which has been written for our life in this day. The restoration of the Priesthood of God to man in the fullness of times came by way of two earnest young men, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who had learned to treasure up the words of life (Doc. And Cov. 84:85). These fellow servants of the Lord sought diligently to understand this treasure by seeking the wisdom of what they read concerning eternal life, as it unfolded to them during their translation of the Book of Mormon. It would be well in the discussion period of this lesson to draw closer to the hearts of these men by reading the word of the Lord through Joseph to Oliver as this is recorded in Sections 8 and 9 of the Doc. And Coy. First, however, have the class answer the following questions: 1. What are the gifts of the Spirit? Have a class member make a list of these on the board to start off the discussion. I Cor. 1224-11; Moroni 10:8-17; Doc. And Cov. 46:11-26. 2. What is God's way of helping man to help himself? Note the instructions given to Oliver Cowdery in Doc. And Cov., Section 9. 3. Study Section 13 of the Doc. And Cov., phrase by phrase, to catch the beauty and sweep of this simple act which restored again the link between mortal and immortal man. The next question may be used if needed for further class activity or it may be assigned for home study: Section 10 of the Doc. And Cov., concerning the alteration of the manuscript of the fore part of the Book of Mormon has many personal lessons of value to one who would learn through the mistakes of others. What are the passages you would be moved to comment about?  Visiting Teachers Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes Lesson 3?Blessed Are the Meek For Tuesday, December 5, 1944 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth (Matt. 5:5). Objective: To show that meekness is a heroic quality which, if exercised in one's relationships with God and man, entitles him to choice blessings. MEEKNESS is not the sign of a craven; contrition is not cowardice. On the contrary, meekness is teachableness, a mark of greatness. It stands in sharp contrast to arrogance. The man who is inflated with vanity, puffed with pride, filled with self-conceit, who exalts himself, is not in a proper attitude of mind to be taught; he is not meek. Meekness carries with it long-suffering, forbearance and gentleness. "Genuine meekness is the enforced calm which a strong nature commands and produces by saying to its own tempestuous passions, 'Peace, be still.' It is the fruit of resolute control, of stormy and dangerous emotions, the final result of a grand sovereignty over all the hot and rebellious forces that often rage in a strong and earnest nature." Meekness is best shown in the absolute self-control of a strong and impetuous character. Moses was one of the strong men of the earth; he had the courage and fortitude of a hero, yet he was a meek man. We read in Numbers 12:3: "Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth." Moses did a marvelous: work for his whole nation, getting it out of Egyptian bondage in the face of incredible difficulties, and influencing the whole subsequent course of history by his teaching and his deeds. Moses had an open mind, ready to be taught new things.... He did not reject fresh revelation because it was novel.... He was not, in the beginning at least, free from faults of character, but he was too big for intellectual and spiritual pride. By the steady control of his strong nature and by his teachableness, he won a just reputation for meekness. The Savior declared himself to be meek. In Matthew 11:20, he said: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls." The meek shall inherit the earth because they are wise enough to live right, teachable enough to learn the laws by which the earth is inherited, and, above all, strong enough to abide by those laws. By being receptive to the will of our Father in heaven, we, his children, become heirs to all that is good upon the face of the earth. 1/Fox, Emmet, The Sermon on the Mount, pages 31-32. LESSON DEPARTMENT 541 ? Literature New Testament Lesson 3?New Testament Parables For Tuesday, December 19, 1944 EVERY successful teacher from the long ago down to the present has used apt stories to make lessons live. Through a well-chosen, well told story, truth can be lifted from the abstract to the concrete, can be made a living reality for the clearer. More than this, lessons taught with the help of good stories, as all can attest, are most likely to be remembered. Think here of the ancient Aesop, who?legend has it?was a teacher in old Greece. His name is everlastingly linked with classic fables handed down through the ages. Whether all or any of these quaint tales were created by him is an open question; but the tales themselves have certainly both entertained and uplifted thousands upon thousands through the centuries. Their great help has come from the fact that each of them impresses its "moral" ?a practical bit of tested wisdom. Story and moral in these old-time tales are inseparably connected. To suggest one is to recall the other. For example, to say, "Beware of flatterers" brings to mind the fable of the crow who lost a piece of cheese to a wily fox. Or to call back the tale of the boy who played a mean trick by crying, "Wolf! Wolf!" is to remind one of its sequel, "A liar isn't believed even when he does tell the truth." In these fables, many of which are accredited to Aesop, is a helpful heritage. Another type of story, often employed by teachers of long ago, and even used in these days to impress the truth, is the parable. While this kind of story, in common with the fable, helps to vitalize or make concrete life lessons, it differs from the fable in certain basic respects. Usually, the "moral" of the fable can be put in a simple sentence; for illustration, those cited above, or, for further example, the story of the Sun and the Wind, which impresses the truth: Kindness is stronger than force. With the parable, particularly those of the New Testament, it is not usually possible to reduce its inner meaning to such terse terms. Our most profound parables bear messages of deep spiritual meaning. Parable implies parallel or comparison. Generally, it tells a story which presents in concrete, easily understood, comparative form, the principles of truths to be illuminated. Often it begins with such an expression as "like unto," or "it may be likened unto." If the life lesson it portrays requires further emphasis, it may take an explanation, rather than merely a terse sentence, to make its inner meaning plain. 542 All this is clearly illustrated in the following excerpt from the Gospel according to St. Luke (Chap. 8: 415). And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among thorns are they which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring forth no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. Here the Master not only tells why he often taught in parables; but he gives an excellent example of this type of story, which parallels the basic truths of life he would impress on his hearers. This famed "Parable of the Sower," recorded not only by Luke, but by Matthew and Mark, illuminates not only the work of the teacher of the gospel, and its varied results, but that of every teacher. How gratifying would be our work if more of the seeds of righteousness might fall on good ground and bring forth one hundredfold! Another of the well-known parables of the Savior?one that seems to radiate his central message to the world?is that of the "Talents" (Matthew 25:14-30). For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. This parable, as the reader will recall, goes on to tell how the servant with five talents put them to use and doubled them; likewise the one who had been given two, by using them, gained two more. But the servant that had received only one talent, hid it in the earth. After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. And when the reports were given, the two that had put their talents to use and increased them, received these words of commendation from their master: Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. For the slothful servant, who, full LESSON DEPARTMENT of excuses, had failed in his opportunity, there was not only a severe rebuke, but his talent was taken away and given to the one who had ten talents. Then came from the Master this statement: For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not Shall be taken away even that which he hath, A central Purpose of this impressive parable is to drive home the truth: To save our Spiritual gifts, we must use them, As 4 lamp has light only when it gives light, so one possesses the spirit of the gospel only as one radiates the gospel spirit. Further, the more one gives of the gospel light or spirit, the more of it one has. The best things of this life can be kept and increased only as they are shared, This parable impresses one of the central lessons of life taught and exemplified by our Savior: "He that findeth his life Shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it," Another well-known and much loved parable is that of "The Good Samaritan" (See Luke 10:25-37), Throughout the Gospels are other profound parables, used by the Master to illuminate basic principles of true religion. Like sound apples, attractive and wholesome, these precious Stories bear seeds of everlasting truth. Their content and lessons are drawn from simple, understandable things of life. They deal with nature, with the common Occupations?as that of the farmer, 543 the fisherman, the shepherd. Their appeal is universal; their effect, everlasting. From the viewpoint of their place in literature, Dr. Charles A. Dinsmore says: How great an artist further attested in his parables, They have been packed into a Space so small! The characters are sketched, and even their de. Hey are taken from therefore true to life and nature. These stories of such high artistry, radiating light and truth, are a most Precious part of our literary and gospel heritage, Everyone will do well to get closer to them and treasure them. Discussion and Activities 1. Recall some well-known fable, as The Lion and the Mouse," "The Lark in the Cornfield," "The Man, His Son and the Donkey," "The Dog With a Piece of Meat." Tel] each story briefly and give its moral.? 2.

'25:1-13); "The Parable of the Vineyard"' (Mark 12:1-11); "The Lost "" (Luke 15:3-10); "The Prodigal Son" (Luke 15:11-32). Explain briefly the spiritual lesson of the parable you select. 3. (a) What vital value is there in a - good fable or an apt parable for the teach. Er? (b) In what one thing are these two types of stories alike? How are they basically different? 1/Dinsmore, Charles A., The English Bible as Literature?Houghton Mufflin Co, 2/ Jacob, Aesop's Fables, ?or Some other good edition.

Social Science NO social science lesson is printed in this issue of the Magazine as no lesson for this department is planned for the month of December, due to the holiday season.  ANCIENT BOOKS (See Frontispiece Picture) Several sorts of materials were anciently used in making books. Plates of lead or copper, barks of trees, bricks, stone, and wood, were originally employed to engrave such things and documents upon as men desired to transmit to posterity.... Tablets of wood, box, and ivory were common among the ancients; when they were of wood only, they were oftentimes coated over with wax, which received the writing inscribed on them with the point of a style, or iron pen: what was written might be effaced by the broad end of a style. Afterwards, the leaves of the palm-trees were used instead of wooden planks; also, the finest and thinnest bark of trees.... Hence, the word liber [Latin] which signified the inner bark of trees, signifies also a book. As these barks were rolled up, to be more readily carried about, the rolls were called volumen, a volume; a name given likewise to rolls of paper, or of parchment. Paper, papyrus, is a kind of reed which grows in the Nile.... The kings of Pergamus invented parchment.... Made of the skin with which beasts and their members are covered. Of these leaves of vellum or parchment, books of two descriptions were made; one in the form of rolls composed of many leaves of vellum sewed or glued together at the end. These were written on one side only, and required to be unrolled before they could be read. The other kind was like our present books, made of many leaves fastened to one another, and written on both sides.... The ancients wrote likewise on linen.?From Calmet's Dictionary of the Bible, 1847.  HRUMPH  Courtney E.
