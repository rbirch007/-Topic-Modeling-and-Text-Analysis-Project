NOTES TO THE FIELD Modification In Visiting Teachers Program Collections by Visiting Teachers Discontinued. IN view of present provisions for care of the needy through the Church Welfare Program with emphasis upon the bishop as the source of supply, and in recognition of the fact that the women of the Church now contribute for charitable purposes by giving volunteer service on Church welfare projects such as sewing, food conservation, et cetera, the General Board, with the approval of the First Presidency and Presiding Bishopric, has decided that visiting teachers should no longer collect contributions from ward members for either the charity or general funds of the Society. This change is to become effective for the month of October 1944 and thereafter. The change in policy with regard to the collection of donations by visiting teachers does not preclude acceptance through Relief Society officers of free-will offerings to the Society. Visiting teachers will, of course, continue to assist in the collection of annual membership dues. Discontinuance of the collection of charity funds will not, of course, ? affect the nature of Relief Society charity work as it has been contemplated since inception of the Church Welfare Plan. This Plan provides for bishops to meet all expenses incident to assisting those in need, and for the Relief Society to provide service, both on welfare production projects and in assisting bishops in determining needs of families requiring aid and in distributing assistance to them. Preparatory steps in this direction were taken by the General Board through recommendations made at general conferences of Relief Society in October 1940 (Magazine for November 1940, p. 756) and April 1941 (Magazine for May 1941, p. 293) when, in order to avoid duplication by the Relief Society of the charity work of the bishops, modified uses of the Relief Society charity funds were authorized. These recommendations also appear on page 8 of the instructions accompanying family welfare forms issued | to all ward Relief Society presidents for use beginning January 1942. These modifications restricted the use of Relief Society charity funds to emergencies where the bishop could not be reached, and extended the use of these funds for purposes related to welfare work, such as payment for professional and other services for those in distress, and purchase of sewing machines, other equipment. And materials for conduct of Relief Society welfare projects. Now, with the continuing development of the Church Welfare Plan and the attendant diminishing use of Relief Society charity funds. The General Board has authorized the discontinuance of collections by the visiting teachers, placing the Page 511 Society in full conformity with the Church Welfare Plan. Effective January 1, 1945, charity fund balances will be combined with the general fund. In the meantime, specific instructions for accomplishing this will be issued by the General Secretary-Treasurer. These combined funds may hereafter be used for the general operating expenses of the local Society, such as purchase of record books, textbooks, sewing machines, and other equipment and supplies for Relief Society purposes. Relief Society funds are no longer to be used for purchasing materials to fill Church Welfare assignments, as was especially authorized for 1943 and 1944 assignments; responsibility for raising funds incident to Church Welfare assignments tests with Church Welfare committees in stakes and wards. It is recognized that discontinuance of collections by the visiting teachers will also affect the general | fund inasmuch as the collections during the four summer months have, since 1941, been placed in the general rather than the charity fund. Hereafter, local Relief Societies will derive general funds for their operating expenses from the proportion of annual dues (10 cents per member) retained in the ward, from earnings through quilting service, sale of handwork at bazaars, or other activities, or from participation in the ward budget plan. Visiting Teachers' Training and Report Meetings Combined Effective for October 1944, and thereafter, the visiting teachers' training meeting heretofore held on the first Tuesday of the month (October through May) and the report of visits heretofore made at the work meeting on the second Tuesday of the month throughout the year, are to be combined in one training-report meeting to be held on the first Tuesday of each month (October through May) preceding the regular Relief Society meeting. This will leave the work meeting on the second Tuesday of the month entirely free (except during the four summer months) for the sewing and other activities suggested for this day in the Magazine for July 1944, pp. 387- 390. Until revised visiting teachers' report books and ward record books are issued for use at the beginning of 1945, the present visiting teachers' report books will continue to be used, but need show only record of visits made and annual dues collected; the reports of visits, which are to be handed in at the training-report meeting will be recorded in the space provided in the minutes of the work meeting for the same month in which the visits are made. For example, visits made during October are to be recorded in the minutes of the October work meeting, although the training-report meeting at which October visits are reported will not occur until the first Tuesday in November. During the summer months (June through September) no training-report meetings are required, but visiting teachers will, during these months, hand in written reports of visits to the secretary at the monthly work meeting on the second Tuesday. For example, reports of the May visits will be handed in at the June work meeting, and so forth. Reports of September visits will, of course, be made at the October training-report meeting.  NOTES TO THE FIELD Procedure for Training-Report Meeting Following are the recommendations of the General Board for conducting this combined training-report meeting: 1. That the training-report meeting be held on the first Tuesday of each month (October through May) preceding the regular Relief Society meeting, and that 10 to 15 minutes be allowed between the two meetings in order that there will be sufficient time to greet Relief Society members arriving for the second meeting. 2. That the length of the meeting be approximately 30 minutes, except in large wards requiring more time for reports, where 45 minutes should be sufficient. 3. That the procedure and division of time of the meeting be as follows: A. Roll call by districts, with response by either of the two teachers assigned to the district who will give verbally the following information: (1) Number of families in district. (2) Total number of visits attempted. (3) Number of families found at home and number not at home. (4) Number of homes in which the visiting teachers' message was discussed. B. Discussion of visiting teachers' message for current month (10 to 15 minutes) led by visiting teachers' message leader. C. Suggestions, instructions, and 513 consideration of special visiting teachers' problems (lc minutes )?ward president. D. Submittal to secretary, at close of meeting, of monthly report slip from Visiting Teachers' Report Book. 4. That visits be made soon after the training-report meeting?during the first two weeks of the month if possible?even though the next training report meeting will not occur until the first Tuesday of the following month. President's Responsibility with Respect to Visiting Teaching As stated in the Relief Society Handbook, page 151, the General Board recommends that a portion of the time of the training-report meeting be utilized by the Relief Society president for suggestions and instructions to the visiting teachers and for discussion of special problems which arise in the teachers' work. However. This time has not always been used by Relief Society presidents. In some instances, the discussion of the visiting teachers' message has infringed upon the time of the president, and in other instances the president has failed to avail herself of the opportunity afforded. The responsibility of the visiting teachers' message leader ends with the discussion of the visiting teachers' message. She is in no other way connected with the regular activities of the visiting teachers who carry on their work under the direction of the ward presidency. She should always keep the discussion of the message within the allotted 10 to 15 minutes. (See suggestions on discussion of message. "Visiting Teachers' Message, Preview," 1944, p. 403.) The president, in turn, should take full advantage of the 10 minutes allotted her for the purposes specified. She will include notices or special messages to be given in the homes, such as announcements of regular Relief Society meetings, ward Relief Society conference, anniversary functions, and requests for information authorized to be collected by the teachers. The reports of the visiting teachers will often suggest to presidents matters which could profitably be discussed at the training-report meeting. When time permits, consideration might well be given to the duties of visiting teachers and related instructions, as found in the Visiting Teachers' Report Book, and as occasionally appear in bulletins from the General Board and in TheHistorical information relating to visiting teaching, as contained in A Centenary of Relief Society, might also be presented occasionally. The time allotted presidents at the training-report meeting provides opportunity to inspire and encourage the teachers, to broaden their vision of the work, and to foster a love for it. Visiting teachers should be encouraged to attend Relief Society and sacrament meetings regularly in order that they may adequately represent the Society. Presidents and other Relief Society executive officers should keep close to the work of the visiting teachers through a study of its history, a knowledge of the functions of the visiting teachers and familiarity with instructions to them, attendance at the training-report meetings, and through occasionally serving as an alternate visiting teacher. It is recommended that the president fully acquaint visiting teachers at the time of their appointment with the purposes of visiting teaching and with their duties and obligations as teachers. It is suggested that the counselor in charge of education discuss with the new visiting teacher the general subject matter of the messages for the year, and the purpose and importance of using these messages. Thus, the new teacher will approach her work with a better understanding of it, and a deeper appreciation for her calling as a visiting teacher. Distribution of Printed Messages Discouraged It has been a practice in some of the stakes for visiting teachers to distribute printed messages, whether or not they are related to the uni. Form messages provided by the General Board and published in the Magazine. The General Board discourages distribution of such messages, since they have a tendency to interfere with an oral discussion of the uniform messages in the homes and thus to defeat the purposes of these messages. (See "Visiting Teachers' Message, Preview,', p. 403.) This recommendation does not, of course, preclude distribution of announcement invitations relating to Relief Society meetings and other functions. "Notice of Visit" Slips Where visiting teachers call and find no one at home it is recommended that a slip be left indicating that the call has been made. "Notice of Visit" slips to be left by visiting teachers where no one ls found at home will be provided by NOTES TO THE FIELD the General Board, without charge, for use beginning in October. Visiting Teaching Requiring Automotive Transportation The recommendations of the General Board regarding visiting teaching requiring automotive transportation, included in Bulletin No. 24, February 19, 1942, and restated in The, p. 27, are here repeated with current revisions: 1. That visiting teaching be continued as usual where districts are within walking distance; 2. That where districts are scattered such districts be sub-divided, wherever practicable to do so, so that a smaller number of families may be visited by perhaps only one visiting teacher who lives in the neighborhood and is within walking distance of the families in such smaller districts; 3. That where distances make it impracticable for visits to be made, that a card might be sent by mail to unvisited families, or that such families might be called by telephone, where this service is available, but that such communications should not be counted as actual visits. Visiting in Pairs Under ordinary circumstances it is advisable for two visiting teachers to make visits together. The General Board, however, reaffirms the concession already. Mentioned regarding visits by one teacher where transportation is a problem, and also the following concession for the summer or vacation months, published in The, p. 758 and re- 515 stated in Bulletin No. 26, issued June 24, 1942: "Where desirable, it is suggested that each teacher might have one month free during the summer period, arrangements for which could be made by using substitute teachers, or by having teachers go singly for one or two months, as necessary." Duties of Visiting Teachers Although the visiting teachers' function of collecting donations for the Society will be discontinued as of October 1944, other duties will remain the same as_ heretofore; namely: 1. 'To visit L. D. S. Families monthly throughout entire year; 2. To discuss in the homes the message issued by the General Board for the months October through May (printed monthly in Thethree months in advance of month of presentation); 3. To discuss messages from the stake board, if issued for the summer months June through September; 4. To carry to or collect from the homes any special information required by the ward Relief Society officers; 5. To extend invitations to Relief Society meetings, giving information regarding the lessons and activities; 6. To make reports of visits as explained on pages 512-513.. To report confidentially to the president instances of need, illness or distress; 8. To report promptly to the president inability to make visits in a given month, so that an alternate may be appointed; 516 
8. To attend the visiting teachers' training-report meeting held monthly on the first Tuesday of the month, October through May;
9. To set an example for consistent attendance at all regular Relief Society meetings and at ward sacrament meetings;
10. To accept membership dues when offered by members, and to leave dues-collection envelopes with those members who have not already paid dues, such envelopes bearing names of members concerned, to be issued to visiting teachers by the ward Relief Society officers at a regular training-report meeting.
Visiting teachers, relieved of the responsibility of collecting contributions, are placed in the very desirable position of friendly visitors who carry uniform and official messages from the Society to the home, and who function primarily for the benefit of the home. Therefore, visiting teachers should approach their work with a spirit of enthusiasm and with a deep appreciation for the opportunity of coming in close personal relationship and neighborly communion with their sisters. The General Board recognizes and appreciates the devotion and service of the visiting teachers, and is confident that, during the coming year, their work of friendly visiting will receive renewed emphasis, accomplish the purposes for which it is designed and bring the satisfaction that accompanies success.
State Planning Meeting Recommended During September
As in 1942 and 1943, the General Board, with the approval of the General Authorities, again recommends that a stake planning meeting be held during the month of September, preliminary to the beginning of regular weekly meetings in October, for all stake board members, ward officers, and class leaders. It is recommended that, wherever feasible, this meeting be arranged in connection with a stake priesthood meeting or a stake quarterly conference in order to keep transportation at a minimum. The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate all phases of Relief Society work at the beginning of the 1944-45 season, to preview lesson work and other activities planned for the coming year, and to give whatever instructions and help are deemed necessary by the stake board. Stake Relief Society presidents will please acquaint their respective stake presidents with the recommendation that this special meeting be held, and arrange with them as to the most favorable date for calling the meeting. Stake Relief Society presidents are requested to send complete details of this meeting to all ward presidents as soon as possible so that good ward representation may be assured. The General Board feels sure that stake board members will make every effort to take full advantage of this special meeting and that they will be well prepared to conduct their respective departments for ward workers at this meeting. NOTES TO THE FIELD 517 Relief Society Union Meeting In Connection With Stake Quarterly Conferences During Fourth Quarter Of 1944 All stake Relief Societies desiring to do so may conduct a Relief Society stake and ward officers' (union) meeting in connection with the stake quarterly conference during the fourth quarter of this year, rather than to participate in the extra general session _ previously authorized. Announcement was made in the Magazine for April 1944, page 222, that for this year the Relief Society had been assigned the fourth quarter of the year, September 30 to December 10, 1944, for participation in the quarterly con-. Ference in those stakes where an extra conference session is planned. Since inception of this plan in 1942 the Relief Society was, in 1942 and 1943, assigned the summer quarter. For both these years the General Board issued a suggestive program for the use of those stakes where an additional conference session was held. After experience with this plan in 1942 and 1943, many stakes have reported that although the programs presented were well received the attendance at such an extra session of the conference has often been poor, due to the inability of stake members in outlying areas to either remain or return for an additional session. The General Board, with approval of the General Authorities, therefore authorizes a Relief Society union meeting to be held in connection with the quarterly conference in lieu of an extra general session of the conference. Stakes which prefer to participate in an extra general session, as heretofore, rather than to conduct a Relief Society union meeting, may do so, but will be expected to plan their own program. It is suggested that in many stakes a convenient time for such a union meeting would be simultaneously with the stake priesthood meeting. Other stakes may find it more convenient to meet between the forenoon and afternoon general sessions of the conference or immediately following the afternoon session. However, inasmuch as transportation is an important consideration in most stakes, the holding of such union meeting simultaneously with the stake priesthood meeting would seem to be the most feasible plan. The General Board appreciates the privilege of authorizing the holding of this union meeting which in most stakes will occur early in the 1944-45 season, and which will give valuable opportunity for supplementing the instructions and helps given at the preliminary stake planning meeting in September. Stake Relief Society presidents are urged to clear at once with their respective stake presidents as to the date of their quarterly conference during the fourth quarter, and as to plans for holding either a union meeting or an extra general session. Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 5, 1944 518 CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on Fast Sunday evenings, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 5, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual ward Relief Society conference. Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons and other work, near the beginning of the educational season. It is recommended: 1. That each ward conference be attended by a representative of the stake board who should be present at both the officers' meeting and the general session. 2. That each conference consist of two meetings? a. An officers' meeting to be attended by the ward executive officers, special workers and class leaders, the ward bishop or his representative, and the visiting stake board member, b. A general session for all Relief Society members and for the general membership of the ward. The purposes of the officers' meeting are to discuss special problems confronting the ward Relief Society, and to provide opportunity for the stake board member to evaluate the condition of the ward Society and to advise, instruct, and stimulate the ward officers. In order to accomplish the purposes of the meeting, some stakes prepare a questionnaire or present and discuss data from the last annual report. At least one hour should be allowed for this meeting and, in some instances, a longer period may be required. The time for holding the officers' meeting is optional with wards, but should be at a time convenient for the visiting stake board member and bishop. For example, this meeting may be held immediately preceding the general session, as heretofore suggested, the previous evening, or at some other time convenient for the bishop and visiting board member. This officers' meeting, held in connection with the ward conference, may constitute the monthly ward preparation meeting for the month in which the conference is held. In order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that advance announcement of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.. The following program for the general session is suggested by the General Board of Relief Society. Its use is optional, and stakes and wards desiring to plan their own programs may of course do so.

Hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him'' (Mormon 9:27).. Blessed is he... That is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.... For after much tribulation come the blessings" (Doc. & Cov. 58:2-4).. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, 'and he will console you in your afflictions" (Jacob 3:1). 12.

See also Gospel Doctrine, P- 443, paragraph 2; Gospel Standards, P- 183, paragraph 3- B. Growth Through Knowledge The Lord has said, "... treasure up in your minds continually the words of life" (Doc. & Gov. 84:85). The words of life are the everlasting gospel and the truths of this world. This is the knowledge that will last far beyond the grave and provide us with life everlasting, if we abide by the principles. Well might we ask with the Psalmist: "So teach us to number our days, "That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom" (Psalm 90:12). "The artist in living must never stop learning. You cannot coast through life on the momentum of a high school or even a college education. Life teaches us much, but we must learn and learn and learn. To stop, even for a moment, in the pursuit of knowledge is to bring mental death closer. "Never before has life been so eminently worth living, and never before so thrilling. The morning newspaper and the monthly magazine are veritable store-houses of challenges and stimuli. Never before have there been so many profoundly important causes crying for intelligent social cooperation." ? Wolfe, W. Reran. "Don't Wait to Live," The Reader's Digest, June 1944. See also Doc. & Gov. Sec. 130:19; Sec. 131:6. C. Satisfaction Through Service "To find happiness we must seek for it 521 in a focus outside ourselves. If you live only for yourself you are always in immediate danger of being bored to death with the repetition of your own views and interests?Choose a movement that represents a distinct trend toward greater hu-man happiness and align yourself with it. No one has learned the meaning of living until he has surrendered his ego to the service of his fellowmen." ? Ibid. The need to serve was never greater than at the present time. Women need to find a "focus outside themselves," to forget their own anxieties and fears, A new understanding and recognition of neighborliness needs to prevail in our communities. All need to look around and rediscover again the value of offering themselves for the good of others. The kindly visit, the thoughtful deed, the needed praise to the timid ? these are the things for which all hunger. Through such things women find satisfaction and happiness in life.

Monthly Preparation Meeting For Ward Relief Society Officers A MONTHLY preparation meeting for ward Relief Society officers, special workers, and class leaders was recommended by the General Board in Bulletin 24, dated February 19, 1942. Subsequent reports have indicated that these meetings have not yet become well established in m any wards, and therefore the following suggestions are issued by the General Board as a means of emphasizing the importance of this meeting and aiding ward Relief Society officers in the conduct of such meetings. Purpose of Preparation Meeting The purpose of this meeting is to give ward Relief Society officers an opportunity to present for the information and consideration of the group any messages and instructions received from the stake board or the General Board, and any plans or problems of the ward officers relating to the ward Relief Society which may properly come before such a meeting. Such a ward preparation meeting, attended by all officers, special workers, and class leaders promotes a spirit of co-operation and a feeling of joint responsibility for the success of the ward Relief Society; it creates general understanding and support of all workers for the Relief Society program as a whole, and for the special assignment of each individual worker. Frequency of Meeting It is suggested that the monthly preparation meeting be held during the period September through April and dispensed with during the months May through August, unless special business makes it advisable to call one or more meetings during the summer. It is also suggested 522 that the officers' meeting, held in connection with the annual ward Relief Society conference, may serve as the monthly preparation meeting for the month in which the conference is held. This year the ward conferences are scheduled to be held in November. Time of Preparation Meeting The ward preparation meeting should be held at whatever time is most convenient for the greatest number concerned. In some wards, where transportation is a problem, the meeting may most conveniently be held either before or after a regular Relief Society meeting, but in such situations sufficient time should be allowed to accomplish the purposes of the meeting. A hurried atmosphere is not conducive to free discussion of problems. Some wards incorporate a social atmosphere into the meeting which helps to stimulate attendance and to develop a desirable spirit of comradeship among the workers. In those wards where the bishop calls a monthly meeting of bishopric and ward officers (See Church Handbook of Instructions No. 17, issued 1944, Page 54), and where opportunity ls provided for auxiliary department work, the department for Relief Society workers then becomes a monthly preparation meeting. Planning for a Preparation Meeting Good planning, in advance, by the executive officers is essential to the conduct of a successful ward preparation meeting. The executive officers should have material ready for presentation and discussion at the meeting, and should be aware of some of the problems confronting the Society and the special workers and class leaders in their particular assignments, and should raise these problems for consideration, as well as giving all workers in attendance an opportunity to present their problems. Attendance All ward executive officers, special workers, and class leaders are expected to be in attendance at the monthly preparation meeting. It is recommended that stake board members attend ward preparation meetings where possible, but that not more than one or two board members should visit the same ward at the same time. In order to make this possible, stake officers should ascertain the day and time of this meeting from all wards of the stake, and ward officers should keep the stake officers informed of any change of schedule. Board members should then be assigned by the stake officers to attend ward preparation meetings as convenient to do so. Stake board members in attendance at ward preparation meetings may often be able to give suggestions and help with respect to problems raised, and may often become more aware of the problems and specific needs in a ward, as they are brought out at such a meeting, than could be derived in any other way. Problems which need further consideration may be referred by the stake board member to the stake board at its next regular stake board meeting. 'The stake board can then send any Specific help or suggestions needed. In some instances the stake board may not have a specific policy or may not have the necessary information on problems presented and may, as NOTES TO THE FIELD necessary, call on the General Board for help. Where stake board members are not in attendance at a ward preparation meeting and problems arise requiring consideration of the stake board, such matters should be referred promptly to the stake board 523 by mail or telephone. The ward record book contains space on Page 3 for recording attendance at ward preparation meetings, and minutes of these meetings should be record. Ed on the blank pages provided in the record book. Suggestive Subjects for Consideration at Preparation Meeting Following is a suggestive list of subjects for consideration at ward preparation meetings: 1. Read and thoroughly discuss an from the stake board or General y instructions and suggestions received Board since the preceding preparation meeting, so that each worker will understand her responsibility in relation to any new assignments or instructions, 2. Discuss plans for any special meetings, activities or projects to be initiated or conducted during the ensuing month, such as the annual ward Relief Society conference, sewing assignment from the stake welfare committee, Magazine subscription campaign, collection of annual dues, plans for an anniversary party, etc. 3. Consider organization problems presented by the various members of the group relating to their specific assignment or to the general problems, such as textbooks, class participation of members, and attendance, for consideration of the group, but they should not review lessons to be presented at coming Relief Society meetings as all offices present at the preparation meeting will hear the complete lesson presentation in the regular meeting for all members. 4. Consider the selection of songs to correlate with the lessons for the meetings to be held during the ensuing month. ? 5. Call for pertinent, concise reports from members of the group who have attended other meetings related to the work of the local Society; for example, officers who have attended any meetings with stake officers since the previous preparation meeting, or meetings of the executive officers with the ward bishopric. Whenever stake union meetings are held, opportunity should be given each member of the group  to report briefly the instructions and information received at her respective department of the union meeting, so that all ward officers and 10. Class leaders may be informed with respect to instructions given in all departments of the union meeting as well as in the one department attended by each officer. Appoint for ensuing month hospitality committee to serve in welcoming members at regular ward Relief Society meetings in those wards where such special committees are desired. (See Bulletin 27, issued September 3, 1942.) Occasionally review previous bulletins and instructions which still have current value; for example, the suggestions on maintaining and increasing attendance contained in Bulletin 27 which might well be reviewed at the beginning of each season's work. Review, at least once a year, instructions and forms in the ward record book and Visiting Teachers' Report Book, so that all workers will be familiar with the record made of the work for which they are responsible, and so that those who have responsibility for reporting certain data may be acquainted with necessary details. Once a year present analysis of the ward's latest annual report so that the entire group of workers may be encouraged by their accomplishments and may be informed as to those aspects of the work which need to be strengthened. This report should be presented by the secretary, who will select, analyze, and interpret pertinent data, making comparisons with other information and with figures from the preceding year, where necessary or advisable, in order to measure growth or decline. Occasionally review historical information pertinent to current programs or problems as found in A Centenary of Relief Society; for example, reference to previous courses of study which could supplement current courses, history of sewing in the Relief Society, et cetera. Magazine Binders Again Available The General Board is pleased to announce that binders into which twelve single copies of Thebe inserted or removed at will, are once more available. The new binders are similar to those NOTES TO THE FIELD formerly distributed through the General Board-substantial, well-made, blue covers with the titlestamped in gold. 525 These binders are a great convenience to all stake and ward Relief Society officers, to class leaders, and to all Magazine subscribers who like to keep a current year's issue of the Magazine together. The General Board is offering the binders to Magazine subscribers at a cost price of $1.20 postpaid.

Relief Society War Bonds So Be Deposited With General Board THE annual reports for 1942 and 1943 indicate that stake and ward Relief Societies have purchased war bonds totaling approximately $45,000. Inasmuch as most Relief Societies will be reorganized once or more before these bonds mature and inasmuch as few Relief Societies have their own safety deposit boxes, it is recommended that these bonds be deposited in the office of the General Board for safekeeping. No charge will be made for this service. Bonds mailed to the General Board for safekeeping should be sent by registered mail. A receipt will be issued for each bond received, showing the name of the stake or ward Relief Society to which it was issued, the date of issue, the series, the bond serial number, the face value of the bond, and date of maturity. As the bonds mature, they will be returned by registered mail to the respective Relief Societies which own them. A Relief Society wishing to cash a bond before maturity may procure its bond at any time, upon request, accompanied by the receipt of deposit issued by this office. Bulletin No. 24, issued February 19, 1942, to all stake, ward, and mission Relief Society presidents, pointed out, on page 13, that Series E bonds are for issue only to individuals, that any bonds purchased from Relief Society funds should be either of Series F or G, and should be in the name of the Society, not in the name of an individual. Instances have since come to our attention of the purchase of Series E bonds from Relief Society funds, issued necessarily in the name of an individual. Relief Societies which have purchased Series E bonds are advised to turn in these bonds at once and have them replaced by bonds in Series F or G, issued in the name of the stake or ward Relief Society. The General Board will accept no Series E bonds for deposit.  Suggestive Quilting Prices QUILT-MAKING is both traditional and extensive in Relief Society, as indicated in the 1943 annual report (Magazine for July 1944, p. 70), and thousands of quilts are made annually for various purposes. Relief Society women give willingly of their time in quilting for the needy and for co-operative help-one-another projects. They are also given opportunity to earn funds for their local Relief Societies by making quilts for sale at bazaars, and for the accommodation of individuals who order from the Society either complete quilts or the service of quilting. Obviously, Relief Society members should not be expected to give service on such custom quilting at rates which yield too little income for their respective Societies in proportion to the quilt-making service. In response to numerous requests for suggestive prices for custom quilting, the General Board submits the following: Tied quilts $2.00 to $3.00 Plain quilts of simple pattern, large design or straight lines $4.00 to $5.00 Pieced or appliqued quilts, and quilts of one material, such as rayon, with decorative quilting.............. $6.00 to $12.00 Quilts of extremely intricate design with very close quilting, $12 and up A few popular pieced and appliqued quilt patterns, and designs for quilting, are shown in the accompanying illustrations, and may be helpful to Relief Society women. 527 Forward, Without Fear Dorothy Clapp Robinson SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTER ONE One hundred years ago the River Maid, up from New Orleans, disgorged her passengers at a newly constructed wharf on the west bank of the Mississippi a few miles up the river from Montrose, Iowa. The passengers were converts from England but there were four Norwegians? Ann Kristin Mortensen viewed the land of Zion with mingled joy and sorrow. Sorrow because both parents had been buried along the way, joy because now, she thought, all her troubles were at an end. Her sister Helga Mortensen insisted Kristin watch the trunk which contained their money while she helped Niels and Johanna Hansen, to the camp prepared for them a quarter mile up the river. Edward Lewis, a missionary assigned to conduct the immigrants safely up the river to the settlements. His son, Matt Lewis, sees Ann Kristin on the wharf and is strongly attracted to her. Later to his mother he calls her an "over-decorated female." He took a hearty dislike to her fiance Thomas Bedloe, who with Patty Lou Turner and Jake NICHOLS, a non-convert, joined the company at St. Louis. Bedloe secured a wagon to haul the Mortensen girls' trunks to camp. He wanted Kristin to cross the river to Nauvoo that night but she thinks her duty for a day or two lies with the less fortunate immigrants. CHAPTER TWO HELGA was just starting back to the wharf when Ann Kristin entered the clearing. "Where are the trunks?" asked in alarm. Page 528  "Tom Bedloe is bringing them. Don't fret about it and, please, do not stare at me that way. They are safe with him." "I am not sure. I do not entirely trust him." "Helga, how can you say such a thing of the man I am to marry?" "Forgive me, Aeskling. It is just that I am so anxious over the money. "But it is safe, Helga. No one knows it is in the trunk." Helga hesitated. She was still displeased but there was nothing she could do about it. One of the women called for them to come and eat. They went to the table, but Ann Kristin would not eat. She would wait for Tom Bedloe. The table was spread with white cloths; but the dishes had quite evidently been gathered here and there. There was not enough cutlery to go around and some of the immigrants went to their bags for some. The food was coarse but wholesome. It was a banquet to most of these people, tired and hungry from their long trip. When the first edge of their appetites had been dulled, tongues were loosed and the buzz of conversation increased in volume and tempo. All were thankful to be here at last. All were anxious to know conditions, the price of labor, the price of land, etc. But the question most often repeated was about the Prophet, how was he, where was he, how soon could they see him? Would it be presumptuous to call on him at his home? FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR "You can't see him now at all," Mrs. Mason, one of the serving women answered. "He is in jail, in Carthage. Young Matt Lewis who belongs to the Nauvoo Legion just came across to see his father. He says the brethren are looking for more trouble. Have some meat, Mrs. Hansen. You look like you could do with some. We may not have meat again for months." Where could they find houses, was on' every tongue. Some of the men had tents and were going to pitch them. Some wanted to know to whom the land belonged. "It belongs to Elder Lewis," Mrs. Mason answered. "He pre-empted it or bought it, I don't know which. Anyway, he will let you build shelters here or pitch your tents, and you had better do it for it is going to rain." Helga translated for Niels, and he grew more and more excited. "Such trees. Such soil. It will grow anything. We shall never be hungry in this country, my Johanna. I will build a cabin for us." "My, how he jabbers." Mrs. Mason looked admiringly at Niels. "I don't see how he ever learned it. There is another Swede or two in camp. They came from Minnesota." When that was translated to him Niels swallowed the remainder of his meal in short order. Bedloe came with the trunks, protesting as he unloaded them. He would not wait to eat but went back with the dray. He promised Ann Kristin to see her later. Patty Lou Turner made friends with everyone, but stayed close to Helga. Jake refused to eat because he was not a Mormon. 529 "I'm leaving directly," he told the women. "I came along with Patty Lou. It wouldn't do to let her come alone. She is too scatterbrained. Want to walk back to the river with me, Honey?" Hesitating long enough to let him know she wasn't concerned about his going, Patty Lou followed him down the trail a short way. "Honey," Jake turned to her, "I know you-all don't care nothing about me, but if you ever need me send word." "Why should I be needing you all?" she demanded. "That's what my papa said, when I get tired of my new Church and need him, I can go back. Well, I am not going back to either one of you, Jake Nichols." Acute pain flitted across the man's face. "Your papa give you money?" She nodded. His heavy boot dug into the soft earth. "They say as there's money to be made freighting between here and the western forts. I?ll be getting word to you. Sure you-all got enough money?" When she did not answer he went on, "If I don't get out directly, I'll see you again." As he strode off toward the wharf the girl's face twisted. He was her last link with home. She felt in her pocket. If he only knew how empty it was. As Patty Lou left, Helga turned to her sister. "Let us get some money from the trunk and put in our purse. Tomorrow we will go to a bank. There are some gold pieces." "Tomorrow we move to a hotel in Nauvoo," Ann Kristin answered positively. She turned to go. Just then a little girl screeching in fun ran past. To avoid her, Ann Kristin 530 whirled and stopped the headlong flight of two pursuers. The three rolled over and over in a tangle of skirts and legs. Scrambling hurriedly to her feet, Ann Kristin found herself facing Matt Lewis. He was doubled over with laughter. Ann Kristin bit her lip to still its trembling. "Forgive me." Matt stepped close. "You have hurt your hand." "Tt is nothing?just a sliver." The women crowded about her but Matt took her hand. He held it palm up. Blood was running through her fingers. A jagged sliver had gone through the flesh between her thumb and forefinger. "That's nasty," Mrs. Mason said, "Tt will fester and make your whole arm sore. You'd better get it out." It was more than a sliver. A very small twig had gone through and broken off. Matt's glance went from the wound to the girl's face. "T can get it out with my knife. Can you stand it?" She nodded, not trusting herself to speak." She concentrated on Matt's hands. They were brown and lean like his body, but sure and steady, and his touch was gentle. When, at last, he got the sliver between his knife blade and thumbnail, he gave a quick jerk. It did not come away clean. Matt probed but there was nothing more he could remove. Mrs. Lewis came with turpentine and clean cloth for bandages. "Hold her hand steady, Matthew, while I pour turpentine in the wound." "She is going to faint." Matt's arm had already gone around her. He eased her to a bench by the table. "Didn't I see you at the wharf?" he asked later. "For a moment." Remembering his "over-decorated female" she turned her eyes to the cloth his mother was tying around her hand. When she raised them he was still watching. "You speak English so?so well." So that was the reason for his staring. She spoke shortly. "Helga and I were taught English by our schoolmaster; and it is two years since we left Norway." "Your accent is?it makes you? that is?." He became suddenly aware of the women's attention. "Why don't you-all say it?" Patty Lou had come back. "Say it makes her more charming. That, is what Tom Bedloe says." "Who is Tom Bedloe?" Lewis asked. "He is the Wonder Man of the Ages. We-all come down the Ohio together, and joined this company at St. Louis. He is going to marry Kris." Without a word Matt walked away to join some men he could see though the trees. Anxious to get away from the solicitous women, Ann Kristin walked back and sat down on one of their trunks. Helga joined her a few minutes later. Patty Lou's trunk had been placed by theirs. Mrs. HELGA took a purse from the pocket of her skirt, and from it took a ring of keys. She went to the smallest trunk and unlocked it. Meanwhile Ann Kristin had undone the leather straps with her one hand. "T have never worried so much in my life as IT have since father gave me the key to this metal box," Helga FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR confided. "We must get this money into a bank at Nauvoo tomorrow." "It seems unfair for us to have so much when all these people have so little.' Ann Kristin was really thinking of all she could do with the small fortune in banknotes and gold that was in the metal box. She had never known hardships and she wanted to get away from here quickly. "We are alone now," Helga reminded her. "We must invest our money very carefully." She threw up the lid. A soft woolen blanket was spread neatly over the contents of the trunk. Standing so their bodies screened it from anyone who might be watching, Helga lifted the blanket and ran her hands into the center of the trunk. "What is it?" Ann Kristin demanded as her sister began to feel about frantically. "Kristie. It's gone. Our money box is gone." "Don't get excited. It must be there. You have had the key all the ?" "It is gone. I tell you, it is gone." Indifferent now of any who might see, Helga began snatching at - the contents?not knowing nor caring where they fell. The last article was lifted from the trunk, but there was no metal box. "It was this trunk, wasn't it?" Kristin asked, hoping desperately. "Certainly it was. When father gave it to us we put it here?in this trunk." "Let's look in the bags?and the other trunks." It was not in their bags, nor in the other trunks. The two wooden chests were bound with 531 strong ropes. 'They had not been opened since being sealed in Norway. Only a man could open them. "Could we have left it in New Orleans, or on the River Maid?" Helga's fear made her cross. "Don't be foolish. You know it was this trunk." "But it can't be lost. That was all father's money, and the money he got for our home and his business. Why?without it we?would be poor." A faintness made Kristin sit down abruptly. "If we had gone to a hotel in Nauvoo we would not have been able to pay." Helga flinched as if a lash had struck her. "Yes, we shall be as poor as?as Niels or?." "What is it? What is the matter?" They turned. Elder Lewis and Niels were by them. "Why have you unpacked in such fashion?" Niels asked. Too stunned to remember English, Helga answered. In short, disjointed sentences, she told about the money and its disappearance. "How could you have been so careless? If you had told me I would have watched it day and night." Edward Lewis, pale and wasted by fever stood listening. He _ understood a few words of Norwegian. "What have you lost?" he asked, abruptly. They told him, and then for his satisfaction they went through the bags and trunks again. It just could not be lost, but it was. Edward Lewis dropped wearily onto one of the boxes. "It was to prevent this type of thing that I went to New Orleans. Our people have lost so much." 532 They had been so absorbed they had not heard a team approach, but suddenly Thomas Bedloe was there, too. "What is going on?" he asked Ann Kristin. Then noticing her bandaged hand he cried out, "What happened? How did you get hurt?" Then Niels and Elder Lewis noticed the bandages. She explained briefly. Again she told about their loss. Bedloe asked question after question. He refused to believe it was gone. No. No one had handled the keys.. They had been pinned to Helga's clothes day and night. The trunk had been in their cabin on board the River Maid. They had insisted on that. Helga had been in the trunk once after leaving St. Louis to get a blanket for Mrs. Jacobson's baby. She did not actually handle the box then, but she was sure it was there. She could give no reason why she was sure. So, actually, neither one had seen it since locking the trunk at New Orleans. They had had money enough to finish the journey. "How many people knew you had it?" Startled, they all turned. Matt Lewis was standing back of the largest chest. "Who knew you had it?" he asked again. "Just Helga and I." "I knew it," Elder Lewis said. "Helga told me night before last after our testimony meeting. She was worried about getting it to a bank." Ann Kristin's eyes widened. She looked at Helga and then to Matt. "That makes three," he said flatly, "Who else?" "T don't know that you have any tight to ask such a question." Bedloe was plainly annoyed with Matt. Ignoring him, Matt still watched Ann Kristin. Something about his eyes, looking so coldly, so mercilessly at her, brought a quick flush to the girl's cheeks. She thought, some one we know took it, one of our own group must have taken it. Misunderstanding her blush, Matt's voice softened. "I'm sorry," he apologized. "I did not mean to be rude. I am trying to help. Who brought them. Up from the wharf?" "Absurd," Bedloe spoke quickly. "They were not out of my sight. You are way off if you suspect the drayman. You will have to look in a different direction for the thief. It would have to have been taken before the boat docked." "Just why are you so sure?" "I have told you. I was with the trunks until they were unloaded here." He looked around. "Have they been left alone here?" Helga shook her head. "We haven't been out of sight of them." Just then Patty Lou came rushing toward them. "Girls, guess what Sister Lewis has. I never saw one before?." She stopped short. ""What ?what is it? Is your hand worse? You all look fit for burying." Ann Kristin's hand was throbbing with pain. She wanted to go someplace where she could rest and clean up. She made no effort to answer. "Their money is gone," Matt told her. Patty Lou's curiosity mounted swiftly. She did not seem surprised. She looked at Bedloe, at the open trunks, and back to Bedloe. "Are you still going to marry her?" "What's that got to do with it?" he demanded harshly. FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR "So you-all lost your money? Marvelous. Mine has been gone since shortly after we left St. Louis. Elder Lewis only had seven dollars when he left to go to New Orleans. His wife told me. So now we are all in the same stewing kettle." There was a note in her voice none of them had heard before. "If you are trying to joke," Tom Bedloe said crisply, "you are not succeeding very well. 'This is a serious business. It is unbelievable that this could happen in this group, but I am going to find the thief, let the chips fall where they may." "So shall I," Matt's voice was cold and hard. "Don't worry yourself into a lather about it," Patty Lou cautioned. "Skunks will steal into the best watched henhouses. Especially," she added, "if they are hungry skunks." "That's it," Matt's voice held a note of triumph. "Who among the group has been spending money?" Patty Lou stared unabashed at Bedloe. "I recollect you-all said your money was gone when we took contributions for the Jacobson family. Now look at the handsome rig you-all's hired or bought." Bedloe stiffened. "You didn't think I would give my last cent did you?" "Do tell," the girl cooed. "Silence." ' Edward Lewis' eyes flashed with anger. "I will not have you accuse each other. Some one who had keys got into your room unnoticed. I will see Captain Russell at once, and I will interview the immigrants. There was a trader on board?." | "He left the boat with you _ this morning," Bedloe said quickly. * 533 "Just why either one of you left I don't know, but I will find him." Matt stepped toward him. "I don't like the way you said that." Before Bedloe could answer, Mrs. Lewis joined them. Her face was radiant. In one hand she carried a kerosene lamp. 'The bowl and reflector were of shining tin, and the glass chimney had a crinkled flare. It was a kitchen lamp, and very inexpensive by later standards. At that time it was a luxury. | "You walked so fast I could not keep up with you, Patty Lou. Oh?" she stopped short when she saw the men. "I didn't know you were still here, Matthew. I wanted to show the girls my new lamp. Pa bought it for me. Wasn't that thoughtful of him when he had such a little money?" A dead silence fell over the group. They avoided each other's eyes. Then Matt stepped quickly to his mother's side. He put an arm over her shoulders. "It is lovely, Mother, and little enough recompense for the months you spend alone." He glared at the group, but Patty Lou ignored his threat. "I reckon a new-fangled gadget like that would have to come from New Orleans, or St. Louis." "I am sure it didn't," Sister Lewis answered innocently. "Pa would never spend that much money so far from home. Would you, Brother Lewis?" "No, Matilda. I bought it this morning in Montrose." He made no other explanation. Each was free to think his own thoughts and all were thinking the same. (To be continued)
