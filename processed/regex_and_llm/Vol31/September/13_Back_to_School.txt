Back to School THE month of September is ''back to school" month. How grateful we should be that, even though
our nation is at war, its school doors will be opened as usual and the nation's children will be offered opportunities for scholastic training similar to those afforded in normal times. Our schools, like all other institutions, have felt the impact of the war, but they have managed to
maintain a normal school year, a capable teaching staff, and have offered standard courses of study? in some instances, even accelerated educational programs. Education has traditionally been viewed with veneration by the American public. The development of our school system and the support given our schools on the elementary, secondary, and college levels by hundreds
of thousands of Americans, attest the faith of the people of this nation in the power of the  schools to be of benefit to them. One of the unfortunate effects of the war has been the  interruption in the school training of many of our boys and girls. Some of this has been unavoidable, but, in too many instances, it as been due to our youth and their parents failing to take a long-range view of the importance of scholastic training, and to their yielding to the pressures and inducements of wartime. According to the Page 508 Children's Bureau, thousands of children under fourteen years of age, for whom there is no official count, are known to have left school to work, while high school enrollment has dropped one million during the war and is becoming progressively more serious. The availability of jobs many of which do not contribute
directly to the war effort or to the development of the worker? accompanied by high wages has been the magnet which has drawn great numbers of our boys and girls from the school room, many of whom are working in violation of child labor and compulsory school-attendance
laws, many teen-age boys and girls are children of the depression. They and their parents remember when jobs were hard to get, and they are fearful of a lack of jobs when the war
is over. They feel they had better work while jobs are plentiful and that school can wait. Others believe it is a patriotic duty to leave school and go to work, while still others, impressed with the accent given the war and its related activities, have lost sight of, or have even come to
doubt, the importance of regular school attendance. Latter-day Saints believe in education
and the great opportunities for development and advancement afforded by the schools, and they encourage school attendance. It is realized that economic need and defense labor needs may require some boys and girls to work during the coming year, and that for some young people work experience may have significant education value. It is also realized that for many young people scholastic training beyond the secondary schools may not be desirable or possible. Nevertheless, the vast majority of our youth should be in school.
Parents are urged to take a long range view of the needs of their children. All the education and training they can get will be needed to fit them for the postwar world. Their future welfare and the strength of the nation are in large measure bound up with the wise use of school opportunities. If our children are to be equipped for tomorrow, they should go to school today.
