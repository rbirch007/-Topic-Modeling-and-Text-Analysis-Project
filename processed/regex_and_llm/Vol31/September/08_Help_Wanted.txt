Help Wanted Nora Wayne, ELLEN stood on the crowded bus, one hand clutching the back of a seat, and swayed with its lurchings. Her mind was Performing its usual five-o'clock treadmill. How Many potatoes were left from dinner last night? If there should be enough to cream she could open a can of salmon and dinner would be easy, No, she had used the last of the salmon a week ago. There hadn't been any in the shops for a long time now. What could she fix? Since the meat shortage it had been hard to think up quick meals. She'd have to wait until she got home and see what there was on hand. They'd have to get along on what she could find, she was just too utterly weary to shop tonight. She Supposed she wasn't 4 good manager. Maybe she wouldn't get so tired if she didn't do all her work twice, once thinking of it and dreading it, and once when she did it. If Gil were only more CO-operative. But he didn't want her to ? work, The crowd and Ellen sank exhausted into a seat. She couldn't understand why that day her boss had said, "What we'd do without you, Mrs. Jones, it Scares me to think. You are so quick and so accurate." But Gil Said. "Mothers are needed in the home." If he did his part and backed her up with the children, everyone could Carty more of the household load and she could go on working easily. But Gil believed that even in war a home should be a Sanctuary where the beauties of life were treasured. Beauties! There were no beauties on the battle fields. Was there any reason why every one should not suffer and sacrifice? Her corner at last! She wondered if she would have the energy to climb the two blocks uphill. Nights it seemed more like How good the house looked, messy as it was after Joan' Paper, but Gil would be home and she must get dinner started. If only he wouldn't talk about her work to. She would try hard to be pleasant and attractive, and maybe he wouldn't think about it. Twelve-year-old David and Joan were in the kitchen and had the table set. "Good children," she cy were sweet, really, and did their best to help out. Ellen found a glass of chipped beef and a can of milk. There were a few greens in the ice box and she tossed a salad and made some toast for the creamed chipped beef. As she buttered the bread she heard Gil come in. "Dinner asked. "It's so much less effort to clear up after," she said pleasantly. Page 495 smiled. In the kitchen?" he 496 '"My idea of a rich man is one who eats dinner in the dining room every night." Gil said. Oh dear, he was going to be difficult. Of course, she could serve dinner in the dining room and have flowers on the table and fresh napkins every day when that was all she did. "Find Tommy," she said to Joan, "and wash his hands. Dinner's all ready." Ellen smiled at Gil as they all sat down at the table. "Tell me about your day," she said. "Nothing to tell," he answered grumpily. All right, if he was going to be like that, let him. She wasn't going to put forth all the effort. The meal was finished in silence. As she washed the dishes the phone rang?Sister Handley wanting her to give a lesson in Relief Society. Would they never remember that she worked? Ellen wondered why they tried to hold Relief Society with all the women so busy doing war work. What place did peacetime organizations have in a war-torn world? She wasn't as careful in wording her refusal as she should have been. As she hung up the phone, Tommy came into the kitchen. "Why aren't you in bed?" she cried. "Do I even have to put you to bed? It seems to me that a big boy of seven could do a few things himself." Tommy looked at her reproachfully. "I was only going to tell you about my war work," he said. "Some other time," she answered impatiently. "Now hurry, and get through the tub and hop into bed." Tommy saw no relenting in her set lips and tramped sullenly upstairs. A night or two later Ellen sat alone in the living room. Gil was out and she was just too weary to go upstairs to bed. She had finished the ironing and sat with some mending on her lap. The pile was huge. It did seem that the children's clothes wore out fast, and the household linen was all going to pieces. She never got all the way to the bottom of the pile any more. She wondered where Gil was. When he saw her get out the ironing board, he had put on his hat and gone out. It was like this often now. She worked alone until far into the night. There were so many things Gil could help her with if he would. He was just trying to make it hard for her. It did something to a man's pride. Her mother had said, for his wife to work. She had tried so hard to get Ellen not to take work outside her home, but that was silly and old-fashioned. Besides, Gil knew she didn't work for the money. She was sincerely patriotic and worked because she thought it her duty. She was an excellent secretary and there was need for everyone who could use a typewriter. Oh well, maybe some day he would see it., She rose wearily to go upstairs just as Gil came into the room. "Tt's about time you got home," she said hotly. "Besides all that ironing, I had Tommy's bath to supervise and then had to help Joan with her arithmetic. You don't do anything around here any more." "After all I have my business," he answered. "It's a pretty big thing to keep it going with priorities of men and material." He did look tired and thinner HELP WANTED than he had, but so was Ellen tired. "It wouldn't hurt you to take a little of the responsibility," she flung, "You do the Physical things," he retorted, "and I don't say they aren't important. But what do you really know about any of our lives? Or what do you care?" A cold hand clutched her throat, What did she know about their lives? Where had Ci been tonight and where had he been three nights last week? She would cry if she spoke, she prepared for bed in silence. Longing to put her arm around him and snuggle her head in his shoulder, she lay stiffly on her side of the bed un. Quarrel was not patched up in the morning, and for days they lived in a sort of armed truce, The children watched them for any sign of the old gay family spirit, and went about dejectedly, fearful. ONE night at dinner Gil sniffed inquiringly, and asked, "Is there gas leaking?" "I do smell something," Ellen said. "I hadn't noticed it before," and she got up to check the gas cocks, "Maybe it's me," David said. ?I stumbled over all those old papers Tommy has in my work room and knocked over a bottle of the gasoline for my airplane engines. It broke all over everything." Gil and Ellen looked at each other and started for the basement, the children at their heels. Gasoline and old paper! What a combination. "What on earth!" Gil "Wherever did you get so said, many 497 Papers?" He turned to Ellen, "What were you thinking of to let him pile up Papers like that in 4 work room? Gasoline and sparks from the electrical equipment! Either one could burn the place down." He continued to Mutter as he stacked papers and carried them outside. "I tried to tell you," Tommy said, "It's my war work. Every day I took my wagon around the neighborhood and gathered the Papers. The government needs paper, The Toom was getting pretty full and I Was going to ask you who to get to catty them away." "So that is what he does the time he is alone," Gil said. - "Wanders the streets with his wagon, going into every one's house, and carrying Out goodness knows what with the Papers. Bob Mercer said he saw him down on Vine street the other day, but I thought Bob just didn't know the kid. Did you go clear down on Vine Street?" Gil asked. "Well, sometimes I went pretty far," Tommy admitted. Ellen felt terribly shocked. She had talked so much about patriotism. She had tried to impress on him how every one should do his share, but she hadn't made him see that his share was staying at home and keeping out of mischief. He had wanted to do something more, some. Thing that showed up as part of the war effort. "There, I guess that will do for tonight," Gil said. "Tomorrow I?ll call the Salvation Army or the Volunteers of America and ask them to pick it up. I?ll bring home some heavy string and we'll put it all in bundles tomorrow night. We'll all 498 have to work at it. You'll have to hand it to the kid. He certainly did a thorough job. He must have five hundred pounds here." Finally, the ruined dinner was eat. En and 'Tommy in bed, and the older children at their books. Gil and Ellen sat on either side of the fireplace, each with a part of the paper. She had felt too shaken to do any more work.. Gil pulled something out of his pocket. "I think you should see this Ellen," he said, handing her a typewritten slip. Regret to inform you... Teeth in bad repair... Seems nervous > Appears to be caused by malnutrition... Suggest you see a doctor. "Not David, surely? David has always been so well," she said, her eyes questioning Gil. "It was in the mailbox when I got home," he said. "How long has it been since he has been to the dentist?"' "Why, only a few weeks," she said. But had it been only a few weeks? Time had a way of slipping by when one was so busy. She began to go back in her mind. It was when her mother was here, just before she started to work. Why, it had been more than a year! Just as she began to say that she would call] the dentist the next day, the doorbell tang, and Gil went into the hall. He came back with the Stones from next door, and Ellen was busy for a few minutes making them comfortable. "Sometimes I get so nervous reading about the war and listening to it on the radio | just have to get away for a few minutes," Ruth Stone said. You can't get away from the war, Ellen thought. It is just here and it is better to face it. But Ruth was such a silly little thing. It probably wouldn't do her much good to face it. There wouldn't be much she could do about it. "Ruth doesn't like to talk about the war," Jack said, "but in her own quiet way she is doing a swell job of licking it." Ruth was? Ellen looked a little startled. "What are you doing, Ruth?" she asked. Ruth giggled. "You know me," she said, "the proverbial dumb Dora. There isn't a thing I can do." "No?" Jack said. "Well, tonight we had the quarterly weighing and measuring of the small fry and, do you know, in the last three months they have gained more in weight and height than any previous three months since they were infants? If that isn't something in these days of food shortages I'd like to know what is. Four good husky specimens to take over for Uncle Sam when their time comes." Ellen felt Gil's eyes on her, but she looked at her hands folded in her lap. "That's nothing," Ruth said. "It's kind of funny when you think of it. I was worried about all these short. Ages and then Sister Handley came to see me. She said she'd heard I'd majored in foods in college, and wouldn't I share my knowledge with the Relief Society? She gives me a few minutes each meeting. I had to have something to tell them and have I worked? But I took my own advice and it works. There are things you can do that the children don't notice, and they don't realize they aren't getting the things they are used to."
The evening passed in a sort of daze. Too much had happened to Ellen. She couldn't think straight. The next morning she phoned the office that she wouldn't be in until noon. She had to make a dental appointment for David and one with the doctor. There were the things she should have done last night, and a lot of other odds and ends. She'd have to take a half day.
"Are you going to be home all day?" Joan asked.
"Only until noon," Ellen answered, and saw a flash of something like relief cross Joan's face as she dashed out the door on her way to school. Why should Joan be relieved that her mother would not be home all day? Ellen thought about it fleetingly and then was caught up in things to do.
She might as well send Gil's suit to the cleaner. As she emptied the pockets she noticed several sheets of paper covered with notes, and wondered if it were something he would want to keep. She glanced at the top sheet.
"Help wanted," it said.
That couldn't be important. Probably he was drafting an ad to run for help at the foundry. Goodness knows they were having a hard enough time getting people to do the work, with Government contracts and all. She was just about to wad up the sheet when her eye was caught by the next words, "To give personal service in a motherless home. An older woman satisfactory. Must be able to sew on buttons, have house warm for returning school children, and look to safety of a small boy."
That brought her up short and she was fiercely angry. Motherless home, indeed! Didn't she work her fingers to the bone to keep things going. It was more like a fatherless home. Gil did little enough. Wait till he got home. They'd have this out once and for all.
Then the doorbell rang.
Ellen could hardly pull herself together to see who was there.
"Why, Sister Handley," she said, "come in."
"I am glad you are at home," Sister Handley said. "Fern Orainder was arrested yesterday afternoon, and since she is such a friend of Joan's I thought you should know about it, and be prepared to meet Joan when she gets home tonight."
"I never heard of the child," Ellen said. "How could she be a friend of Joan's?"
"They are together constantly," Mrs. Handley said. "They pass my house every afternoon coming home from school, and then Fern goes past again back home just before you get home from work."
"Why was she arrested?" Ellen asked through white lips. She thought her heart would never beat again.
"Things have been disappearing from school right along, and they have been watching carefully. They have never caught her. But yesterday she was discovered in one of the downtown stores with something in her possession that she hadn't bought. Then they arrested her."
"Was Joan?" Ellen whispered.
"No, Joan came to take some flowers to Mrs. Cooke for me. She had promised and she kept her word although Fern had wanted her to go shopping. I had been hearing 500 things about the Onander child and decided to see a little more of Joan. She is such a dear little thing." "Because you were watching her she was saved from trouble that I didn't even know threatened," Ellen said, tears streaming down her face, "and I call myself a mother." She buried her head in her arms. "We all have to do the things we think important," Sister Handley soothed. "I thought my secretarial ability would win the war," Ellen said bitterly. "It is important," Sister Handley said. "You have a position of trust and are doing your work well." "But what good will that do if the next generation are criminals and weaklings? There is no use of saving America if there is no one to save it for," Ellen said in a muffled voice. "But what will I do about my job? Who will they get to carry on? It is important, too. Oh dear, everything is such a mess." Sister Handley thought a moment and said, "There is Mrs. Endor. She used to be a fine stenographer and she is just finishing a refresher course. Her children are married and her duties are very light." "But isn't she quite old?" Ellen asked. "Even the quite old have their place in this war," Sister Handlev smiled. "Her health is good and her fingers are still quick. I think she could work in. Perhaps you could work with her for a week or two." "I feel as if I never wanted to go to the office again," Ellen said. She saw again the words Gil had written, "Motherless home." It was really worse than motherless. She could see that now. If she were not here at all some adjustment would be made, but as long as she made a pretense of taking care of things the family expected her to be there, and to see that everything went smoothly. Sister Handley's voice broke into her thoughts, "We'll work out something," it said. Ellen was at home to greet her tear-stained daughter. "Mommy," Joan cried, flinging herself into Ellen's arms, "the most awful thing has happened." "Yes, my dear, I know. It is too bad about your friend," "She's a nice girl, really she is. She lives in such a funny house and no one is ever there, and she has such peculiar clothes and no one plays with her. I felt so sorry for her I just had to be her friend." Bless her dear, generous heart, Ellen thought. It might lead her into trouble many times, but it would be a blessing to her if she were guided right. Ellen explained as tactfully as she could that it was fine to be pleasant and nice to everyone, but that people were judged by the company they kept, and it might be wise to let mother see her friends and help her choose wisely. "Fern said you wouldn't let her come here if you knew about it, so we must keep it a secret," Joan said. Ellen hugged the child to her. "Now let's get busy and get Daddy a fine big dinner," she said. "In the dining room?" asked. "In the dining room," Ellen answered. Joan "
