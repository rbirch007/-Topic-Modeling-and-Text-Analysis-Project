Literature Dr. Russel B. Swensen Brigham Young University HE New Testament is a part of ancient Greek literature. It is true that it does not belong to the classical form of Greek writings which have been so cherished and arduously studied by scholars for many hundreds of years. In fact, it is so different from the polished and consciously literary forms of literature, that for many years scholars hardly knew how to classify it. Because its Greek syntax and style are so different from that of the classical literature, some thought that it was written in a special holy-inspired dialect. Others had the view that it was merely translation Greek, influenced by Aramaic in which they thought its contents had first been written. In 1897, two young English archaeologists, Grenfell and Hunt, made an epoch-making discovery. They unearthed, in the sands of Egypt, thousands of papyrus writings which had been deposited in various city garbage dumps to be burned. However, many had not been destroyed by fire. The shifting sands and Egypt's dry climate preserved this "paper garbage" for posterity. They were mostly the letters, notes, bills, summonses, and other types of personal, legal, and business writings which civilized people compose to meet the needs of a busy and fairly complex life. Many were written in Greek. Egypt had been ruled by the Greeks since the time of Alexander, who conquered the country in 332 B. C. Thousands of Greeks had migrated there to make their homes. In large cities, such as Alexandria, Greek was the dominant dialect. It remained for a young German clergyman, Adolph Deissmann, to appreciate fully these findings of Grenfell and Hunt. He made the starting discovery that the Greek syntax, construction, vocabulary, and style of these everyday compositions of ordinary people were the same as those of the New Testament Greek. Besides using the ordinary, colloquial Greek of the common people, the New Testament authors had little concern to achieve literary immortality. Most of them wrote anonymously. They took little time, on the whole, to polish and phrase their message with the delicate subtleties and grace that were characteristic of the Greek poets and dramatists. But they were on fire with a burning zeal to deliver a message, which gave a tone of powerful conviction to their writings that was overwhelming. They used simple, direct language. They were clear, vivid, and vigorous in their narration of events and ideas. Every expression of thought was meant to solve a practical difficulty in the young Christian Church. They had no time nor inclination to be "clever." The most renowned and popular literary. Form of New Testament writings is the four Gospels. They are basic in Christian esteem because they contain the account of Jesus' Page 483 484 ministry and teachings. They are also important because they exhibit a new type of literature that has no exact parallel nor antecedent in ancient literary history. These Gospels are difficult to classify. 'They are not purely biographies, martyrologies, heroic miracle tales, parables or sermons, but a new synthesis of these literary forms. It seems that their major purpose was to portray the career and significance of Jesus as revealed by his miracles, teachings, death and resurrection, for the inspiration and guidance of the primitive Christian Church. The resurrection is the most vital thing in the story of the Gospels. It is this, and not the details of Jesus' suffering, which mark them apart from the later Christian martyr tales. The whole Christian movement was founded upon this miracle. The appearance of the risen Jesus to the apostles was the significant act which revitalized and inspired them to begin their world-conquering mission. Accordingly the death, but above all, the resurrection played so large a part in the Christians' faith and certainty concerning the divinity of their Church. Paul is a most excellent witness of this fact in his long discussion of the basic importance of the resurrection in I Corinthians, Chapter 15. The teachings of Jesus were likewise a most vital treasure which the Gospels meant to preserve for the edification and instruction of prospective converts and young Church members. Mark, the earliest Gospel, is basically a narrative book of action, but at least half of the material in the other Gospels is concerned with the teaching phase of Jesus' ministry. In reading these Gospels carefully, it seems that Jesus considered the importance of his spiritual message to be far superior to his miracles. In two of the three temptations: the turning of stone into bread, and the leaping from a high tower, he rejected miraculous means as desirable methods for his ministry. In many cases of his healings, he specifically urged the healed person to say nothing about the miracle to any one. He realized that miraculous deeds would distract people from his spiritual teachings. His mission was to heal men's souls of evil inclinations and desires which were the cause of sin?more than to cure their bodies of physical disease. Nowhere in literature are so many great ideals of such profound spiritual and moral insight contained in such a small space as in the four Gospels. Jewish writers have attempted to show that there are parallels in the Old Testament and Talmudic writings to what Jesus said. But they had to cover thousands of pages of material to gather teachings that are even approximate to what Jesus taught. The letters of the New Testament are the second literary type found in this Scripture. In this form of literature there are numerous parallels to contemporary writings. The papyrus documents of Grenfell and Hunt reveal many intimate personal letters. A homesick soldier lad in the Roman legions on the Rhine frontier writes of his longing for his folks and the warm sunshine of the Nile valley. A poor workman, seeking employment in the great city of Alexandria, writes to his wife, an expectant mother, of his experiences in the great metropolis. In another letter, a spoiled schoolboy makes TYPES OF NEW TESTAMENT LITERATURE outrageous demands. Upon his parents. In addition to these homely and outspoken personal letters, the literary authors and important figures in public life of Greece and Rome wrote many consciously literary letters. Not only were these letters used widely in order to convey intimate personal messages, but also official communications and literary essays. Caesar wrote many letters while campaigning in Gaul, 'becoming one of the first war correspondents in history, in order to inform his Roman public about his noteworthy achievements. Letters were so highly regarded in the ancient world that letter collections and publications of the same became a widespread practice. Collections were made of the letters of Plato, Epicurus, Plutarch, Cicero, Apollonius of Tyana, etc. HE great figure responsible for most of our New Testament letters was the Apostle Paul. His letters are priceless for their human quality, their sincerity, and sublime faith. He was concerned with settling the problems and troubles of the Christian churches in various Greek cities in Greece and Asia Minor. He did this task with such spiritual insight, so intelligently, and | in such a_ straightforward, effective speech that many of his ideas have an eternal significance toward the solving of religious and moral problems. A noteworthy thing about his correspondence is that in many, OT most, of his letters he seems to have employed a scribe to take down his dictated message. In the ancient Greek cities there were public stenographic shops where such services could be secured for a nominal fee. 485 Shorthand writing was invented about 200 B. C., by the Greeks, and the public scribe was quite a commonplace craftsman. Paul's letters have a digressive, somewhat rambling style which indicate a hurried dictation. In the letter to the Galatians he mentions that he sometimes writes with his own hand (Gal. 6:11). This practice of dictating imparts to his letters a style similar to the spoken word. A number of scholars find much similarity in his style of utterance with the public addresses of the Stoic philosophers who were wont to speak to the crowds in Greek and Roman cities on moral questions. Paul's letters are mostly extremely personal messages. In his personal letter to Philemon he begs the wealthy Christian, Philemon, to accept and forgive his runaway Christian slave, Onesimus, whom Paul had met in Rome and persuaded to return to his former master. It is a classic of tender love, tact, and persuasive reasoning. In his expression of great ideals he is sometimes very poetic. Gilbert Murray, the English classical scholar, states that his rhapsody on love, in First Corinthians, Chapter 13, compares well with the best in Greek poetry in its sublimity of feeling and expression. The letter to the Romans is Paul's most formal letter. Here he writes to the Roman church to introduce himself and to expound his fundamental religious principles to them. The other letters of the New Testament, I and IT Peter; I, II, It John; James; and Jude are general, circular letters. They do not have the personal qualities of Paul's letters. They deal largely with the 486 problems of persecution and heresy. They are not addressed to any single church, and they are obviously much later in date of composition. On the whole, they are not of such high spiritual quality as Paul's letters, although in the Johannine letters and in James there are some outstanding teachings on love and practical Christianity. Another literary form found in the New Testament is a historical composition. The Book of Acts is a history of the Church from the death of Jesus to the death of Paul. Luke, the author, has quite obviously followed the historical and literary methods of the great Greek historians, especially Thucydides, who wrote during the latter part of the fifth century, B. C. He pays much attention to original primary sources, dates, contemporary political leaders, the names of different cities and provinces. He is quite objective and reveals a consistent and definite philosophy of history in his composition. He also follows Thucydides' habit of inserting long speeches for his major characters into his narrative. His book could really be called the history of Christianity from its birth in Jerusalem, the capital of Judaism, to the great provinces of Syria, Asia Minor, and Greece through the two greatest heroes of Christian tradition, Peter and Paul. The last basic literary type is that of an apocalypse or revelation. The Book of Revelation employs this device which, alone of all New Testament writings, is Jewish instead of Greek. The Jewish apocalypses were writings composed in times of acute crises which purported to reveal to the contemporaries of the author what God had in store for the chosen people and the future of the world. In such books the terrible sufferings of the faithful servants of God would have to be endured because the Messiah would come in the future to alleviate them. He would be preceded by great cosmic calamities, earthquakes, storms, astronomical disturbances, wars, disease, and famine. He would overcome such natural and human evils, and would institute a millennial reign of peace. The resurrection and judgment of all men was an important phase of many of these apocalypses. The authors generally attributed their writing to some ancient prophet in order to secure acceptance of their messages. However, the revelation of John differed from these writings by using his own name, John, instead of attributing his words to someone else. His imagery is full of Jewish symbols and ideas. It is one of the most Jewish writings in the New Testament. Although the language and style are quite harsh and rough, it is idiomatic and colloquial Greek. This book is the most dramatic in the whole New Testament. There is a tremendous vigor and uncompromising courage about it which must have had a vital hope and inspiration to the persecuted Christians living at the end of the first century A. D. It proclaims that even though the world is in the hands of Satanic powers, yet, in the end, the forces of eternal righteousness will triumph and overthrow all cosmic and human evil. This will happen when Jesus comes again to establish his millennial kingdom, to bring about the resurrection and judgment of all men.
