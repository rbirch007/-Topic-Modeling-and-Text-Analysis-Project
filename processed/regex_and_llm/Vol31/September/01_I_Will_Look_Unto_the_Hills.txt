I WILL LOOK UNTO THE HILLS Della Adams Leitner The hills speak to me in their changelessness And in their changing moods of light and shade. At dawn, rose-crowned, with gleaming peaks arrayed With filmy clouds, they give no hint of stress; But when, storm-ridden, dark with gloominess They stand serene and bid me, unafraid, Be brave and strong, patient and undismayed, I gain new power to meet the storm's duress. "Unto the hills I look," the psalmist said, "From them comes help"?and I have found it so; My burdened heart is warmly comforted By what they give, and I have come to know Unchanging is God's promise for He wills "Strength of the hills'"?"the everlasting hills."

Types of New Testament Literature Dr. Russel B. Swensen Brigham Young University HE New Testament is a part of ancient Greek literature. It is true that it does not belong to the classical form of Greek writings which have been so cherished and arduously studied by scholars for many hundreds of years. In fact, it is so different from the polished and consciously literary forms of literature, that for many years scholars hardly knew how to classify it. Because its Greek syntax and style are so different from that of the classical literature, some thought that it was written in a special holy-inspired dialect. Others had the view that it was merely translation Greek, influenced by Aramaic in which they thought its contents had first been written. In 1897, two young English archaeologists, Grenfell and Hunt, made an epoch-making discovery. They unearthed, in the sands of Egypt, thousands of papyrus writings which had been deposited in various city garbage dumps to be burned. However, many had not been destroyed by fire. The shifting sands and Egypt's dry climate preserved this "paper garbage" for posterity. They were mostly the letters, notes, bills, summonses, and other types of personal, legal, and business writings which civilized people compose to meet the needs of a busy and fairly complex life. Many were written in Greek. Egypt had been ruled by the Greeks since the time of Alexander, who conquered the country in 332 B. C. Thousands of Greeks had migrated there to make their homes. In large cities, such as Alexandria, Greek was the dominant dialect. It remained for a young German clergyman, Adolph Deissmann, to appreciate fully these findings of Grenfell and Hunt. He made the starting discovery that the Greek syntax, construction, vocabulary, and style of these everyday compositions of ordinary people were the same as those of the New Testament Greek. Besides using the ordinary, colloquial Greek of the common people, the New Testament authors had little concern to achieve literary immortality. Most of them wrote anonymously. They took little time, on the whole, to polish and phrase their message with the delicate subtleties and grace that were characteristic of the Greek poets and dramatists. But they were on fire with a burning zeal to deliver a message, which gave a tone of powerful conviction to their writings that was overwhelming. They used simple, direct language. They were clear, vivid, and vigorous in their narration of events and ideas. Every expression of thought was meant to solve a practical difficulty in the young Christian Church. They had no time nor inclination to be "clever." The most renowned and popular literary. Form of New Testament writings is the four Gospels. They are basic in Christian esteem because they contain the account of Jesus' Page 483 484 ministry and teachings. They are also important because they exhibit a new type of literature that has no exact parallel nor antecedent in ancient literary history. These Gospels are difficult to classify. 'They are not purely biographies, martyrologies, heroic miracle tales, parables or sermons, but a new synthesis of these literary forms. It seems that their major purpose was to portray the career and significance of Jesus as revealed by his miracles, teachings, death and resurrection, for the inspiration and guidance of the primitive Christian Church. The resurrection is the most vital thing in the story of the Gospels. It is this, and not the details of Jesus' suffering, which mark them apart from the later Christian martyr tales. The whole Christian movement was founded upon this miracle. The appearance of the risen Jesus to the apostles was the significant act which revitalized and inspired them to begin their world-conquering mission. Accordingly the death, but above all, the resurrection played so large a part in the Christians' faith and certainty concerning the divinity of their Church. Paul is a most excellent witness of this fact in his long discussion of the basic importance of the resurrection in I Corinthians, Chapter 15. The teachings of Jesus were likewise a most vital treasure which the Gospels meant to preserve for the edification and instruction of prospective converts and young Church members. Mark, the earliest Gospel, is basically a narrative book of action, but at least half of the material in the other Gospels is concerned with the teaching phase of Jesus' ministry. In reading these Gospels carefully, it seems that Jesus considered the importance of his spiritual message to be far superior to his miracles. In two of the three temptations: the turning of stone into bread, and the leaping from a high tower, he rejected miraculous means as desirable methods for his ministry. In many cases of his healings, he specifically urged the healed person to say nothing about the miracle to any one. He realized that miraculous deeds would distract people from his spiritual teachings. His mission was to heal men's souls of evil inclinations and desires which were the cause of sin?more than to cure their bodies of physical disease. Nowhere in literature are so many great ideals of such profound spiritual and moral insight contained in such a small space as in the four Gospels. Jewish writers have attempted to show that there are parallels in the Old Testament and Talmudic writings to what Jesus said. But they had to cover thousands of pages of material to gather teachings that are even approximate to what Jesus taught. The letters of the New Testament are the second literary type found in this Scripture. In this form of literature there are numerous parallels to contemporary writings. The papyrus documents of Grenfell and Hunt reveal many intimate personal letters. A homesick soldier lad in the Roman legions on the Rhine frontier writes of his longing for his folks and the warm sunshine of the Nile valley. A poor workman, seeking employment in the great city of Alexandria, writes to his wife, an expectant mother, of his experiences in the great metropolis. In another letter, a spoiled schoolboy makes TYPES OF NEW TESTAMENT LITERATURE outrageous demands. Upon his parents. In addition to these homely and outspoken personal letters, the literary authors and important figures in public life of Greece and Rome wrote many consciously literary letters. Not only were these letters used widely in order to convey intimate personal messages, but also official communications and literary essays. Caesar wrote many letters while campaigning in Gaul, 'becoming one of the first war correspondents in history, in order to inform his Roman public about his noteworthy achievements. Letters were so highly regarded in the ancient world that letter collections and publications of the same became a widespread practice. Collections were made of the letters of Plato, Epicurus, Plutarch, Cicero, Apollonius of Tyana, etc. HE great figure responsible for most of our New Testament letters was the Apostle Paul. His letters are priceless for their human quality, their sincerity, and sublime faith. He was concerned with settling the problems and troubles of the Christian churches in various Greek cities in Greece and Asia Minor. He did this task with such spiritual insight, so intelligently, and | in such a_ straightforward, effective speech that many of his ideas have an eternal significance toward the solving of religious and moral problems. A noteworthy thing about his correspondence is that in many, OT most, of his letters he seems to have employed a scribe to take down his dictated message. In the ancient Greek cities there were public stenographic shops where such services could be secured for a nominal fee. 485 Shorthand writing was invented about 200 B. C., by the Greeks, and the public scribe was quite a commonplace craftsman. Paul's letters have a digressive, somewhat rambling style which indicate a hurried dictation. In the letter to the Galatians he mentions that he sometimes writes with his own hand (Gal. 6:11). This practice of dictating imparts to his letters a style similar to the spoken word. A number of scholars find much similarity in his style of utterance with the public addresses of the Stoic philosophers who were wont to speak to the crowds in Greek and Roman cities on moral questions. Paul's letters are mostly extremely personal messages. In his personal letter to Philemon he begs the wealthy Christian, Philemon, to accept and forgive his runaway Christian slave, Onesimus, whom Paul had met in Rome and persuaded to return to his former master. It is a classic of tender love, tact, and persuasive reasoning. In his expression of great ideals he is sometimes very poetic. Gilbert Murray, the English classical scholar, states that his rhapsody on love, in First Corinthians, Chapter 13, compares well with the best in Greek poetry in its sublimity of feeling and expression. The letter to the Romans is Paul's most formal letter. Here he writes to the Roman church to introduce himself and to expound his fundamental religious principles to them. The other letters of the New Testament, I and IT Peter; I, II, It John; James; and Jude are general, circular letters. They do not have the personal qualities of Paul's letters. They deal largely with the 486 problems of persecution and heresy. They are not addressed to any single church, and they are obviously much later in date of composition. On the whole, they are not of such high spiritual quality as Paul's letters, although in the Johannine letters and in James there are some outstanding teachings on love and practical Christianity. Another literary form found in the New Testament is a historical composition. The Book of Acts is a history of the Church from the death of Jesus to the death of Paul. Luke, the author, has quite obviously followed the historical and literary methods of the great Greek historians, especially Thucydides, who wrote during the latter part of the fifth century, B. C. He pays much attention to original primary sources, dates, contemporary political leaders, the names of different cities and provinces. He is quite objective and reveals a consistent and definite philosophy of history in his composition. He also follows Thucydides' habit of inserting long speeches for his major characters into his narrative. His book could really be called the history of Christianity from its birth in Jerusalem, the capital of Judaism, to the great provinces of Syria, Asia Minor, and Greece through the two greatest heroes of Christian tradition, Peter and Paul. The last basic literary type is that of an apocalypse or revelation. The Book of Revelation employs this device which, alone of all New Testament writings, is Jewish instead of Greek. The Jewish apocalypses were writings composed in times of acute crises which purported to reveal to the contemporaries of the author what God had in store for the chosen people and the future of the world. In such books the terrible sufferings of the faithful servants of God would have to be endured because the Messiah would come in the future to alleviate them. He would be preceded by great cosmic calamities, earthquakes, storms, astronomical disturbances, wars, disease, and famine. He would overcome such natural and human evils, and would institute a millennial reign of peace. The resurrection and judgment of all men was an important phase of many of these apocalypses. The authors generally attributed their writing to some ancient prophet in order to secure acceptance of their messages. However, the revelation of John differed from these writings by using his own name, John, instead of attributing his words to someone else. His imagery is full of Jewish symbols and ideas. It is one of the most Jewish writings in the New Testament. Although the language and style are quite harsh and rough, it is idiomatic and colloquial Greek. This book is the most dramatic in the whole New Testament. There is a tremendous vigor and uncompromising courage about it which must have had a vital hope and inspiration to the persecuted Christians living at the end of the first century A. D. It proclaims that even though the world is in the hands of Satanic powers, yet, in the end, the forces of eternal righteousness will triumph and overthrow all cosmic and human evil. This will happen when Jesus comes again to establish his millennial kingdom, to bring about the resurrection and judgment of all men. Luacine Savage Clark President Amy Brown Lyman THE Relief Society has lost a staunch and faithful friend and an active and valued worker in the death of Luacine Savage Clark, wife of Elder J. Reuben Clark, Jr., first counselor in the First Presidency of the Church and former ambassador to Mexico. Sister Clark passed away at her home in Salt Lake City in the early dawn of August 2, 1944, surrounded by the members of her family?her husband, three daughters, and one son, who had tenderly and lovingly ministered to her during the many weeks of her illness. The prayer of her sister workers in Relief Society is that the peace of heaven may come into the hearts of her husband, children, and other loved ones, tempering their sorrow and helping them to find reconciliation. Sister Clark was a daughter of Charles R. And Annie Adkins Savage. From these pioneer parents, natives of England who came to Utah in early days, she received a rich heritage in her many fine attributes of heart and mind. Her father was Utah's pioneer photographer and art dealer, and founder of the annual Old Folks' Day. Her mother, while caring for her home and eleven children, found time to be helpful to her Church, to entertain many friends in her hospitable home, and to be a good neighbor to the needy and sorrowing. Sister Clark was well known for her fine abilities and able leadership. Whether acting as hostess in the LUACINE SAVAGE CLARK ambassadorial mansion in Mexico City or as Relief Society stake president, theology class leader, or visiting teacher, she was equally at home. She was an asset to both her Church and community. A faithful, consistent Latter-day Saint, she gave freely of her time and talents to whatever task was assigned her, whether it was working in an auxiliary organization or contributing as a writer to a Church periodical. Relief Society work was one of her major interests from the age of eighteen. She has served the Society faithfully and efficiently in various capacities. It is a tribute to her example and training that her daughter Marianne, wife of (Continued on page 510) Page 487 Rumania Dr. Leland Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah PART II [This is the second part of the article on Rumania in the series being written by Dr. Creer on the historical background of some of the European countries involved in the present war. The map of Rumania appeared in the August issue of the Magazine. ] Alexander Couza, directed his energies toward the improvement of the social and economic conditions of his people. Between the years 1862 and 186s, he carried through, despite much opposition especially from the aristocratic feudal party, a series of far-reaching reforms, mainly concerned with education and agrarian interests. He founded two universities, one at Jassy and one at Buchatest; he established a number of secondary and technical schools, all of them free, and made elementary education not only gratuitous but nominally compulsory. Despite Couza's efforts, the percentage of illiteracy in Rumania is still very large; in 1920, it was sixty per cent of all people over seven years. Couza solved the agrarian problem by abolishing feudalism. All dues, both in labor and kind, were rescinded, in return for an indemnity advanced to the lords by the state to be repaid in installments to the latter by the peasants; one-third of the land was turned over to the peasants, leaving the remaining two-thirds in possession of the lords. But these measures did not satisfy the peasantry, and today the agrarian problem remains the most serious of all Rumania's domestic difficulties. During the thirty years immediately preceding the outbreak of World War I, no less than five insurrections occurred among the Rumanian peasantry. Page 488 Meanwhile, a_ revolution headed by the opposition succeeded in deposing Couza, in 1866. Hardly a voice was raised for the unhappy prince. Not a drop of blood was shed in his behalf. "He passed silently out of the land for which he had dared much, and seven years later he died in exile." Couza was succeeded by Prince Carol, the second son of the Prince of Hohenzollern - Sigmaringen, the elder and Catholic branch of the Hohenzollerns at Berlin. The new prince at once directed his attention to reforming the government. A liberal constitution was granted in 1866, and, although considerably amended in 1879 and 1884 and still further during the turbulent Twenties following World War I, it was still basically the constitution in operation in Rumania before the period of German occupation. The document provided for a cabinet of nine members who were responsible to the legislature. The latter is bicameral in form, but both chambers RUMANIA are elective. In each case, however, the election is indirect, the elections being made through electoral colleges, composed of the taxpayers who are divided into three colleges, according to the amount of taxes paid. This, of course, confines the suffrage to the wealthier classes. The Senate consists of 120 members, who must be at least forty years of age and possess an income of 376 pounds a year, and their term of office is for eight years. The Chamber of Deputies consists of 183 members, who are elected for four years and must be at least twenty-five years of age, Despite this quasi democratic form of government described above, the tendency in Rumania, as well as in all the other Balkan states, has been toward autocracy. Perhaps the absence of adequate middle classes and insufficient popular education, together with the continued intrigue of foreign powers which has served as a constant threat to the very existence of the Balkan nationalities themselves, has mitigated against the growth of democratic institutions. As one authority puts it: Each government seemed to acquire a majority of seats with a minority of votes, and sooner or later they all relapsed into some form of dictatorship. Kings and courts and armies came into their own again, and with a minimum of popular opposition. Dictatorships were set up in Yugoslavia in 1929-31, in Bulgaria in 1935, in Greece in 1936, and in Rumania in 1938. (Age of Conflict, P- 353) From a social and economic standpoint, the long reign of Prince Carol (1866-1914) was one of marked improvement and prosperity. A few notable examples will suffice. In. Of World War I. 489 1866, there did not exist a single railway in the state; in 1912, 3690 kilometers had been constructed. The export of cereals in 1866 was less than 500,000 tons; in 1913, it amounted to 1,320,235. Of petroleum, the production in 1866 was 5.915 tons; in 1912, it was 2,000,000. The total state budget in 1866 was 56,000,000 francs; in 1912, it was more than 500,000,000, In the Russo-Turkish War (1877-78), the Rumanian army numbered 40,000; in World War I, it was more than 1,000,000. The external trade of the country, consisting mainly of oil and cereals, in 1912 amounted to more than 50,000,000 francs, and exceeded that of all the other Balkan states together. The interesting point is that most of this foreign trade was with the Central Powers. In 1912, for example, imports from the United Kingdom totaled less than 2,000,000 francs; from Germany and Austria-Hungary they amounted to more than 13,000,000. The analysis of Rumania's foreign trade statistics indicates eloquently enough the orientation of Rumanian foreign policy before the outbreak On more than One occasion, King Carol unmistakably demonstrated his sympathies for the Central Powers?Germany and Austria. This accounts for the secret adherence of Rumania to the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria, and Italy), concluded in 1883 and 1889. The alliance provided, in substance, that if Rumania or Austria were attacked without Provocation on their part by Russia, the two contracting powers would mutually assist one another against the aggressor. Should a third party intervene (notably France), 490 Germany and Italy were obligated to support the contracting powers. 'This new Quadruple Agreement was renewed from time to time. The last renewal took place on February 5, 1913, when the agreement was extended to July 8, 1920, and explains, largely, the neutral position of Rumania during the first two years of World War I (1914-16). Over and against this Rumanian-German solidarity of interests were three important factors which threatened, and finally did succeed, in winning Rumania away from the Triple Alliance into the concert of Allied Powers known as the Triple Entente (England, Russia, and France). These were: (1) the Hungarian-Magyar policy toward Transylvania; (2) the Austrian support of Bulgaria's position against Rumania at the outbreak of the Second Balkan War (1913); and (3) the Russo-Serb wooing to win Rumania away from the Triple Alliance, by suggesting and sponsoring the so-called Balkan League, directed primarily against Turkey. During the Second Balkan War (1913), Rumania became an ally of Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro against Bulgaria and Turkey, both later allies of Germany and Austria. Asa result of this conflict, Rumania added 2,687 square miles of territory in the region known as Dobrudja, with a population of 286,000, entirely at the expense, of course, of Bulgaria. This included the important fortress of Silistria on the Black Sea. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Rumania, officially friendly to Germany, hesitated to enter the war on the side of the Central Powers. True, the coveted districts of Transylvania and Bukovina were in the hands of the Hapsburgs, but the equally coveted province of Bessarabia was held by Russia. 'Then, too, the sympathies of the masses unmistakably were for their Latin neighbors France and Italy. 'The question was: "Could Rumania hope, either by diplomacy or by war, to achieve the complete reunion of the Rumanian people?" This was the coveted goal. The issue was decided largely through the death of King Carol in 1914. With the king's passing, there was eliminated the strongest pro-German force within the kingdom. On August 27, 1916, Rumania, after two years of strict neutrality, declared war upon Austria and Germany. By secret treaty with England, Russia, Italy, and France, she was promised Transylvania from Hungary, Bukovina from Austria, and the Banat of Temesvar from Hungary. But within four months, German armies under Generals Mackensen and Falkenhayn conquered practically all of Rumania and then, on May 27, 1918, forced upon the hapless people the humiliating Treaty of Bucharest. Its terms granted the Central Powers a monopoly of Rumanian grain and oil for a period of thirty years. Hungary secured a frontier along the Carpathians which would secure her from a future Rumanian attack. The ports of Constanta, Giurgiu, and Turnu-Severin, all on the Black Sea and the Danube River, were leased to Germany and Austria-Hungary. 491 The Dobrudja, though claimed by Bulgaria, was allotted to the joint administration of the four allied powers?Germany, Austria - Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Bessarabia, alone, was permitted to join herself to the Rumanian state. Such was the cruel treaty of Bucharest, disastrous to Rumania, destructive of her economic and political independence, deeply humiliating to her pride.
Yet, despite the misfortune of Rumania in 1916, she not only recovered her losses through the postwar treaties of Versailles, Saint Germain, Trianon, and Neuilly, but more than doubled her territorial area by adding Transylvania from Hungary, Bukovina and the Banat of Temesvar from Austria, and Bessarabia from Russia. Thus in 1920, for the first time since the brilliant conquests of Michael the Brave (1593-1601), a Rumanian state which included all Rumanians had been created. However, this great achievement was destined to be short-lived, for, within twenty years, the new state was undone by the second conquest of the Germans who reimposed a second and more onerous Treaty of Bucharest upon the hapless Rumanians in 1939.
THIS twenty-year interim between the First and Second World Wars is extremely complicated, and yet highly important and prophetic of the future of the new Rumania. The following trends of development are noted:
Emphasis was given to political and economic reform. In 1923, King Ferdinand authorized the promulgation of a constitution which abolished the old three-class system of indirect election, and extended the suffrage literally among the masses. Greater attention, too, was given the important question of agrarian reform. About one-half of the arable lands of Rumania was owned before 1916 by a few thousand large proprietors, and this despite the efforts, as we have seen, of Rumania's first sovereign, Alexander Couza (1851-1866.) By the land reforms of 1917, 1918, and 1921, about 5,000,000 acres of nobility-owned land and all the arable lands of the royal, absentee, and foreign owners were confiscated. No farm could exceed 1200 acres in area. Compensation was provided for in fifty-year national bonds at five per cent of the expropriation price. In the newly acquired territories, the large land holdings were reduced to about 250 acres in Bessarabia, 625 acres in Bukovina, and 500 acres in Transylvania. In old Rumania, the average peasant land holding was twelve acres; in Dobrudja, twenty to sixty acres; in Bessarabia, fifteen to twenty acres; in Bukovina, ten acres; and in Transylvania, ten acres. By 1930, these reforms, about ninety per cent of the land was in the hands of peasant proprietors. This program encountered considerable opposition in Transylvania, where the large landowners were Magyars. These, by the Treaty of Trianon, had been accorded the right to choose between Hungarian and Rumanian citizenship. If they elected the former, Rumania was forbidden to confiscate their lands, since they held their property as foreigners. But when the Rumanian government did so, the disappointed Transylvanians appealed to the League of Nations in behalf of their opt. The matter was finally settled by the League Council in January 1930, when the so-called Brocchi plan was adopted. This provided for the reimbursement of the expropriate optants through a fund created by the leading Allied Powers and Hungary. Nevertheless, the animosity between Rumania and Hungary over this question persists to the present day. 492 The political equation in postwar Rumania has been rendered unusually complicated and dangerous _because of the intense rivalry between political factions, and especially because of the strange role played by the former Crown Prince and later King Carol II. The Liberal Party ruled Rumania until 1928 under the leadership of her kings, Carol I (1866-1914) and Ferdinand (1914- 1927), and their ministers, John C. Bratianu and his sons Jon and Vintila. This party, representing largely the business interests of the country and the intelligensia, advocated policies of centralization, national self-sufficiency, government ownership, and control of forests and mines; and opposed vigorously the importation of foreign capital, even when the capital was meant to be employed for the development of national resources. The Conservative Party, on the other hand, representing the land-owning classes, favored the use of foreign capital, a liberal trade policy, and a definite orientation in foreign policy toward the Central Powers?Germany and Austria. In 1926, the Peasant Parties?that of Rumania led by Michalache, and that of Transylvania, by the brilliant Maniu, were fused and succeeded the Liberals in power, in 1928. This party advocated the following compromise program: (1) repeal of the censorship; (2) suppression of anti-Semitism; (3) the attraction of foreign capital to develop the national oil industry; (4) development of railroads and other public works; and (5) the stabilization of the monetary system.: Meanwhile, Crown Prince Carol interjected himself strangely into the imbroglio of Rumanian politics. In December 1925, Carol divorced his wife, Princess Helen of Greece, and went to Paris to live with his mistress, Mme. Magda Lupescu. His mother, Queen Marie, and Premier Bratianu, disapproving of his behavior, had a new succession law enacted, January 4, 1926, which denied the throne to the Crown Prince, made his five-year-old son, Michael, his heir, and provided for a Regency -in the event that King Ferdinand died before his grandson reached maturity. The King died in July 1927, and the boy, Michael, accordingly became king, under a Regency headed by Queen Marie and Premier Bratianu. Now the Nationalist Peasant Party, headed by Maniu and backed by the army, advocated the restoration of Crown Prince Carol, but upon the condition that he should become reconciled to his estranged wife, Helen. Meanwhile, Carol did return to Bucharest, July 8, 1930, had himself proclaimed king, abolished the opposition party in power, refused to become reconciled to Princess Helen, openly courted the favor of the Central Powers, and eventually set aside the constitution and proclaimed himself dictator, in February 1938. But King Carol could not assert his dictatorial powers in the face of Axis opposition. For Hitler, flushed with success, had covetous eyes on Rumania because it was the gateway to the Balkans, and an important granary and oil reserve for continental RUMANIA Europe. Accordingly, in September 1940, he arranged to have Rumania dismembered. Bessarabia was given to Russia; Transylvania to Hungary; and southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria. In addition, the state's important grain and oil reserves were requisitioned to Germany. King Carol was forced to abdicate in favor of his son Michael, who became a German puppet king. One of the encouraging trends in modern Rumania is the enthusiasm noted among political leaders toward the Balkan co-operative movement. This program was initiated first by Stanbulisky of Bulgaria and Stephen Radich, founder of the Croat Peasant Party. Immediately after World War I, Rumania joined the movement. Village school teachers and priests joined with intellectual idealists from the towns to found the Rumanian Peasant Party under the leadership of Julius Maniu, who at once joined with Stahbulisky in founding the Southern Slav Federation. In 1920, the organization emerged into what became known as the Green International, a society neither capitalist nor Marxist, which tried, though unsuccessfully, to create a union of all southeastern peasant parties. After 1930, this initial peasant co-operative movement became a part of the larger program for economic and political Balkan union. In 1932, for instance, there was a joint meeting of the Yugoslav, Bulgarian, and Rumanian agricultural co-operatives under the influence of the Third Balkan Conference. THE first move toward political union was made at Athens in October 1929, when a conference of 493 Balkan states, presided over by ex-premier Alexander Papanastasiou, was held. From the beginning, Papanastasiou became the guiding spirit of the conference movement, and he found considerable support in all the Balkan states for his plea for union among the Balkan peoples ?even including Turkey?on the ground that they had shared "similar or common destinies and vicissitudes; that they had lived for centuries within the same political' framework; and because they had similar habits and ideas and sufficiently common interests." The First Balkan Conference was opened in the Greek Chamber of Deputies on October 5th, 1930, and thereafter, a permanent machinery was set up for the convoking of annual conferences and the interim work of its various committees. Among the concrete achievements of these conferences are listed: (1) the organization of a Balkan Chamber of Commerce and Industry; (2) a Chamber of Agriculture; (3) a Tourist Federation; and (4) a Balkan Federation of Jurists to codify and simplify the law. At the Fourth Conference, at Saloniki, the formation of a Balkan Labor Office was planned and the protection of women in industry was deliberated upon. Through the committee on social policy, appointed at this same conference, both Greek and Turkish delegates worked to initiate the principles of free admission, free circulation, and free. Economic activity for all Balkan nationals on a basis of complete reciprocity. At the Third Conference at Bucharest, Rumania's proposal for a medical 494 union was made the basis for a later. Balkan Medical Federation, one of whose functions was the supervision and development of rural hygiene. The educational value undoubtedly was the major result of the conferences. Through their deliberations the delegates obtained _firsthand knowledge of the leading personalities in all of the six countries and it became customary for them to propose and to provide for the taking of joint action in the solving of their common problems. With regard to foreign relations, Rumania, despite the sympathetic leanings of her kings to the Hohenzollerns, has pursued a policy of the following delineations: (1) Close collaboration with her fellow Balkan states in the interest of territorial security. This accounts for the organizations of the Balkan Pact, including Turkey, Rumania, Greece, and Yugoslavia, in 1934. Bulgaria refused to join, but without rancor. Albania was not even asked to sign on account of her close relation with Italy. (2) The affiliation of Rumania with France and the Little Entente (Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Rumania) in order to guarantee, as far as possible, the sanctity of the postwar treaties of Versailles, Saint Germain, Trianon and Nuilly. This was concluded in 1921. A second agreement with France, in 1926, provided for a strict non-aggression pact and an agreement to submit all disputes to arbitrations. Rumania, in a special protocol of the same year, promised not to provoke a war with Russia, for France had no desire to become involved in a military conflict because of an ally's ageression. (3) Rumania has consistently supported the League of Nations' Program. (4) Despite the rancor of Russia because of the loss of Bessarabia, relations between Russia and Rumania have been strangely friendly. In 1929, for example, Russia induced Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Rumania to adhere to the Litvinov Protocol declaring the provisions of the Briand-Kellogg Pact, outlawing war, to be operative at once. (5) Rumania has pursued a consistent policy of friendship with regard to Poland. The successful role of Rumania as an important power in Europe will depend upon the following factors: (1) the defeat of the Nazi and Fascist aggressors and the liberation of the Balkans from foreign influences; (2) the continued success of the co-operative movement among the Balkans themselves, especially with regard to economic matters; (3) the organization of some kind of program of collective security? through some kind of League of Nations?which will be able to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all small states; (4) the organization of a state based as far as possible upon the principle of nationality, extreme care being taken, however, to accord all minority groups fair treatment and political and economic justice; (5) the proper solution of dynastic difficulties; if King Carol II is to be returned as sovereign, the Rumanians will insist upon democratic government and conventional procedures; and (6) continued friendly relations with Russia, especially since the Bessarabian question appears to be the most rancorous of all Rumanian problems. Help Wanted Nora Wayne, ELLEN stood on the crowded bus, one hand clutching the back of a seat, and swayed with its lurchings. Her mind was Performing its usual five-o'clock treadmill. How Many potatoes were left from dinner last night? If there should be enough to cream she could open a can of salmon and dinner would be easy, No, she had used the last of the salmon a week ago. There hadn't been any in the shops for a long time now. What could she fix? Since the meat shortage it had been hard to think up quick meals. She'd have to wait until she got home and see what there was on hand. They'd have to get along on what she could find, she was just too utterly weary to shop tonight. She Supposed she wasn't 4 good manager. Maybe she wouldn't get so tired if she didn't do all her work twice, once thinking of it and dreading it, and once when she did it. If Gil were only more CO-operative. But he didn't want her to ? work, The crowd and Ellen sank exhausted into a seat. She couldn't understand why that day her boss had said, "What we'd do without you, Mrs. Jones, it Scares me to think. You are so quick and so accurate." But Gil Said. "Mothers are needed in the home." If he did his part and backed her up with the children, everyone could Carty more of the household load and she could go on working easily. But Gil believed that even in war a home should be a Sanctuary where the beauties of life were treasured. Beauties! There were no beauties on the battle fields. Was there any reason why every one should not suffer and sacrifice? Her corner at last! She wondered if she would have the energy to climb the two blocks uphill. Nights it seemed more like How good the house looked, messy as it was after Joan' Paper, but Gil would be home and she must get dinner started. If only he wouldn't talk about her work to. She would try hard to be pleasant and attractive, and maybe he wouldn't think about it. Twelve-year-old David and Joan were in the kitchen and had the table set. "Good children," she cy were sweet, really, and did their best to help out. Ellen found a glass of chipped beef and a can of milk. There were a few greens in the ice box and she tossed a salad and made some toast for the creamed chipped beef. As she buttered the bread she heard Gil come in. "Dinner asked. "It's so much less effort to clear up after," she said pleasantly. Page 495 smiled. In the kitchen?" he 496 '"My idea of a rich man is one who eats dinner in the dining room every night." Gil said. Oh dear, he was going to be difficult. Of course, she could serve dinner in the dining room and have flowers on the table and fresh napkins every day when that was all she did. "Find Tommy," she said to Joan, "and wash his hands. Dinner's all ready." Ellen smiled at Gil as they all sat down at the table. "Tell me about your day," she said. "Nothing to tell," he answered grumpily. All right, if he was going to be like that, let him. She wasn't going to put forth all the effort. The meal was finished in silence. As she washed the dishes the phone rang?Sister Handley wanting her to give a lesson in Relief Society. Would they never remember that she worked? Ellen wondered why they tried to hold Relief Society with all the women so busy doing war work. What place did peacetime organizations have in a war-torn world? She wasn't as careful in wording her refusal as she should have been. As she hung up the phone, Tommy came into the kitchen. "Why aren't you in bed?" she cried. "Do I even have to put you to bed? It seems to me that a big boy of seven could do a few things himself." Tommy looked at her reproachfully. "I was only going to tell you about my war work," he said. "Some other time," she answered impatiently. "Now hurry, and get through the tub and hop into bed." Tommy saw no relenting in her set lips and tramped sullenly upstairs. A night or two later Ellen sat alone in the living room. Gil was out and she was just too weary to go upstairs to bed. She had finished the ironing and sat with some mending on her lap. The pile was huge. It did seem that the children's clothes wore out fast, and the household linen was all going to pieces. She never got all the way to the bottom of the pile any more. She wondered where Gil was. When he saw her get out the ironing board, he had put on his hat and gone out. It was like this often now. She worked alone until far into the night. There were so many things Gil could help her with if he would. He was just trying to make it hard for her. It did something to a man's pride. Her mother had said, for his wife to work. She had tried so hard to get Ellen not to take work outside her home, but that was silly and old-fashioned. Besides, Gil knew she didn't work for the money. She was sincerely patriotic and worked because she thought it her duty. She was an excellent secretary and there was need for everyone who could use a typewriter. Oh well, maybe some day he would see it., She rose wearily to go upstairs just as Gil came into the room. "Tt's about time you got home," she said hotly. "Besides all that ironing, I had Tommy's bath to supervise and then had to help Joan with her arithmetic. You don't do anything around here any more." "After all I have my business," he answered. "It's a pretty big thing to keep it going with priorities of men and material." He did look tired and thinner HELP WANTED than he had, but so was Ellen tired. "It wouldn't hurt you to take a little of the responsibility," she flung, "You do the Physical things," he retorted, "and I don't say they aren't important. But what do you really know about any of our lives? Or what do you care?" A cold hand clutched her throat, What did she know about their lives? Where had Ci been tonight and where had he been three nights last week? She would cry if she spoke, she prepared for bed in silence. Longing to put her arm around him and snuggle her head in his shoulder, she lay stiffly on her side of the bed un. Quarrel was not patched up in the morning, and for days they lived in a sort of armed truce, The children watched them for any sign of the old gay family spirit, and went about dejectedly, fearful. ONE night at dinner Gil sniffed inquiringly, and asked, "Is there gas leaking?" "I do smell something," Ellen said. "I hadn't noticed it before," and she got up to check the gas cocks, "Maybe it's me," David said. ?I stumbled over all those old papers Tommy has in my work room and knocked over a bottle of the gasoline for my airplane engines. It broke all over everything." Gil and Ellen looked at each other and started for the basement, the children at their heels. Gasoline and old paper! What a combination. "What on earth!" Gil "Wherever did you get so said, many 497 Papers?" He turned to Ellen, "What were you thinking of to let him pile up Papers like that in 4 work room? Gasoline and sparks from the electrical equipment! Either one could burn the place down." He continued to Mutter as he stacked papers and carried them outside. "I tried to tell you," Tommy said, "It's my war work. Every day I took my wagon around the neighborhood and gathered the Papers. The government needs paper, The Toom was getting pretty full and I Was going to ask you who to get to catty them away." "So that is what he does the time he is alone," Gil said. - "Wanders the streets with his wagon, going into every one's house, and carrying Out goodness knows what with the Papers. Bob Mercer said he saw him down on Vine street the other day, but I thought Bob just didn't know the kid. Did you go clear down on Vine Street?" Gil asked. "Well, sometimes I went pretty far," Tommy admitted. Ellen felt terribly shocked. She had talked so much about patriotism. She had tried to impress on him how every one should do his share, but she hadn't made him see that his share was staying at home and keeping out of mischief. He had wanted to do something more, some. Thing that showed up as part of the war effort. "There, I guess that will do for tonight," Gil said. "Tomorrow I?ll call the Salvation Army or the Volunteers of America and ask them to pick it up. I?ll bring home some heavy string and we'll put it all in bundles tomorrow night. We'll all 498 have to work at it. You'll have to hand it to the kid. He certainly did a thorough job. He must have five hundred pounds here." Finally, the ruined dinner was eat. En and 'Tommy in bed, and the older children at their books. Gil and Ellen sat on either side of the fireplace, each with a part of the paper. She had felt too shaken to do any more work.. Gil pulled something out of his pocket. "I think you should see this Ellen," he said, handing her a typewritten slip. Regret to inform you... Teeth in bad repair... Seems nervous > Appears to be caused by malnutrition... Suggest you see a doctor. "Not David, surely? David has always been so well," she said, her eyes questioning Gil. "It was in the mailbox when I got home," he said. "How long has it been since he has been to the dentist?"' "Why, only a few weeks," she said. But had it been only a few weeks? Time had a way of slipping by when one was so busy. She began to go back in her mind. It was when her mother was here, just before she started to work. Why, it had been more than a year! Just as she began to say that she would call] the dentist the next day, the doorbell tang, and Gil went into the hall. He came back with the Stones from next door, and Ellen was busy for a few minutes making them comfortable. "Sometimes I get so nervous reading about the war and listening to it on the radio | just have to get away for a few minutes," Ruth Stone said. You can't get away from the war, Ellen thought. It is just here and it is better to face it. But Ruth was such a silly little thing. It probably wouldn't do her much good to face it. There wouldn't be much she could do about it. "Ruth doesn't like to talk about the war," Jack said, "but in her own quiet way she is doing a swell job of licking it." Ruth was? Ellen looked a little startled. "What are you doing, Ruth?" she asked. Ruth giggled. "You know me," she said, "the proverbial dumb Dora. There isn't a thing I can do." "No?" Jack said. "Well, tonight we had the quarterly weighing and measuring of the small fry and, do you know, in the last three months they have gained more in weight and height than any previous three months since they were infants? If that isn't something in these days of food shortages I'd like to know what is. Four good husky specimens to take over for Uncle Sam when their time comes." Ellen felt Gil's eyes on her, but she looked at her hands folded in her lap. "That's nothing," Ruth said. "It's kind of funny when you think of it. I was worried about all these short. Ages and then Sister Handley came to see me. She said she'd heard I'd majored in foods in college, and wouldn't I share my knowledge with the Relief Society? She gives me a few minutes each meeting. I had to have something to tell them and have I worked? But I took my own advice and it works. There are things you can do that the children don't notice, and they don't realize they aren't getting the things they are used to."
The evening passed in a sort of daze. Too much had happened to Ellen. She couldn't think straight. The next morning she phoned the office that she wouldn't be in until noon. She had to make a dental appointment for David and one with the doctor. There were the things she should have done last night, and a lot of other odds and ends. She'd have to take a half day.
"Are you going to be home all day?" Joan asked.
"Only until noon," Ellen answered, and saw a flash of something like relief cross Joan's face as she dashed out the door on her way to school. Why should Joan be relieved that her mother would not be home all day? Ellen thought about it fleetingly and then was caught up in things to do.
She might as well send Gil's suit to the cleaner. As she emptied the pockets she noticed several sheets of paper covered with notes, and wondered if it were something he would want to keep. She glanced at the top sheet.
"Help wanted," it said.
That couldn't be important. Probably he was drafting an ad to run for help at the foundry. Goodness knows they were having a hard enough time getting people to do the work, with Government contracts and all. She was just about to wad up the sheet when her eye was caught by the next words, "To give personal service in a motherless home. An older woman satisfactory. Must be able to sew on buttons, have house warm for returning school children, and look to safety of a small boy."
That brought her up short and she was fiercely angry. Motherless home, indeed! Didn't she work her fingers to the bone to keep things going. It was more like a fatherless home. Gil did little enough. Wait till he got home. They'd have this out once and for all.
Then the doorbell rang.
Ellen could hardly pull herself together to see who was there.
"Why, Sister Handley," she said, "come in."
"I am glad you are at home," Sister Handley said. "Fern Orainder was arrested yesterday afternoon, and since she is such a friend of Joan's I thought you should know about it, and be prepared to meet Joan when she gets home tonight."
"I never heard of the child," Ellen said. "How could she be a friend of Joan's?"
"They are together constantly," Mrs. Handley said. "They pass my house every afternoon coming home from school, and then Fern goes past again back home just before you get home from work."
"Why was she arrested?" Ellen asked through white lips. She thought her heart would never beat again.
"Things have been disappearing from school right along, and they have been watching carefully. They have never caught her. But yesterday she was discovered in one of the downtown stores with something in her possession that she hadn't bought. Then they arrested her."
"Was Joan?" Ellen whispered.
"No, Joan came to take some flowers to Mrs. Cooke for me. She had promised and she kept her word although Fern had wanted her to go shopping. I had been hearing 500 things about the Onander child and decided to see a little more of Joan. She is such a dear little thing." "Because you were watching her she was saved from trouble that I didn't even know threatened," Ellen said, tears streaming down her face, "and I call myself a mother." She buried her head in her arms. "We all have to do the things we think important," Sister Handley soothed. "I thought my secretarial ability would win the war," Ellen said bitterly. "It is important," Sister Handley said. "You have a position of trust and are doing your work well." "But what good will that do if the next generation are criminals and weaklings? There is no use of saving America if there is no one to save it for," Ellen said in a muffled voice. "But what will I do about my job? Who will they get to carry on? It is important, too. Oh dear, everything is such a mess." Sister Handley thought a moment and said, "There is Mrs. Endor. She used to be a fine stenographer and she is just finishing a refresher course. Her children are married and her duties are very light." "But isn't she quite old?" Ellen asked. "Even the quite old have their place in this war," Sister Handlev smiled. "Her health is good and her fingers are still quick. I think she could work in. Perhaps you could work with her for a week or two." "I feel as if I never wanted to go to the office again," Ellen said. She saw again the words Gil had written, "Motherless home." It was really worse than motherless. She could see that now. If she were not here at all some adjustment would be made, but as long as she made a pretense of taking care of things the family expected her to be there, and to see that everything went smoothly. Sister Handley's voice broke into her thoughts, "We'll work out something," it said. Ellen was at home to greet her tear-stained daughter. "Mommy," Joan cried, flinging herself into Ellen's arms, "the most awful thing has happened." "Yes, my dear, I know. It is too bad about your friend," "She's a nice girl, really she is. She lives in such a funny house and no one is ever there, and she has such peculiar clothes and no one plays with her. I felt so sorry for her I just had to be her friend." Bless her dear, generous heart, Ellen thought. It might lead her into trouble many times, but it would be a blessing to her if she were guided right. Ellen explained as tactfully as she could that it was fine to be pleasant and nice to everyone, but that people were judged by the company they kept, and it might be wise to let mother see her friends and help her choose wisely. "Fern said you wouldn't let her come here if you knew about it, so we must keep it a secret," Joan said. Ellen hugged the child to her. "Now let's get busy and get Daddy a fine big dinner," she said. "In the dining room?" asked. "In the dining room," Ellen answered. Joan "Food Fights For Freedom" Dr. Rose H. Widtsoe University of Utah THE Federal Government, through its various nutrition committees and national leaders in nutrition, in co-operation with consumer committees of the Office of Civilian Defense has initiated a "Food Fights For Freedom" program which it is hoped will penetrate every community and individual home in the United States. As "our boys" are mobilized throughout the world to do their part to "preserve our way of life" so we, on the home front, must do our part to help win the war. This program is planned with far reaching objectives. America's food supply represents perhaps the greatest single potential weapon of the war. It is authoritatively stated that food can shorten the war, save American lives, and help write the peace. In order to accomplish these objectives, we must produce sufficient and of the right kinds of food not only to meet the needs of civilians on the home front; but we must have sufficient to feed our armed forces; enough to meet the needs of our Allies; and enough to help feed the peoples of the conquered countries as soon as they are liberated from the enemy's yoke. There is apparently a general misunderstanding in regard to the food situation. Many of us believe that the shortage of some foods is due to the amount that is being shipped abroad. The latest statistics show that seventy per cent of the food produced by. This country is available for our civilians, thirteen per cent is used by our armed forces, and only ten per cent by our Allies, and two per cent is being sent to outlying territories and to our "good neighbors.": This gigantic task of supplying this vast amount of foodstuffs rests squarely upon each one of us individually. It will take the united effort of every man, woman, and child in this "great land of ours" to reach the goal of sufficient food to meet the basic needs for good health and sound nutrition for all. The question naturally arises, how can I individually help in this important program, "Food Fights For Freedom'? The Government has provided the answer. Let each one of us fit into this program in as many ways as possible: Produce more food of the right kinds. Conserve food, avoid waste. Preserve fresh and perishable foods. Turn food into effective working power by eating the right foods every day for health. 5. Adjust diet to the food available by substituting plentiful for scarce foods. 6. Play fair in buying food?share it cheerfully and fairly through rationing 7. Help keep food costs down by paying no more than top legal prices. 8. Participate in community food projects and inspire friends and neighbors to do the same. 9. Place the war first and expect to adjust to wartime conditions. IN order to mobilize the entire population of our country to participate wholeheartedly in this program, the month of September is being designated as "Food For Freedom" month. Page 501 GROUP... EVERY DAY IN ADDITION TO THE BASIC 7... EAT ANY OTHER FOODS YOU WANT During this month, Federal, state, and county organizations, all women's organizations, all educational groups, public schools, universities and colleges, together with all food producers, processors, and distributors will join in the food crusade to make food fight for freedom. Food choices must not be left to chance. An educational program that will build up new habits of conscious choice, a choice based upon a knowledge of the basic principles of nutrition, is absolutely necessary to "all out" success. Until all people understand and have a firm conviction of the truths of nutrition, our program will be retarded. The National Research Council published the "New Yardstick of Good Nutrition," or, as it is more scientifically known, the "Table of Recommended Daily Allowances for Specific Nutrients." In this table specific amounts of the various nutrients required daily for different ages and different activities are suggested. A more readily available guide to good nutrition is known as the "Basic 7" food groups. In this classification, foods are grouped according to their principal nutritive values. The "Basic 7" food groups are arranged in the form of a chart which will be found in connection with this article. This chart provides a pleasant formula to follow in order to meet the recommended dietary allowances. This does not "FOOD FIGHTS FOR FREEDOM" mean that only foods in these groups should be eaten, but that one or more helpings daily should be selected from each group. Such a diet will include adequate calories, protein, calcium, iron, and the essential vitamins: ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), thiamin (B), riboflavin (G), nicotinic acid (Vitamin A, Vitamin D). After supplying these dietary essentials, other foods, which people usually enjoy, may be added. Such foods will usually add calories but will contribute little to the protein, mineral, and vitamin content of the diet. A brief analysis of the principal nutritive values of the "Basic 7" food groups follows: 1. Green and yellow vegetables eaten raw, cooked, canned or frozen, are a valuable natural source of many vitamins and minerals essential to adequate nutrition. Found in this group are cabbages, carrots, celery, green-leaf vegetables, sweet potatoes and yams, and yellow squash. 2. Oranges, grapefruit, tomatoes, raw cabbage or salad greens contribute also liberally to the vitamin and mineral content of the diet. 3. Potatoes, the main vegetable in this group, contain generous amounts of good quality proteins, iron, Vitamins C and B, and starch for energy 503 apples and bananas are included in this group. 4. Milk and milk products are the most efficient of all foods in making good the deficiencies of grain products and in assuring an adequate diet. It is important as a source of energy, protein, minerals, and vitamins. 5. Meats, including fish, poultry and eggs, are rich in high quality protein which is essential to proper growth and development in children, and for building and repair in adults. Lean meats contain thiamin (B) and riboflavin (G), but are not rich sources of calcium and certain other vitamins. 6. Enriched bread, whole grain flours and cereals are economical sources of energy, proteins, thiamin, iron, and niacin. 7. Butter and fortified margarines are important sources of energy, Vitamins A and D, and important fatty acids. The principal deficiencies in the average diet are calcium, Vitamin A, riboflavin, and often Vitamin C, and thiamin. A diet that provides liberally for milk, also cheese, cream, ice cream, fruits, and leaf vegetables will make good these deficiencies and will insure adequate nutrition. To the homemakers of America? let us accept the challenge, NUTRITION For ALL.

Snow Smith CHAPTER VII SOME years before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and long before the thought had entered the mind of Pres. Young to propose a visit to the "Holy Land," the Prophet said to me, "You will yet visit Jerusalem." I recorded the saying in my Journal at the time, but had not reviewed it for many years, and the, to me, strange prediction had entirely gone from my memory ?even when invited to join the Tourist-party, although the anticipation of standing on the sacredly celebrated Mount of Olives inspired me with a feeling no language can describe; Joseph Smith's prediction did not occur to me until within a very few days of the time set for starting, when a friend brought it to my recollection, and then by reference to the long neglected Journal, the proof was before us. While on the tour, the knowledge of that prediction inspired me with strength and fortitude. Accompanied by several very dear friends, on the morning of the 26th of Oct. 1872, I left Salt Lake City, en route for Palestine. In Ogden I was joined by my brother, Lorenzo Snow, and after an affectionate parting with the friends who accompanied me, we took train for New York via Chicago where we spent one day. In New York we met George A. Smith, the President of our party, Elders F. Little and Paul A. Schettler, our interpreter and cashier, Miss C. Little, my lady companion, who left home before me, to visit friends Page 504 in eastern states. After securing our Passports, we steamed out from N. York on the Minnesota?encountered one storm which satisfied my curiosity to witness "a storm at sea," and arrived safely in Liverpool. On leaving London, our party consisted of six gentlemen and two ladies. We visited principal places in Europe, Asia, Africa, Egypt, Greece, Turkey in Europe, etc., and on our return, after a flying trip among our relatives in the States, my brother and I arrived home in July, 1873. In 1875 I compiled the letters written abroad by Pres. Smith, T. A. Schettler, my brother, and myself, and published in a well-bound book containing neatly 4oo pages of instructive, truthful descriptive reading matter making a respectable and useful addition to our home literature. Since that time, I have published seven books, the last and largest, containing. Nearly 600 pages was issued, and a few copies bound in September 1884. My first Vol. Of poems was printed and bound in Liverpool, Eng., under the supervision of Elder F. D. Richards, at that time presiding over the European Mission. A few years later, | sent the manuscript of the 2d Vol. To the same Office for publication, but through some casualty it was lost, or supposed to be, and was missing until I had relinquished all expectation of it, when it was accidently found only too safely deposited in an obscure till in the Office. I ordered the Manuscript returned. And published it in Salt Lake City? SKETCH OF MY LIFE Our printing establishment having, by that time, 800d facilities for book.

We applied to those who were in Possession of wealth. But the Prospect of early proceeds was not sufficiently Promising for their speculating ambition. But we succeeded in obtaining means sufficient to start the manufacture of the raw material, with simple appliances, to fully test the feasibility of success, Provided sufficient interest could be aroused in this direction.

Vol 31 September 1944 No. 9 Back to School THE month of September is ''back to school" month. How grateful we should be that, even though
our nation is at war, its school doors will be opened as usual and the nation's children will be offered opportunities for scholastic training similar to those afforded in normal times. Our schools, like all other institutions, have felt the impact of the war, but they have managed to
maintain a normal school year, a capable teaching staff, and have offered standard courses of study? in some instances, even accelerated educational programs. Education has traditionally been viewed with veneration by the American public. The development of our school system and the support given our schools on the elementary, secondary, and college levels by hundreds
of thousands of Americans, attest the faith of the people of this nation in the power of the  schools to be of benefit to them. One of the unfortunate effects of the war has been the  interruption in the school training of many of our boys and girls. Some of this has been unavoidable, but, in too many instances, it as been due to our youth and their parents failing to take a long-range view of the importance of scholastic training, and to their yielding to the pressures and inducements of wartime. According to the Page 508 Children's Bureau, thousands of children under fourteen years of age, for whom there is no official count, are known to have left school to work, while high school enrollment has dropped one million during the war and is becoming progressively more serious. The availability of jobs many of which do not contribute
directly to the war effort or to the development of the worker? accompanied by high wages has been the magnet which has drawn great numbers of our boys and girls from the school room, many of whom are working in violation of child labor and compulsory school-attendance
laws, many teen-age boys and girls are children of the depression. They and their parents remember when jobs were hard to get, and they are fearful of a lack of jobs when the war
is over. They feel they had better work while jobs are plentiful and that school can wait. Others believe it is a patriotic duty to leave school and go to work, while still others, impressed with the accent given the war and its related activities, have lost sight of, or have even come to
doubt, the importance of regular school attendance. Latter-day Saints believe in education
and the great opportunities for development and advancement afforded by the schools, and they encourage school attendance. It is realized that economic need and defense labor needs may require some boys and girls to work during the coming year, and that for some young people work experience may have significant education value. It is also realized that for many young people scholastic training beyond the secondary schools may not be desirable or possible. Nevertheless, the vast majority of our youth should be in school.
Parents are urged to take a long range view of the needs of their children. All the education and training they can get will be needed to fit them for the postwar world. Their future welfare and the strength of the nation are in large measure bound up with the wise use of school opportunities. If our children are to be equipped for tomorrow, they should go to school today.
