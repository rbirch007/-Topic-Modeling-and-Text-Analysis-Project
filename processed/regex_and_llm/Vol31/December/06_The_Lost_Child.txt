THE LOST CHILD Alice Morrey Bailey My child is lost, as in Jerusalem A child was lost long years ago. Did his mother's feet, in panic Wildly seek him to and fro? Did she, too, fear evil men? And did her heart so dully beat? Did she, in terror, scan the crowds And call him in the empty street? Did her fingers touch with longing His recent kiss upon her face? Oh, God, I pray that I, like she Find my son in a holy place.
