FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR Dorothy Clapp Robinson Patty Lou Turner had been left to take care of Johanna while the other girls and Niels went to find work. Patty Lou could not understand why Matilda Lewis did so much for them when Ann Kristin had sent her husband to jail. Perhaps Matilda did not fully understand herself. The girls needed a mother, and Jouanna, who was very ill, needed a nurse, and so she gave help, for it was part of the new gospel she had adopted. All they could do for Johanna did not seem to help. Helga and Ann Kristin had sold practically all their lovely things to get help for her and to keep them all eating. Patty Lou didn't try to work; and Niels always fought. Helga often found washings or sewing to do that brought a little food into their camp. Ann Knstin who had a withered hand because of infection from a sliver, had tried unsuccessfully to find work. On her way home she met Matt Lewss, and before they reached camp they were quarreling. Matt did not realize he was jealous over TOM BEDLOE. Patty Lou demanded to know where Kristin got so much food. Before she could answer, they saw two officers coming up the path. Matt warned the girls not to talk. CHAPTER V WATCH your words," Matt cautioned the girls as he saw the two officers approaching. The two men came into the clearing. Matt stood in their way defying them to come closer. "Howdy," he said shortly, as they stopped before him. "I'm Simmons," the first one said, showing his badge. "I've been here before. Remember?" "T am not likely to forget," Matt answered. "Whom do you want this time?" Page 706 Jones, the deputy, seemed to think that a joke. He laughed uproariously. "We want that big Swede that lives here." "Who said a Swede lived here?" Matt stalled. He hoped their voices would reach Niels and Jake. "Come on, come on," Simmons demanded, "we know he lives here. Which one of these doghouses is his?" He started toward the lean to, but Matt stopped him. "Don't go inside. There is a sick woman there and she can't stand excitement. Tell me what you want of Niels and we will try to find him; but don't go in there." Jones spat tobacco juice, just missing Matt's shoe. At the look that came into Matt's eyes, he turned quickly to the three frightened girls. "He's saying that just to keep us out. You Mormons stick like mustard plasters to each other. We ought to run him in for obstructing the law." "I wouldn't advise you to try it," Matt cautioned. "Keep still, Jones." Simmons turned to Matt. "I am not here to stir up trouble, but I am going to have that Swede. If you will bring 'him out, I won't go in. He kicked up a ruckus at the wharf and did bodily injury?." "Since when have you arrested men for fighting? You would have your jail full in one day." Simmon's anger flared. "For a man in your position it would pay you to keep a civil tongue in your head. This Swede stole a sack of FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR food from one of the workmen. I have the warrant all night." Helga stepped toward them. "Niels doesn't steal," she told them indignantly. At first sight of the officers, Ann Kristin had felt a suffocating weight settle over her. Since leaving Loftshammar they had known, more suffering and privation than She had dreamed existed. Now it was here again. If they took Niels away now, it would kill Johanna. The men would not listen to reason. Nor, once arrested, would Niels stand any chance of a fair trial. Only something drastic would stop them. She went to stand before Simmons. Her bonnet fell back. "Niels did not steal that food." Jones whistled. "I have heard that the Mormons have collected all the good-looking women in the country. But I didn't believe it." Matt snatched Kristin and thrust her behind him. Even Simmons was disgusted. "Lay off that talk, Jones. I am sorry." He spoke to Ann Kristin, "Orders are orders." "But he didn't steal the food." She set her chin defiantly and looked at Matt first. Then back to Simmons. "He didn't steal the food because I did." "Don't be ridiculous." barked at her. "But I did. So he will have to take me." The officer scowled. "If you are trying to protect that Swede?." "We were all hungry," she said simply. "I took it from?." "From where?" Matt demanded. "Do you know?" He was still holding arm. 707 "You can tell she is lying." "I am half inclined to believe she is, but I'll have to take her along until I find out." "Then Niels may go free? May stay here with Johanna?" "No. [ll have to take him along, too." "But," Ann Kristin cried, "You said?that is, I thought?." Jake coming from behind the shack interrupted. He was breathing hard, and one hand caressed a rising welt on his chin. "Don't you believe her, Officer." He scowled at Ann Kristin. "She's just trying to shield her no-account brother. The truth ain't in any of them." "Why you?!" Patty Lou seized the basket of food and would have hurled it at his head, but Helga caught her arm. Jake looked at her. "Watch her," he advised. "Who are you?" Simmons demanded. 'Now listen here," Jake's voice rose belligerently. "No one is calling me a Mormon, not even you. I'm not afraid of your badges. Go ahead and call me one. Go ahead and try it." He doubled his fists and started toward Jenkins. "Don't get your shirt off. I didn't call you a Mormon. I reckon you're not. I never yet heard one deny it. We are after that Swede. Hansen. Did you see him?" "Course I seen him. He I'd a had him, too, if you-all hadn't been so loud-mouthed. He high-tailed it into the timber." He waved his hand vaguely. "He give me a nasty crack and got away. "Who are you?" Simmons demanded again. "What are you doing here?" Jake's eyes were insolent. "I'm a hunter," he answered shortly. _ Jones eyed him suspiciously. "What kind of varmints do you hunt?" "Maybe I hunt wolves. Maybe I don't. I wouldn't advise you-all to be too inquisitive. I can take care of myself." "Come on," Simmons told his companion. "Let's get on his trail before he gets away." "But what about the gal?" Jones still had his eyes on Kristin. "She's lying. Come on. Coming?" He asked the last of Jake. Jake shook his head. "I do my hunting alone." The watchers held their breath, but Simmons was taking no chances. He went to the shelter and looked in. Jones peered over his shoulder. Helga forced her way ahead of them. Perhaps it was she, perhaps it was Johanna's white, frightened face that turned them back. They went crashing through the underbrush beyond. When the sound of their going had died, Matt turned and offered his hand to Jake. Before either of them could speak, Patty Lou cried out: "Jake Nichols, you low-down, no account, good-for-nothing. You can tote yourself away from here for good." Matt smiled at her fury. "Thanks, Jake. That was quick thinking. Why do you always help us when you are not one of us?" "What's that got to do with it? Folks is folks, and brother or no, the trick worked." Patty Lou gazed open-mouthed. When the full import of their words came to her, she began to cry. Jake patted her comfortably. "Now, now, Honey. Yourself. He is safe." "I?I thought you-all was a?," a mild sob muffled her words. They all smiled at her vehemence, and Ann Kristin asked, "Where did he go, Jake?" "No place where they will find him. Come on, Patty. Dry your eyes. 'They're getting red and you all will look like a hoot owl with red rings around your eyes." Patty Lou straightened abruptly. "If you-all don't like the looks of me?." "Where's your manners?" he chided. "I have been traveling all day without a bite." Patty looked at him in amazement. " 'Cause you-all's hungry don't mean you can eat around here, but for once we got food enough for a meal." She turned to Ann Kristin. "Did you-all really steal that food, or did Mister Bedloe give you the money to buy it?" "Don't be absurd." Matt spoke harshly. "You know very well she didn't do either." He became conscious of the fact that he was still holding Kristin's arm. He dropped it abruptly. "Tl be going along." "No, no,' ' Helga cried, "you must eat with us, "Do," Jake urged, women fuss me." Helga watched over Johanna, explaining as gently as she could the meaning of what had happened; but she managed also to help with the preparations for the meal. Don't fret "too many HEY sat around a rudely constructed table, and ate sparingly, but talked much. Matt told of  FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR conditions in Nauvoo and his fears for the future. Jake urged him to get a job driving freight teams. Helga rose repeatedly to watch over Johanna and the baby. Patty Lou more than the others enjoyed her food. She was like a child with a bag of candy. In the midst of Jake's story of an Indian attack, she broke in with, "Kristie. Where did you-all get this food?" _ The second time she asked it, Ann Kristin answered shortly, "I bought it in Montrose with money." "Did Mister Bedloe give you the money?" "No." Her eyes darkened with indignation. "Where did you-all get it then? You-all didn't have any money when you left here this morning." The issue could no longer be ignored. They all knew she'd had no money when she left that morning. She had said nothing about working. She thought, they all believe Tom gave it to me. They think I would take it from him. Angry tears blinded her. They could think that of her! She rose hurriedly to go inside, but as she turned Helga caught hold of her shrunken hand. "Ann Kristin. Where is mother's ring?" Kristin tried to put her hand behind her back, but Helga held it firm. 'There was a band of white around her finger where the massive ring had been. They were all watching. She tossed her head defiantly. "It was mine, wanted." "Ann Kristin. Not sure-enough." Patty Lou was horrified. "It had I could sell it if I 709 been in your family over a hundred years." "Oh, how could you?" Helga demanded. "How could you?" Ann Kristin could no longer hold her tears, but she ignored them. Her eyes asked her sister's forgiveness. "I was desperate. I could not get work." "How much did you get?" Patty Lou pursued the subject relentlessly. "How much?" Helga echoed. "Five dollars. He~." Matt half rose, then slowly sat down again. Jake swore. "Why the dirty copperhead. It was worth, at the least, a hundred dollars in gold." "Who got it, Ann Kristin?" Matt asked quietly. At the new note in his voice, she met his eyes. "The gambler-trader, Wilkins, who was on the boat with us. He has a shop at Montrose. It was all right," she added quickly. "I asked him to buy it." "T can't see through it." Jake was plainly puzzled. ""Why should Niels be arrested for stealing food if none was stolen." "There might have been. There is always. A gang of boys playing around the wharf. One of them might have taken it. And Niels was in trouble anyway. The more things they can pin on us the better they like it. It is all part of their scheme to make us get out." Patty Lou was still staring at Ann Kristin. "Why did you-all do it? You sold your ring and bought grits for me. Why?" "You were hungry, too." "I was mighty hungry for some back-home food. I have eaten so many greens and seeds my skin is turning green." 710 Ann Kristin sat back down. "It has been sold, so let's forget it." Her tone put a period on the conversation. THEY ate in silence for a few moments, then Patty Lou spoke abruptly. "T know who took your money out of your trunk." "Patty!" Helga cried "How could you?" "Remember your failing, Young-?un," Jake cautioned. "Don't start something you can't finish." "Let her tell." Matt had been watching the girl's face. He had sensed the struggle going on in her mind, and suddenly he remembered many hints that had puzzled him. "You bother me, Jake. I'll tell anyhow. Mister Tom Bedloe took your money." For a moment they all stared in stunned unbelief. 'Then Helga asked: "How could he? He did not know we had the money." "He did know about it. Told him herself." Ann Kristin was cold with fury. "Why do you say such a thing, I have never told anyone?" "You-all told him," the girl persisted. "You and Helga were talking and you-all said you must go back to your cabin, you didn't want to leave your money alone. You-all said some other things, too." Slowly, memory came to Helga. "T remember that night. We had a long meeting and afterward we wanted to stay on deck and discuss the sermon we had heard. It was shortly after we left St. Louis." "I heard, and I know he heard. I saw the expression on his face. He sharply. Kris went directly to Wilkins and they 'talked a long time. They were talking about it, cause I heard words." Ann Kristin felt the last shred of her confidence slipping, and she fought to -hold it. Tom had involved her in the arrest of Elder Lewis; but he had explained that. She could not forgive him yet, but neither could she forgive Patty Lou for trying to incriminate him in anything so sinful. "That is very poor grounds for such an accusation," she told Patty coldly. "As much grounds as they had for accusing father," Matt reminded her. She could have reminded him she had put off her marriage with Tom Bedloe because of that; but she did not. "T know in my heart he did it," Patty reiterated soberly. "Unfortunately, knowing and proving are two different stories," Matt said, "and in this case we would not have the prejudice of the law with us." "You are being absurd," Kristin cried. "A man, even if he were that kind, would not steal from the girl he intended to marry. He would not unless he was past all honor. Besides, it was my money." "Ts that so?" Matt rose suddenly. "And he is my father. Maybe you are so innocent you don't know stealing that much money is grand larceny. Maybe you have forgotten he has been in that filthy jail for two months, waiting a trial that gets postponed because they know they haven't a real case against him. Maybe you don't know he isn't going to live through another month of it. Tell us the rest, Patty Lou." The girl had risen and gone to
stand in front of Ann Kristin. Her black eyes were snapping. Jake had
never been so proud of her. ?A man would not steal from his sweetheart unless he was past all honor you-all say. All right. I reckon you need more enlightening. On the way down the Ohio, Mister Thomas Bedloe made love to me, too. Only he didn't steal my money. I gave it to him." "You what?" Matt and Helga
barked the words at her. Ann Kristin stared coldly. ?He talked me out of it. I had just one hundred dollars by then. He said he would invest it and give
me back two hundred." ?Has he given any back?? Matt demanded. "No. He?," she looked around uncertainly, "I?d better not tell why." "Talk, and talk fast."
"He gave it to your father." Is that a guessing game, too?? Kristin wanted to know. "That is what Mister Bedloe told me. He said Elder Lewis needed it for the Jacobsen family. That's what he says, and he will pay it back if I will wait."
"But," Helga interrupted, "all the money given to the Jacobsens wasn't a hundred dollars, and we gave fifty. It was all we had beside the gold and securities in the box." "I thought Elder Lewis had kept it, but now I know he was lying. I
have known it a long time, but I wouldn't tell because Ann Kristin took him away from me." During all this, Jake had said nothing. Now he stepped before the
girl, his tall length towering above her. His voice was deceptively calm. "And you-all have had no money?" Patty Lou turned her head, but he jerked her about to face him, "What have you-all been doing all this time? Where did you get your keep?" Even Patty Lou's insouciance withered under his terrible anger. "You-all
stay right here. I am going after Mister Bedloe. I knew he was a snake all the time." Without a glance to the right or the left he strode off through the trees. Matt  hurried after him. Helga went inside the shelter. Facts were beginning to fall into a pattern. Kristin faced Patty Lou. "Was the trader, Wilkins, on the boat coming down the Ohio?" "Yes. Y-es." Patty Lou's eyes
opened wide with understanding, "and he is the one who bought your ring."
"I can't believe it. I just can't believe-." "Neither could I. He pretended
to be such a good saint." Black eyes looked into blue ones with complete
understanding. "It was you-all buying grits and pork that made me see."
Helga came quickly toward them. "Get Niels. Get Sister Lewis. Hurry.? Patty Lou ran, and fear gave wings to her feet. Ann Kristin followed Helga back to the bed. It was too late. Neither Sister Lewis, nor Niels, nor all the doctors in the world could help Johanna. She had already slipped into peace and comfort. As they stared, the baby at the foot of the bed whimpered softly.
