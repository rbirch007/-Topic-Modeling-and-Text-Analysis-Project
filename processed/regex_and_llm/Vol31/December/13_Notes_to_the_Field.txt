Notes TO THE FIELD
Collections by Visiting Teachers Discontinued
THE September issue of the Magazine carried the recommendation of the General Board, which was approved by the First Presidency and the Presiding Bishopric, that visiting teachers should no longer collect contributions from ward members for either the charity or general funds of the Society, effective for the month of October 1944 and thereafter. Since that time some contributions have continued to come in through the visiting teachers because all members were not aware of the change in procedure. Both Relief Society officers and members are reminded that the revised visiting teachers' report book and ward Relief Society record book going into use in January 1945, will have no space for showing receipt of donations to the visiting teachers. It is expected that all members will have become acquainted with the new regulation by that time.
Inasmuch as bishops are now responsible for all expenses incident to assisting those in need, members who continue to offer donations to the Relief Society may be reminded that contributions for the charitable purposes of the Church should be made to the bishop in the form of fast offerings and donations of cash or labor in the interest of the Church Welfare Plan.
The September Magazine also indicates that free-will offerings might be made direct to the officers but this relates to special contributions?not to the donations ordinarily given to the visiting teachers.
For full explanation of the discontinuance of collections by visiting teachers, readers are referred to the Magazine for September 1944, page 511.
