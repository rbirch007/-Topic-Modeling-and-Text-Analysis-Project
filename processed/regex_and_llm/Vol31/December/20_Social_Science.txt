Social Science Modern Applications of Ethical Principles Lesson 5?Truth and Its Perversions Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, March 27, 1945 Lesson link. The world today is in need of a great moral reawakening. Happiness is the main goal of life and the standard against which morality is measured. One of the principles of happiness, and hence righteousness, is personal progression. Progress is made possible through the creative and responsible use of free agency. Many people abuse this moral law of the universe by seeking to dodge and evade consequences, which they cannot do. All of this we have studied in the earlier lessons. Lesson aim. To examine truth as the framework of ethics, and to study some of the ways in which it becomes perverted. Just as happiness is the criterion of morality, progression the major process, and freedom the condition or means by which it is brought about, so truth is its framework or structure. "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32). This basic scripture conveys the very essence of ethics, for it is the freedom from evil gained through a knowledge of truth that brings progression, happiness, and the good life. Truth, then, is the "stuff" out of which morals are built. The Meaning of Truth Probably the most simple definition of truth is that it consists of things as they are, past, present, and future (Doc. And Cov. Sec. 93:24). The universe is full of objects, processes, and relationships that exist  LESSON DEPARTMENT 731 separate and apart from the mind of man. All of these together make up total reality, or total truth as we have chosen to call it.
When truth is utilized in the performance of some act beyond the present comprehension of man, we call it a "miracle"; but as man grows in his understanding of truth, the miracles of yesterday become the commonplace things of today. Intelligence, which is the mastery of truth, is the glory of both God and man.
Although truth is not limited by man's understanding of it, man is so limited, and the progress of man is consequently contingent upon his expanding comprehension of reality as it exists about him. This search for truth may differ in method but its results are always the same?growth and happiness. Whether by the investigation of the scientist, the speculation of the philosopher, or the inspiration of the religionist, if the process leads to truth, it is legitimate and is ethically desirable. A sincere and honest search for truth, together with a courage and zeal to follow wherever it leads is basic in any moral system. Morality is not founded upon falsehood.
But there are perversions of this principle, some of which have already been alluded to in earlier lessons. In the hope for personal advantage, some people do forsake truth and cling to falsehood. It should be obvious that this will get them nowhere in the long run, though they may profit momentarily. To sacrifice others and endanger future happiness for the sake of selfish passing thrills is immoral, for by departing from the ways of eternal truth it defeats the attainment of
happiness through eternal progression. It is to some of these distortions or perversions of truth that we now turn attention.
Willful Ignorance
Intelligence is so central in both latter-day Saint doctrine and secular philosophy as to require mention only. We are told that no man can reasonably be saved in ignorance, and that the glory of God is intelligence. This is all very reasonable, for salvation is a process leading to Godhead, and Godhead is contingent upon the mastery of truth. Ignorance is a vice; intelligence, a virtue.
Ignorance is to be especially condemned when it results from indifference or laziness. Man is free to do as he will, but it is wrong to recklessly deprive oneself of knowledge and truth. Indifference to reality and laziness in its quest are the twin evils back of ignorance. The highest morality involves a love of truth and a passion for things that are right. Willful ignorance is immoral because it is an unnecessary desertion of truth.
The mastery of truth requires a search more than it does a defense, and many err in confusing these two. The moral life is active and progressive, not stagnant nor retrogressive; dynamic, not static. There are too many people today with a defense complex; too many looking for proof rather than truth; confirmation rather than information.
Reasons for this static, and hence, perverted approach to truth are many, but they all center around man's self-interest as he narrowly conceives it. It is easier to hold on and follow than it is to climb upward and lead out, but only the latter will 732 bring results morally desirable. Change and innovation are always disturbing for they require effort and reorganization, but they are the only way to progression. One cannot progress standing still. If man could but realize that the search for truth does not mean the defense of status quo, if he could grasp the forward point of view, if he could be a little more analytic and a little less dogmatic; if man could do these things, truth would be less abused and humanity would be more enlightened and more happy because of it. In the long run, self-interest may require the sacrifice of what may seem at the time to be for our best interest. Failure to make his sacrifice for eternal truth, through doggedly defending vested interests of the moment, is a perversion of ethics. Sincerity in Place of Certainty Although sincerity is a virtue, as will be shown below, it alone is not enough. It is possible to mean well and still be wrong. Truth exists separate and apart from man's understanding of truth, and it becomes man's moral duty, therefore, to be inquisitive and critical beyond the acceptance of authoritative _ statements. Sincerity of statement may fool the uncritical and blind them to errors and fallacies intrinsic in the statement. Knowledge or certainty should be the aim, and satisfaction with anything short of this is a perversion of the good life. Sincerity alone is no substitute for truth, but sincerity with truth is a virtue of the highest order Sclf-deception Sometimes man tries to fool himself by the process of rationalization. Instead of doing what he ought to do, he does what he wants to do and then tries to reason himself into thinking that it was right. This is the wishful or fantasy thinking referred to in an earlier lesson, and it leads only to self-justification, certainly not to truth. Making excuses or justifying oneself in following desire rather than reason so that it appears to be reasonable is merely dodging the truth. And when man does so he only deceives himself. But not for long, for eventually the truth will out and he will see himself as he really is. Intellectual honesty is a crying need of the day. Shakespeare said, "To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man" (Shakespeare, Hamlet: Act I, Scene 3, Line 75). We are sorely in need of men and women today who know how to think straight and who aren't afraid to do it. The tendency to sidestep truth and then to "kid ourselves" about the consequences is at the root of all deception, and is, therefore, an evil of great magnitude. Self-depreciation Another perversion of truth is the tendency, in some, to discredit or devalue the dignity and importance of self in relation to the universe. Sometimes it takes the form of self-abuse and self-torture as with certain Hindu cults. More often it is simply a matter of self-neglect, with ill-health as the result. Frequently it~ expresses itself in chronic inferiority feelings and overly submissive attitudes. Individuality is important in the order of things, and any attempt to discredit it is a distortion of all true values. Health, in both LESSON DEPARTMENT its physical and mental aspects, is based upon the proper application of true principles to the self, and where one's perspective is so warped as to permit willful neglect of himself, he should be considered immoral for this neglect. Likewise, it is important that each person have a proper estimation of himself, not too inflated, to be sure, but neither too deflated. Humility accompanied by a real sense of self-worth and _self-confidence is a virtue, but where devoid of this it results in the perversion of self-depreciation for it means stagnant and _ insipid personalities. Truth should be applied to the self as well as to society, and where the self is neglected or depreciated truth is thereby distorted. Self-glorification But just as self-depreciation is an evil on the one hand, so self-glorification is an evil on the other. What the world needs is self-confidence without arrogance, self-assurance without conceit, self-interest without vanity and selfishness. Confidence admits mistakes when found and starts again on the basis of new discoveries, but arrogance yields to nothing. Self-glorification is a perversion of truth because of the overinflation in self-importance it brings. Closely related to the egotism of self-glorification is the evil of self-pity. There is too much whining and complaining today. Undistorted truth should give each person a proper perspective of himself in relation to the universe, and should make him courageous enough to "take it" without a whimper. Lying The telling of untruths is equally serious with these other perversions, 733 more serious perhaps than some. Lying is willful deception by verbal means, and the liar is not to be trusted. Whether the so-called "white lies" are wrong or not is debatable, but there is no debate on the ethics of lying in general. 'There might be some justification for making a false' statement out of social graciousness, such as saying you like a new hat when you don't really care for it, or of telling an untruth to save someone's life, but aside from unconsequential and extreme cases such as these, there is no justification for lying. Lying is an attempt to escape responsibility and avoid consequences by circumventing truth. Since it is dishonest it leads to distrust. Someone has pointed out that the best thing about telling the truth is that you don't have to remember what you have said, and there is a lot of sense in this statement. A clear conscience based upon honesty and truth is the only way to righteousness. It is better to be trusted than to be loved. Cheating Aside from lying, there are other ways of assaulting truth by deceiving the public, and cheating is one of these ways. Some of the major forms of cheating are as follows: (1) stealing another's property; (2) plagiarism or "literary theft" such as copying an examination or using another's words verbatim in a speech or in a paper as if they were your own; (3) cheating by omission rather than commission; such as protecting or defending the wrongdoer, remaining silent when an error has been made that benefits you, or in other ways taking advantage of mistakes that are in your favor; and (4) 734 showing favoritism or unjustly discriminating against some for the benefit of others or yourself. In all of these practices, truth is perverted for personal advantage, it is not shared equably, and this is cheating. Hypocrisy Artificiality and deception are very common forms of truth distortion. A great many people unfortunately seem to feel that they must wear a mask in dealing with others and never let their real selves and honest intentions be known. They are glib in speech, using flattery instead of sincere compliment, propaganda instead of truth. It must be remembered that pretentions which are out of line with practice do not long deceive. It was Emerson who said, "What you are thunders so loudly in my ears that I cannot hear what you say." Half-truths and truths given out in distorted proportions really add up to falsehood, and anyone who uses these devices to deceive and misrepresent is a hypocrite regardless of the particles of truth he may include in the process. Eulogy is no substitute for analogy and truth; the letter of the law is no substitute for the spirit; going through the motions of righteousness, pretending that you are good, is of no avail unless you really are good. Expediency Much of what has been said above applies as well to the evil of expediency. All of these truth perversions discussed here are interrelated one with another, and all (or nearly all) tie up directly with the spirit of self-aggrandizement ? through expediency. The dictionary defines expediency as that which is "conducive to special advantage rather than to what is universally night." An expedient individual has only the selfish point 'of view and is willing to sacrifice a principle for personal benefit. He is insincere, and, since he lives not by. Principle, he is also inconsistent and unpredictable. He cannot be depended upon nor trusted. To him anything is right that he can get away with; sin comes not from the act itself, he thinks, but from getting caught. He is not genuine. He lacks conviction. Expediency is often rationalized on the grounds of being broadminded. But this is a grievous error for while broadmindedness is a virtue when tempered by conviction, it is not a virtue without conviction. Some people are so broad that they become shallow. What the world needs is men of vision, conviction, and honor; men who are not for sale; men who know the right and have the courage to live it. The only difference between a statesman and a politician, as we use these terms today, is that the one is ethical in his public life while the other is willing to twist truth to his own advantage; the one is moral and the other immoral. Politics is a technique of expediency, and it is _ not confined to the field of government alone. Almost every institution or group has those within it who are willing to cheat in one way or another for their own selfish advantage ?expedients these, politicians all. This misuse of faith and confidence, this betrayal of truth, is at the bottom of most of the world's suffering today. Without it, much of the human misery of the day based on LESSON DEPARTMENT injustice, infidelity, and deceit could not exist. It is to the desertion of truth that most of humanity's woes are attributive. If people were only a little more industrious, intelligent, and dependable; if they were more ready to act out of sincerity, confidence, and conviction rather than hypocrisy and personal expediency; if they were a little more genuine and honorable and less prone to lie and cheat; if truth could reign, in other words, this would be a far better world in which to live.

The lesson next month will be very closely related to this discussion. It is suggested that unsettled questions or problems be carried over to next time with special assignments, perhaps, on points that need to be looked up. Special reports could also be assigned on the influence of the home and the church upon character formation.
