BETHLEHEM THE BLESSED Alice Whitson Norton There is a city strange and old, Hemmed in by fields of grain, Dust on its quaint, old, battered walls, For centuries has lain. Yet, ever in its pulseless heart Remains the secret deep, "T'was here the wise men first beheld God's infant Son asleep. "Twas here angelic hosts appeared Above the bare old earth, To broadcast with a loving voice, The blessed Savior's birth. And where that blessed baby lay, Tonight the stars smile down, A silent benediction on This well-remembered town.
