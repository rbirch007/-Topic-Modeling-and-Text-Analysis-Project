115th Semi-Annual Conference Elder Joseph J. Cannon First Assistant General Superintendent in the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association THE famed autumn weather of Salt Lake Valley was at its best during the three days of the 115th semi-annual conference of the Church, October 6th, 7th, and 8th. Those admitted within the gray walls of 'Temple Square found it an island of beauty. Due to the restrictions of travel, this was again a Priesthood conference—leaders of stakes, wards, and quorums, mission presidents of continental United States, Canada, and Mexico, and general boards of men's auxiliaries. 'There were seven regular sessions, including the Priesthood meeting Saturday evening, and two separate meetings Friday evening for Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood leaders. Each session lasted two hours. The music was mostly congregational with appropriate male solos, but on Saturday evening the male chorus of the Tabernacle choir stirred the great audience, and Sunday morning the full choir made the customary broadcast, the 795th, and sang for the Columbia Church of the Air program. All of the regular sessions, except Priesthood meeting Saturday evening, were broadcast over KSL from Salt Lake City, and KSUB from Cedar City, and the Sunday morning session over KFXD at Nampa, Idaho. Thirty of the thirty-one general authorities were present, Elder Alma Sonne, Assistant to the Council of the Twelve, filling a call to Hawaii. A spirit of gravity pervaded the gathering. The men had come when traveling was difficult and time very precious, some of them suffering bereavement through war casualties, and practically all filled with anxiety for sons or brothers in the service. President David O. McKay conducted the meetings. The outstanding event of the conference was the appearance and address of President Heber J. Grant. 'The hearts of the men of Israel rejoiced to see their leader in his accustomed place. His message, read by Elder Joseph Anderson, had the typical clarion quality of President Grant's sermons, stirring the saints to repentance and activity, and it had a remarkable comforting influence as well. In faithful parents whose children have not followed in their footsteps, the President revived hope: There comes to mind an experience in connection with my brother, Fred, after our father died. Because of the mistreatment of a stepfather, and neglect, as a young man my brother ran away, and J was told by Brother Mariner W. Merrill, at that time bishop of Richmond, Utah, that the night after my brother ran away, he, Brother Merrill, went to bed rebellious. And that night, so Brother Merrill told me, he had a dream in-which he saw my brother in all kinds of wicked company in many different states, and he saw that a light surrounded him. In the dream he said: ""What does that light mean?" And a voice answered: ""That is the influence that a faithful, God-fearing and God-serving father can have over a son to keep him from going astray, and to eventually bring him back to the truth." Years later when my brother did come Page 699 700 back and joined the Church, as I related here last conference, he fulfilled Brother Merrill's dream, because Brother Merrill said that he saw him laboring all over the Church, bringing wayward boys to a knowledge of the truth, and he did labor from Canada to Mexico in that service. To those who have suffered the death of loved ones, President Grant offered sympathy, telling of his own bereavements and the sustaining power of the Lord that had come to him. The President's address also contained a plea for the clean life, a theme which became very strong in the following discourses: I want it understood that the use of liquor and tobacco is one of the chief means in the hands of the adversary whereby he is enabled to lead boys and girls from chastity. Nearly always those who lose their chastity first partake of those things that excite passions within them or lower their resistance and becloud their minds. Partaking of tobacco and liquor is calculated to make them a prey to those things which, if indulged in, are worse than death itself. And the President sounded another of the conference themes with his appeal for prayer: I have little or no fear for the boy or girl, the young man or the young woman, who honestly and conscientiously supplicates God daily for the guidance of his spirit. I am sure that when temptation comes they will have the strength to overcome it by inspiration that shall be given to them. I am convinced that one of the greatest and one of the best things in all the world to keep a man true and faithful in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, is to supplicate God secretly in the name of his Son, for the guidance of his holy Spirit. The head of the Church of Christ invoked blessings "upon Israel and upon all honest men everywhere," "all the men and women who preside in all the stakes of Zion throughout the Church, in all the missions, in all the quorums of the Priesthood, and in all auxiliary organizations," and on "every man and woman who is laboring for the salvation of the souls of men and keeping the commandments of God." May he bless our youth away, and us at home, and give his direction to the leaders of nations, and speedily bring about the accomplishment of his purposes. May he bless you, one and all, and every honest man and woman that lives upon the face of the earth. PRESIDENT J. Reuben Clark spoke of another matter that was frequently referred to by subsequent speakers, that of preparing for the return to the men from the service —spiritual postwar planning. Our children have gone out into the battle fronts. We have sent them out as" boys, as children in experience. We are going to have them back as premature men who have undergone trials of which we know nothing. Some will return, we hope most of them, triumphant over temptation and sin, seasoned in righteousness and courage and everything that goes to make a man of God. Some, however, are going to come back wounded in spirit, with questions in their minds. What are we going to do with them?... What kind of homes are we going to have them come home to? Will they be homes of contention, of discord, or will they be homes of patience, charity, of righteous living, or homes of confidence and of love and respect for their fellowmen? Are we going to bring them back into Latter-day Saint homes and then nurture and rebuild them until they get back to normal spiritually? This is a bit of postwar planning that we can do now. Seek the spirit of the Lord, ask his help, that our families can live righteously and be prepared for these boys when they come home. 115TH SEMI-ANNUAL CONFERENCE President David O. McKay gave a stern warning that there will be continuing war on the earth if we do not overcome the evils that brought on the last two world conflicts. He pleaded for the spirit of justice and brotherhood. After all the suffering, after all the destruction of human life, shall we be so blind as to have it start all over again? If the germ of hate is permitted to develop, if strong nations strive to dominate the weak as Mussolini did to Ethiopia, as Japan did to Manchuria; if the few ruling nations mighty in the implements of warfare, seek to dominate weaker nations and tell them how to live and what to do; if they seek success only in materialism and shut their eyes to the value of human souls; if they reject the teachings of Christ and pursue their selfish interests, history will repeat itself and the world will be plunged into another war, and again the Lord in pity and sorrow will weep over the folly and blindness of the human race. It was estimated that ten million people listened to the choir broadcast and Church of the Air address. The latter, by Elder Ezra T. Benson of the Council of the Twelve, set before America the Lord's promise, recorded in the Book of Mormon, that this is a choice land and will be free from bondage and captivity and from all other nations under heaven if the people will but serve the God of the land, Jesus Christ. Every session was filled with practical suggestions for better living with spiritual incentive. Some of these follow: It is not plain how God hears and answers prayer, but he does. Through adjustment of quotas, we will receive a much larger number of chaplains in the armed forces. California has grown from a weak mission to strong stakes and populous missions. 701 The golden rule should show the way in professions, politics, and all phases of life. All should struggle to co-ordinate belief and practice. There is wonderful virtue in work, without which faith is dead. - God cannot be found by study alone. Salvation by government is delusive. The duty of the Priesthood is to cultivate the souls of the Church. Better dead than alive unclean. The plan of God is here to fertilize the fields of the Church. Young Latter-day Saints are bearing arms to the number of 70,000. Settle problems through the Holy Ghost, righteous living, thinking, and prayer and the counsel of the Authorities. Do away with the madness of pleasure. There is no question so important as religion. Joseph Smith invaded economics, science, and spiritual fields, and time moves toward the proof of his teachings. Prayer will not avail much if we do not repent of our sins. The gospel plan has many fields of activity, and we should follow the program of the Church. Make a habit of reading some thoughtful matter fifteen to thirty minutes a day. Learn to think for yourself. Patriarchal blessings should be sacred to those who receive them. This conference has been
