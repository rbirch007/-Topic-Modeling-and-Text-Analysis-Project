The Spirit of Christmas Elder Mark E. Petersen Member of the Council of the Twelve What does Christmas really mean? Brushing aside all the worldly traditions and the customs made as it should be viewed, and what do you see there?  You see the beginning of an earthly mission with but one intent— to
bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. You see the Jehovah of the Old Testament, the Creator of heaven and earth, born into this world as the Son of the Father of us all, the only begotten in the flesh. You see the Son of
God ushered into this world to overcome death and to provide a plan of salvation whereby each one of us may be saved from his own sins. You see the beginning of a ministry which eventually was to go into all the world, to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, accompanied by a universal cry, ''Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." That is what Christmas means. Are we willing to accept it on that basis, take it into our homes and permit its heavenly influence to pervade our lives? We have embraced the customs of man, with respect to Christmas. Are we as willing to embrace the real spirit of the Christ, and follow his bidding? What is the true spirit of Christmas as we should understand it in the light of the above definitions? First, there is the joy for the life
and mission of Christ. This was expressed by the angels on the first Christmas day. That joy has come down to us through the ages, it has spread over the world as a gift of heaven, allowing sinful man, for one day at least, to gain a slight taste of the happiness that might be his always if he would accept it. The
spirit of Christmas is a spirit of joy. The spirit of Christ brings joy, such
is his intent. Man is that he might have joy, and joy comes through service to the Almighty and to our fellow men. The next expression of the spirit of Christ as given us in the New Testament story is that which we read in the incident in the temple, when, as a twelve-year-old boy, the Christ talked with the learned doctors there. The expression to which we refer came when his mother
chided him for his absence: "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" That is part of the spirit of Christ, a part which too few of us remember, at Christmas time or any other time. If we will but enter the true
spirit of Christmas, and make it a part of our lives, we will ever be 676 "about our Father's business." There would be little of the spirit of worldliness about us; there would be none of the waywardness that characterizes so many who profess to follow him; there would be none of the indifference with which so many people regard their religion; and none of the criticism of his Church and his authorized representatives here on earth. Rather, we would be working diligently in his kingdom, we would be earnestly supporting the program of his Church, and would sustain with our works those who direct his affairs in mortality. Were we truly "about our Father's business," which indeed is characteristic of the spirit of Christ, we would remember to keep the first and great commandment: to love the Lord our God with all our heart, might, mind and strength, and our neighbors as ourselves. We would think of that love in terms of service, very much as set forth in the Doctrine and Covenants, "see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day." Another expression of the spirit of Christ is the spirit of humble obedience. This was displayed at the time of his baptism in Jordan. Although he was the Son of the Highest, although he made heaven and earth, he walked the humble path of obedience to the side of a man "not worthy to unloose the lachet of his shoes," and was baptized of him. Humility is one of the greatest of human traits. It is divine. It is characteristic of every true follower of the lowly Nazarene. It is representative of the spirit of Christ, in whose honor we observe Christmas. But with it goes obedience to the practice of the Church. Was Christ sinful, that he needed baptism? He was without sin. Yet he obeyed "to fulfill all righteousness." Can we do less if we truly follow him? The next important index to the spirit of Christ, as it appears in the New Testament story, is his resistance to temptation. Though Satan himself appeared to him, offering him the riches of the world if he would but succumb to his wiles, the Christ stood firm and true, never letting down the standards, never losing sight of what is most valued, never forgetting the pearl of great price. He resisted temptation, although he was in the midst of it. He retained his cleanliness and his purity because he turned his back upon the defiling influence of the adversary. It took character, yes, but he desires that we all have strong characters, he asks us to resist evil, he desires us to be clean. "THEN he gave the Sermon on the Mount, and with it the teachings of stability, mercy, love, and kindness. He taught men to give, for it is more blessed, than to receive; he taught them to regard all men as brethren and even love their enemies. Another doctrine at which some have scoffed, yet which, if followed, would take away much of the hatred and bitterness in the world, was taught—the doctrine of turning the other cheek. Likewise was forgiveness portrayed to the people. What, forgive one who offends us? Yes. How many times, seven? Yes, even seventy times seven. That, too, is the spirit of Christ. It was that spirit he carried with him to the cross, THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS when he cried out, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Faith was another important mark of the spirit of Christ. He taught it in all he did, he plead with his followers to believe, he sorrowed at their unbelief. With this teaching came his appeal for repentance. Turn from your evil ways, practice righteousness, was his appeal. "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." That was his goal for us all. Nothing was too high of attainment, not even perfection, and he urged men to seek it, unafraid. The spirit of prayer is the spirit of Christ. He not only taught men how to pray, but he prayed with them and for them, and one of the important things for which he plead was still another factor in the spirit of Christ—it was for unity, that his disciples might be, one, just as he and his Father were one. Discord has no place in the true spirit of Christ. Then, there was the spirit of resignation to the will of God. Each one of us sometime must make a choice between his own desires and the will of God. Each one of us must some day learn to say, "not my will but thine be done." This was the attitude of the Lord in Gethsemane. It, too, is part of the spirit of Christmas. After his triumphant resurrection, he exhibited still another quality which is part and parcel of the spirit of Christ—and Christmas—the spirit of missionary work, sharing our blessings with others. "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel unto every creature." To the house 677 of Israel alone? Not at all. To the Gentiles? Yes, to every creature. It is our duty to warn every person, even our closest neighbors, that the "kingdom of heaven is at hand." Spread the glad tidings, invite all to drink of the well of living water and thirst no more, to join the banquet of the King, to join the fold of the Good Shepherd, accept his plan, work out salvation in fear and trembling, and endure to the end. Then it shall be said, "Come ye blessed of my Father, enter into the joy of your Lord." It is so easy for us all to become engulfed in the ways of this world, in the customs of man, and make of Christmas just another holiday of feasting and pleasure. But if we observe the true spirit of the day, we cannot exclude Christ and his mission from it. Christmas is celebrated because Christ came into the world, and he came to save us from death and sin. He offers the way by which we may once again come into the presence of God. Christ means salvation; salvation requires acceptance of the gospel; acceptance of the gospel means activity in the Church.. To be truly Christ-like then, is the reward of a true Christmas. So at this glad Yule season, let us renew our allegiance to him who was born in Bethlehem, crucified on Calvary, and came forth again as the living Savior and Redeemer of mankind. And with our allegiance to him, let us be loyal to his representatives on earth, and his plan of salvation as expressed in the program of the Church. Let us honor Christmas by honoring Christ, which means serving him and keeping his commandments. A Few of Our Gifted Utah Women Artists Alice Merrill Horne Former Member of Relief Society General Board ~Alice Morrey Bailey — The sculptor suffers a tremendous handicap for a gift to help sculp is of small account without a knowledge of anatomy. The expense of the sculptor’s material is far greater than that of the painter. It is comforting to know down the ages a few men possessing what we call genius (like
William Shakespeare for example) were able to achieve all for which greatness is intended, in spite of environment, in spite of everything. Alice Morrey Bailey, Utah sculptor, seized opportunity by the forelock, and forced it to do her bidding. Alice persistently worked her way into the anatomy class of the University of Utah Medical School, even though she determined to make art, and not medicine, her life profession, Those who Opposed gave praise when they recognized the use she put to the anatomy which characterized her beautiful sculptures. Mahonri Young, the international sculptor, wont to discourage students of sculpture because he knows its tremendous handicaps, when he saw Alice Bailey’s work, said, “I would like you for a student, come to New York. "The Challenge" a study from her own dear son and a cherished piece of sculpture, was given to the Ella Quayle Van Cott Vernal Central School Art Collection by the writer. It reveals wonderful child-quality, The Douglas School Parent-Teachers made a generous gift “Of Such is the Kingdom” another lovely piece of modeling by Alice Morrey Bailey, to the very choice Douglas-Howell Robenbaum collection. THE ETERNAL UNIT Viola Hale Curtis has painted “Winter in Salt Lake Valley” which 
was the writer's gift to Snow College, Ella Quayle Van Cott Memorial Art Collection. UTAH WOMEN ARTISTS 679 —Viola H. Curtis OBERHANSLEY BARN IN SPANISH FORK CANYON A lover of design would be repaid by a study of that Curtis painting. The row of hillside trees reveals a dozen or more tiny pictures between trunks of trees and boughs, as well. There are charming spots of lights and darks. There are cool colors against warm tones. In the Olympus Louis Heinzman Collection which hangs in the Snow College Library, is "Oberhansley Barn in Spanish Fork Canyon" by Mrs. Curtis. Autumn foliage casts its protecting shade over the pioneer barn. Though the barn is the main theme, every tree and bush and stone is placed to add its mite to the whole ensemble—a distinguished water color to which B. F. Larson has given praise. Mrs. Curtis has also painted the "Mormon Trail to Nauvoo." Elsa Erickson Saxop's parents were high-bred religionaries—Scandinavian converts to Mormonism. They met and married in Utah, and made their home in the mountains. Two daughters and two sons blessed the union. Before Elsa, the eldest, was fourteen, her dear mother passed on. In three more years her father died. She took up her mother's, then her father's duties, and great were her responsibilities. 680 Sure, faithful, serene, Elsa kept the children together, the four went through school successfully, and she brought them into safe waters. They rise up and call her blessed. Elsa ''found" herself in the art class at West High with J. T. Harwood as instructor. Later, Mary Teasdel was also an inspiration to the young girl. When both teachers were abroad, Elsa
came to the writer with sketches for advice. Elsa Erickson became the wife of a Swiss, Eugene Saxod, whose interest in mountain climbing persisted in Utah. Week-ends found the Saxod's searching for sketching grounds among our mountain lakes and canyon streams. Elsa's lovely paintings are often seen at Zion's
Co-operative Mercantile Institution with the Utah Art Colony exhibitions, where a buyer is waiting for each canvas. Although a great artist, her first interest is  in her charming home. An art collection is named for her in the Blaine School,
Salt Lake City. At the moment, she is painting portraits of her gifted
Daughter (One of Elsa’s pictures is seen on the cover of this issue of TheLucy Taylor Andersen — The November-December Zion’s Co-operative Mercantile Institution Tea Room Show of paintings contains thirty water colors by Lucy Andersen, who is among the young artists. The two mediums, oils and water colors, are quite differently handled. Pictures, in oil, will permit repainting several times. Not so water colors, which should be painted
with a splash in a flash, as it were. However, each splash should be made with skill and with a view to securing a special effect. This watercolor skill requires quick, intelligent decision, coupled with a degree of bravery almost to the point of rashness — the paper should be wet but once with paint. It is sure to make mud to repaint a water color. Examine Lucy's thirty landscapes to mark the frankness, directness, boldness of this young artist’s brush work, which as the earmarks of style. Style which is inborn— never acquired by an artist. For once everything is favorable to an artist’s career. Her interested husband, Waldo Andersen, wishing to further her career, has purchased oils for his
wife to try a new medium for her pictures; her son is a devoted admirer.
The mother and son go sketching together. Besides, she is the daughter of the artist, Rachel Grant Taylor, and her grandfather, President Grant, has promoted several generations of artists. Irene Fletcher — It is an honor to be associated with so gifted an artist as Irene Fletcher, the wife of an artist, Calvin Fletcher, head of the Utah State Agricultural College Art Department. Herself a loving
mother to her own children, she has been equally tender of the children
whose mother died long before she married Professor Fletcher. The
writer imagines the Irene Fletcher who would be backed by her home
State, and supported with means from sales of her own paintings. Then much of the work that has so crowded her young days could be dispensed with. Were Irene
Fletcher supported as her gifts deserve, she might become even greater than a national figure— a world painter. Mrs. Fletcher's works are seen to advantage in the Logan High School Ella Quayle Van Cott collection. Minerva Kolhep Teichert —
muralist of biblical subjects, pioneer life, wild life, and western themes, was born in Ogden, Utah. Her father, the son of a wealthy German Jew, ran away from home and was drawn West by a passion for Buffalo Bills Wild West, and
visited Utah where he remained. Minerva's mother pushed a handcart
to the valley. The Kolheps moved from Ogden to a ranch near Old Fort Hall by the Indian Reservation. Minerva's gift to paint developed rapidly under her father's
direction. Her young life became saturated with such things as Indians,
pioneers, wild life, and the Bible, and it followed that the Western art student took fast strides at the Chicago Art Institute. Irene Fletcher PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG GIRL There, she paid her way drawing cadavers for the medical students all the
while perfecting her knowledge of anatomy which is also all-important to the muralist and figure painter. Minerva Kolhep won two free scholarships at the Art Students League of New York for her draftsmanship, awarded by Robert Henri.
The young girl came home to a dying father. She married a rancher, Richard Teichert, and it was her lot to take part in the varied and fascinating
activities of a large Wyoming ranch. Minerva, a brilliant conversationalist
and eloquent speaker, converted her husband, Richard Teichert, who now serves in the bishopric in her hometown. They are parents of an intellectual daughter
and four sons who, as types of cowboy philosophers, ride the range and take courses at the Brigham Young University.  A BOWL OF "CHRYSANTHEMUMS” Florence G Smith These stalwart youths
observe, strictly the Word of Wisdom. Their interests in art, music,
and cattle raising, sports, and religion are apparent in their conduct of
life. South High School in Salt Lake City owns a fine collection of murals by Minerva K. Teichert which hang in the library. Perhaps no other high school in the country has a finer original collection of western life. There are ''Captain
Bonneville and the Trappers," Indian women's basketry and pottery making, and wild life subjects. Minerva and Laurie, the daughter, have recently returned from a painting trip to Mexico. Mrs. Teichert's new murals will be seen at the Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution exhibitions. (One of her paintings
is used as the frontpiece of this month's Magazine.) Florence Grant Smith — gifted daughter of President Heber J. Grant, is a water colorist of charm.
She has a strong personality evinced in her direct and sincere method of
painting, and has good selection of subject. Florence creates a home
life of charm, and her leadership in Relief Society work will be remembered.
Florence's marriage to Willard Richards Smith, a man of lofty integrity and fine taste, has been an inspiration and a source of strength to both. The two Grant artist daughters and granddaughter, are students 683 UTAH WOMEN ARTISTS | 683

of the eminent water-colorist, Joseph A. F. Everett. VERLA BIRRELL, art instructor at the Brigham Young University, is often dubbed "globe trotter." Every summer this ambitious artist travels and paints. Verla has visited Europe, Africa, and South America, the East, and West, for subjects. She is not only intellectually endowed, not only possessed of a lofty attitude of mind and heart, but she goes forth with a certain openness to inspirations which come with new contacts, new themes, new environments, which she makes her own in her pictures. Her water colors are strong, and virile. Her criticisms are well directed and illuminating to her art students. (To be continued)
