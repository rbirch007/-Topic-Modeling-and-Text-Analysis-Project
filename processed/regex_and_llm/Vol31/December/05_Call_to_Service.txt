CALL TO SERVICE
Gertrude Petty Stanton
This is the time to summon all The inner strength each heart must hold; That valiant steadfastness recall To service, as new charts unfold.
This is the time for song that brings —Remembering all that life holds dear— Fresh courage to the one who sings And high resolve to those who hear.
This is the time for love that brins From inmost sources in its flow; No cloud of hate its brilliance dims— Our sons are priceless—tell them so!
This is the time for hope, not fear; For vision far beyond the rod, Beyond the cross that irks us here To stronger, purer faith in God. [Page 2]
