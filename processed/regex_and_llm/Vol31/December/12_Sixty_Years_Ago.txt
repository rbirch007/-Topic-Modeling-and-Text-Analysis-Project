Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman’s Exponent, December 15, 1884 “THE RIGHTS OF THE WOEN OF ZION, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOEN OF ALL NATIONS’ Christmas. Editorial There is no holiday in all the Year With so many endearing recollections, SO many charming reminiscences, such tender associations, and altogether Such wonderful fascination hanging over and around It, as Christmas. It is the day of days, with the children more specially when they expect all Sorts of gifts and treasures. No wonder the children love the day, it is the time most prescient of good to the, and to all mankind. The birth time — the sweet and touching story of the Savior's birth
never grows old, no matter how oft told. Christmas Eve! when the selfsame stars that guided the wise men of Bethlehem shine down upon us, and we feel such a holy presence, such a reverential awe, as though angels were hovering near, and with glad songs of rejoicing were echoing back from the ages past Hosannahs to God in the Highest; Peace on earth and good will to all mankind. How the human heart clings to those words divine with their answering aspirations. How they lift the soul into a higher region of thought and feeling. And the little ones partake the spirit of the day and interpret in their own simple but eloquent way every expression of sentiment and fancy that is uttered or felt by the older people. . . .Sometimes fortune divides the family circle, and for a time some one is missed of the loved ones who helped to make the chain complete; but if only absent for a time "on pleasure or on business bent" — it is not right to murmur or wear a brow of sadness, for "to be parted in body is not to be estranged in soul — and many a dream — and many a vision may pass before the mind of one whose lips are silent." There is one thing all should do at Christmas time, if they wish to emulate the Savior and do honor to "the babe in Bethlehem born," and that is, to remember the poor, and out of the substance God has given to each, donate liberally to those less fortunate — let none go cold or hungry on that day, lest their cries should enter into the ears of the
Lord of Sabaoth for a testimony against those who heed not the injunction: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, ye have done it unto me."

A Reverie: If there is anything that is really comforting when I want to collect my thoughts, and peer far into the future, or call up a vision of the past, it is to sit in the dusk of evening, or when the rest of the household have retired, all alone in a dim shadowy room in front of a grate full of live, red coals — sit and dream, wide awake, O such delightful dreams! though tinged with sadness. Imagination, however, must be vivid and the moon must be decidedly reflective. The mind can wander away then even into green lanes, where one hears merry voices, and sees troops of boys and girls, and their laughter rings out so clearly that it makes me start, and although I sit here by the fire in
bleak December, I feel the warmth of the sunlight and see the blue sky overhead, and I see many, many curious and familiar places and people; in fact I dream so long that I wonder whether I am my real self, or if the morning will find me going about my accustomed duties. What thoughts spring up and resolve themselves into such real substances, as to almost take on shapes of things, unseen, and yet to the mind tangible. We feel and know that the heart beats still, that we are sensible to feeling, therefore this must be only a dreamy phantasy, a reverie, but we can see things that are not, yet things that were. . . .
