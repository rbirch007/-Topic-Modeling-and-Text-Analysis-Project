Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes Lesson 6?Blessed Are the Pure in Heart Elder Bryant S. Hinckley For Tuesday, March 6, 1945 Objective: To show that the pure in heart are those who walk uprightly and work righteousness, and their rewards are realized both in this life and in the life to come. "BLESSED are the pure in heart:. For they shall see God" (Matt. 5:8). This great promise made by the Savior is confirmed, and the conditions upon which its fulfillment rests are more fully explained in the Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 93:1: "Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that. Every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am." Jesus tells us that purity of heart leads to a knowledge of God. A perfect knowledge of God is to be attained only by a consecrated life. We read in Psalm 15:1-3: "Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour." And again, Psalm 24:3-4: "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully." Again in Psalm 73:11: "Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart." President Brigham Young tells us that the prayer of the pure in heart will have more effect than the eloquence of Cicero?the simple, honest heart is of more avail with the Lord than all of the pomp, pride, splendor, and eloquence produced by men. The heart is the source of action, the seat of the moral life. Purity of heart means more than physical cleanliness; it means, in addition, uprightness and goodness of soul. "As a man thinketh in his heart, so he is," and, "Out of the heart are the issues of life." The blessings promised in this Beatitude are finally to be realized beyond the grave, but observance in this life brings a rich reward. LESSON DEPARTMENT 727 Literature New Testament Lesson 6?The Acts of the Apostles Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, March 20, 1945 LIKE The Gospel According to St. Luke, The Acts of the Apostles, generally ascribed to the same authorship, is primarily historical literature. In this record ? addressed, as was the preceding book, to a Roman leader, Theophilus?we are given a stirring account of events following the death and resurrection of the Savior. In Acts, the heroic carrying forward of the work of the Master, the spreading of the gospel not only to the Jews but to other peoples, is vividly portrayed. One basic difference in structure marks the Gospel of St. Luke from its sequel. In the former, gospel teachings of the Savior are inwoven with the historical text; in Acts, gospel discourses given by the apostles, particularly Paul, are, in the main, to be found in the Epistles. A study of these Epistles from the literary viewpoint is reserved for the next lesson. In essence, The Acts of the Apostles is an evangelical epic. It is made up of a series of stories linked together in natural sequence, portraying the rise of the early Christian Church under heroic missionary leaders. Stunned at first with the tragic passing of Jesus, his faithful disciples remained bewildered until, lifted by his resurrection, they saw more Clearly the divine meaning of it all. Then came from their risen Lord this sacred calling and commission: But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8). After this, when Jesus had been, "taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight" (Acts 1:9), the disciples, with his mother Mary and other women, communed together in prayer and supplication. Matthias was chosen to fill the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles left vacant when Judas betrayed the Savior. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing, mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other. Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance (Acts 2:1-4). People roundabout, hearing the strange commotion, gathered. In the multitude were devout men, Jews out of many nations. And they 728 were amazed?confounded at hearing these inspired Galileans speak in a language each could understand in his own tongue, of "the wonderful works of God." Some of the listeners mocking said, "These men are full of new wine" (Acts 2:13). But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said... For these are not drunken, as ye suppose,. -. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; In words of inspiration Peter goes on to bear his burning testimony, and to say: Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now, when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.... Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls (Acts 2:36-38; 41). Here is stirring drama to divine purpose: the portrayal of an event that has helped to shape the spiritual destiny of the world. Observe how the story moves, how it rises in climax, how it is kept centered around Peter, the principal character, who, with fiery zeal, rises to leadership in carrying forward the work of the Savior. Note also the simplicity, the directness with which the author helps the story to tell itself. - Mark, too, the artistry in the choice of words with which inspired translators have kept the story alive, picturesque, and convincing. "With one accord," "rushing mighty wind," "pricked in their heart," are illustrative expressions (See Acts 2). Naturally this successful launching of the great missionary work was a challenge to the enemies of Christianity. As the band of brethren and sisters grew in numbers, and carried forward, "with gladness and singleness of heart," the opposition waxed fiercer. Persecution, however, was only a spur to the devout workers in their labor of love. Onward they pressed in the spirit of Christ, ministering to the poor and the sick, even performing miracles in his name. Threatenings and imprisonment did not daunt the apostles and their humble followers. Martyrdom only strengthened their determination and faith. Another of the well-known stories, from Acts, that of Stephen the Martyr, portrays the persecution of the disciples of Christ at its height. It reveals also the devotion of these early Christians as they braved the fury of the Pharisees and other enemies of the followers of Jesus. Haled before the high priest on false charges of blasphemy, Stephen more than answers his accusers, and boldly charges them with always resisting the Holy Ghost as their fathers had ever done. LESSON DEPARTMENT "Which of the Prophets," Stephen asked, "have betrayers and not this sin to their charge, when he had said this he fell asleep" (Acts 7:55 ff). Thus, Praying for those that had Persecuted and despitefully used him, the first martyr of the mission. Ary ?ta passed to his Teward. Yet, the truth he Proclaimed did not die; indeed it was nourished by his blood and quickened by his Christlike spirit. And one of those who participated in the cruel killing?Say} of Tarsus?through a dramatic turn 729 Jerusalem, And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: And he fell to the earth, and heard a Voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why Persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou Persecutest; it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks, And he. Trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee What thou must do. And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but see. Ing no man,; And Saul arose from the earth; and when his yes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. In that city, the sight of Stricken Saul was finally restored. More than Master said, "he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel." Thus Saul of Tarsus, became Pay brought humbly into the fold of Christ. In succeeding chapters of Acts, the rest of the life story of this great evangelist is told. In his Epistles (to be studied later) is preserved some of his masterful interpretations of the Privileged to bear the Master's name "before the Gentiles and kings"; for he carried it even to Athens, seat of ancient culture and to Imperial Rome. Discussion and Activities* 1. Why may the Acts of the Apostles be called living history? 2. Why also may it be described as an evangelical (or missionary) epic? 3. What literary qualities do you find in each of the stories reviewed in this lesson: "The Day of Pentecost"; "The Stoning of Stephen"; "The Conversion of Paul'?... 4.
