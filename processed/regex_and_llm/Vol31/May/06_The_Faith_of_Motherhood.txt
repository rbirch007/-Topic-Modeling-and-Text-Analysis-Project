THE FAITH OF MOTHERHOOD Ann Young Hughes Her window frames A golden star tonight, And valor wreaths a hero with its light. She marked the star That guided him from birth Through joyous years Of sweet disordered mirth, And does not cry Because he found a nobler way to die. Twin agonies of birth and death have swept All laughter from her lips, but she has kept The faith of motherhood, Because her son Competed for a golden star—and won. Lissa’s Song Mary Ek Knowles WHEN Lissa North walked up on Sharon's front porch, Sharon and Eunice quickly hid something behind them and sat very still on the porch swing, their faces flushed, eyes gazing at the ceiling. Then Sharon saw who it was. "Oh, it's only Lissa!" she laughed and brought out the vanity scarf
she had been embroidering. "We thought it was my mother. Eunice sighed with adult exasperation as she bent over the last rambler rose on a pillow case. Eunice was red-haired and thin-faced. She talked in a high shrill voice. “Tomorrow is Mother’s Day, and this my last chance we have to finish our mother’s presents…” Lissa saw Sharon nudge Eunice, but Eunice chattered on, " . . . have we had a time. To keep them from finding out, I mean. You know how
mothers are, Lissa, and ..."Lissa stood quite still before them, a slim, brown-eyed girl in a plaid dress, thick dark braids hanging down her back. Sudden remembering was a sharp pain that made her face go white beneath the sprinkling
of f reckles. Last year she had given mother a sampler. All done in cross stitch, God Bless Our Home. She had gone to grandmother's every day after school to work on it. Daddy had framed the sampler, and mother had hung it in her bedroom. ''I want to see it the minute I open my eyes," she had said, “It is so beautiful, Lissa!” Sharon took a cookie from the picket of her dress and held it out. Lissa read sympathy in her blue eyes. "Here's a cookie, Lissa. It's
got nuts in it.” Lissa siad, “Oh, thanks, Sharon!" She sank even white teeth into the cookie and it was like cotton in her mouth. "Are you going to sing in church tomorrow?" Eunice scarcely paused for breath between sentences, "Gee,
I wish I had a swell voice like yours. You can reach all the high notes. I can't even sing above E'. And you can hit high C just as easy. Which song are you going to sing, Lissa?" "I'm going to sing, 'Little Mother.' " Lissa thought, I must sing because I promised mother I would. But can I do it? Tomorrow she
would see the front benches filled with mothers all smiling and pretty in their new spring hats. Only her mother wouldn't he there. There would just be daddy sitting by himself. Would the notes stick in her throat! What if she should break down and cry before them all! Tomorrow was the day that was to have meant so much. "Mother, they have asked me to sing a solo for Mother's Day program,"
she had told her mother that day. How very long ago it seemed! "And I'd like to. But I just couldn't. I’d be so frightened.” Mother had taken Lissa in her
arms and her blue eyes had been tender. "Frightened! Nonsense. You are going to sing that song, you are going to stand up there and let everyone hear what I hear in your voice. I'll help you learn the song. We'll practice every day. And
you'll give a real performance. 264 Promise me, Lissa. No matter how difficult it is, that you will sing— for me on Mother's Day." And Lissa, catching her mother's enthusiasm, had promised, "Ill do it, Mother. I will!" But that had been almost two months ago. And since then— tears welled up within Lissa, and she held her breath until the tears settled in a soggy lump in her chest. When you were twelve, you were a young lady and you didn't cry every time someone looked at you. You ran and skated and played hard until you were so tired you didn't have time to think, and you fell asleep the moment your head touched the pillow. And you pretended. You pretended that mother was away on a trip, that you and daddy were staying with grandmother until mother came back. But tomorrow there would be no pretending. Tomorrow was her day and she wouldn't be there. Suddenly, with an intensity that was frightening, Lissa wanted to go to her mother, to stand by her grave and talk to her. She could not bear to stay here, trying to act as if everything were all right. She said, “I’ll see you later, Kids." She walked down the steps and up the street half a block to grandmothers house and opened the front door. She walked through the rooms calling, "Grandmother!" There was no answer. She remembered then that grandmother had gone to town. She listened for daddy's restless pacing in the room above, but she heard nothing. She was glad. She couldn't bear to talk even to daddy right now. She went into the dining room to get her red purse off the buffet. The thought came to her that grandmother's house was nice. It was big and substantial and quiet with a scrubbed, polished stillness. But it wasn't home! All at once there in the high-ceilinged room with its dark woodwork and_ starched lace curtains she longed for the house on Hilltop Drive with a longing that brought quick tears to her eyes. She missed the silver poplars, and the view of the city at night from the living room windows. Oh, she wanted to go home! We could hire Mrs. Taylor to keep house for us. Lissa's heart beat faster. Then I could have my own room, and I could listen to the radio programs without having grandfather say, "I'm reading my newspaper, Lissa. Turn it off." And I could get my lovebirds, Romeo and Juliet, from Aunt Grace. Grandmother's tabbycat would eat them here. And daddy would have his library of books. Maybe he'd study and go on with his work. And things would be almost as they used to be. Lissa's heart slowed its beating. She shook her head., It was no use. Daddy wouldn't go back. The day of mother's funeral he had turned the key in the lock, and he'd taken the key and thrown it as far as he could into the valley. They had come here to live. And daddy had changed so. For days at a time he stayed in his room, and when he did come out, he just sat in the big leather chair in the front room, his shirt soiled, with no tie, and his face needing a shave. He seldom went out, and then he drove his car too fast. And many times Lissa would waken in the night to hear daddy pacing back and forth. Lissa knew what people were saying
