SO MUCH TO DO Grace M. Candland Please stay an hour longer, Father Time, There is so much to do. A helpless child At home is needing me. The hedge grows wild With thorns. The pansy bed, now in its prime, Cries out for care. The canyons call again, A poem still unwrought lies in my heart, The world bids me arise and do my part To lift its fallen ones and ease their pain. How short the day till sunset's glowing urn Will gather to itself the days of light And leave behind the darkness of the night But give to me no promise of return. Today is mine, let every moment be A glad response to tasks of charity.
