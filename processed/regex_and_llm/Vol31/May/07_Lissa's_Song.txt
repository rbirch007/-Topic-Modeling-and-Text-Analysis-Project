LISSA'S SONG "Oh, yes," they said. "Paul North is brilliant, all right. He has the makings of a great lawyer, but he's unstable. Look how he has gone to pieces since Anna's death. Always did Say she was his back bone. Paul North is finished, washed up!" Lissa knew that wasn't true. Daddy was smart and wonderful all by himself, It was just that daddy had been so very much in love with mother, and her death had been so sudden. If only daddy can get over this bad spot, Lissa thought, he'll be all right. Someday he'll be a great statesman just' as mother dreamed he would be. Lissa wrote a note telling grandmother she would be back soon; she took her red purse and left. She missed the bus. In her eagerness she could not wait for another one. She broke into a trot, her long braids bobbing up and down, and then she slowed to a fast walk, her breath coming fast between her teeth. It was almost a mile to the cemetery, and by the time she reached there it was early evening and her legs ached from hurrying. She stood for a hesitant moment before the Open gate with its archway of wrought iron that said, "SHERMAN City CEMETERY," and she remembered that other time she had been here—a cold day in March and the long line of cars, headlights shimmering in the rain. Now she walked slowly through the gate and the only sound was the wind as it blew through the trees that bordered the main toad. Lissa raised her head. Silver poplar trees. Had been her mother's favorite tree. "Listen, Lissa," 265 "the poplars are telling a story." "What are they saying?" "Can't you hear? Listen! They are telling the Story of a little girl who was afraid of the dark. Imagine being afraid of the dark!" Then mother would tell the most wonderful story, all about this little girl. And as Lissa listened she could feel the warmth and friendliness of dark. Ness. Or the story would be about a little girl who cried when things went wrong. Strangely enough the little girl was always very much like Lissa. Lissa winced. Again remember. Ing was sharp Pain. It would come upon her suddenly, Piercing the numbness. Lissa walked deeper into the cemetery. This was like a city with a main street, and avenues, and street signs and everything. A city of staves. Mother lives on Third Avenue in the middle of the block. She stood by her mother's grave, the red purse clutched tight in her hands, "Mother," she called softly. She listened hard for an answer. That last night mother had promised, "I'll never leave you, Lissa. Never!" But she had, she had. "Oh, Mother, Mother!" The white marble headstone swam before Lissa's eyes. There was no answer but the wind wailing through the poplars. Lissa lifted her head and her breath caught in her throat. All about was a stillness that grew and grew until she could hear it in the pounding of her heart. Dark shadows lengthened and stood waiting. Lissa brushed the tears away with a trembling hand. "Mother!" The name was a frightened whisper now, The trees moaned, "She's dead, Lissa... She can't hear you..." Lissa turned and ran Out of the cemetery away from the shadows, and the stillness, away from her mother. When she reached grandmother's house, the lights were turned on. Lissa opened the front door. Grandmother called from the kitchen, "Lissa, is that you?" "Yes, Grandmother.'' There was the odor of food cooking, but Lissa
wasn’t hungry. She wanted to go to her room, and shut the door. Then the door at the top of the stairs opened, and daddy came down. Lissa stood and watched him.
There was a bronze bust of Thomas Jefferson in the Public Library. Somehow Lissa always thought of daddy when she looked at it. But daddy didn't look like  Jefferson now. His eyes were blurred, his face was unshaven. He held to the banister and his step was not steady. “Lissa!" He took her in his arms.
Lissa turned her face from the smell she had come to hate. ''Where have you been? I’ve been half crazy with worry!" Daddy's arms about her were tender.
Lissa looked up at him. She wanted to tell daddy where she had been, she wanted to tell him what had happened, but there was a look in daddy's eyes, sort of as if he already knew where she had been, as if he had been there himself. Lissa smiled a stiff little smile. ''Oh," she said, "I was just over to Susan Huxley's." Sometimes you had to tell a lie, a little white lie. And the organist’s name had been the one she could think of. "Are you going to sing tomorrow, Lissa?" daddy asked. Oh, no, Daddy! she wanted to cry, I can't do it! I promised mother I would sing for her on Mother's Day, but she won't be there, she
can't hear me. I can't do it. I can't. Daddy seemed to read her thoughts, and he smiled a crooked, funny, little smile as if he were saying we’re no good without her, are we Lissa? Why try? Lissa thought, maybe daddy wants to go back to our white house, maybe he wants to be a great lawyer like mother wanted him to be, but maybe he can't do it, anymore than I can sing. But maybe— the thought held her like a steady hand— maybe if I could sing, then maybe daddy...."Why, of course I'm going to sing." She held her chin stiff to keep her lips from  trembling. "That's what mother wanted me to do. I promised her I would." Daddy took hold of her face with his big hands and he looked into her eyes. "If you can do that, Lissa, if you are a child, can you stand up there…” His voice choked off. He turned and went slowly upstairs. THE chapel was crowded and
brightly decorated with ferns and spring flowers. There was that low hum of voices like bees in the sun that always precedes a service. Lissa sat on the first bench next to the open window. Her white pique suit was freshly laundered, her dark hair had been brushed until the thick braids shone glossy in the sunlight. Lissa held the printed program tightly in her hands, and she half turned her head. It was just as she had known it would be, the front benches in the center section filled with mothers all smiling and dressed in their very best. Always before, Lissa had loved Mother's Day. She had glanced over at her mother and thought, that's my mother. The most beautiful one of all! Lissa turned quickly away now and looked out the window, a hurting pressure in her
throat. Outside was a garden, tulips, hyacinths, and a row of silver poplars. Lissa tried to hear a story in the murmur of the leaves, but there was no story now, just wind in the trees on a May day. She said to herself the words of the song she was to sing: Little Mother, Mutterchen, There's no other, Mutterchen,
Although I know that we are far apart, Nothing can take —Hot tears stung her eyelids. In that moment, she knew she could not sing those words, not with
mother dead! She would slip out the side door, now, before the services began. She half rose in her seat. She saw daddy directly across from her on the other side of the chapel. His face was clean shaven, and he was wearing the white shirt and maroon tie that had been mother’s favorite. Against the light, he looked almost like the bronze bust of Jefferson again. Lissa sank down weakly on the bench. The hum of voices died. Susan Huxley played a short prelude. The services had started. There was quiet as Brother August stood to offer the opening prayer. Lissa looked at the program in her hand. Her song was first on the program. Lissa bowed her head and closed her eyes. She was cold with a coldness that chilled her body and made her teeth chatter. Brother August always offered a long prayer. This was her last chance to steady herself. She said a little prayer of her own, Please, God, help me— help mc to sing my song well. Please— for daddy’s sake.: As she prayed a feeling of warmth stole over her— a  protecting warmth. As on a cold rainy night when she was safe in her bed with her knees doubled up and the wool comforter over her. But this— this warmth was
deeper than that. And there was a sound like the steady beating of a heart.
The steady beating faded into a whispering that was like the wind in the silver poplars. ''Lissa!" she seemed to hear a soft voice call. Lissa's heart pounded. It sounded like her mother's voice! 'Lissa!" Again she heard the sound. 'I’m here, Lissa . . . Here . . . You can't see me, but I'll never leave you, Lissa .... Never . . . ." Lissa opened her eyes, her heart beating so loudly that she was sure all must hear. Outside was the garden and the wind in the trees. Brother August's deep voice was the only other sound. All this was as before. But now Lissa felt her mother's presence, and suddenly she understood. Only her mother's body was dead. Her spirit still lived. Always it would be near her, loving and protecting her. And someday— someday, she would be with her mother again! Lissa felt music swell within her, the notes golden and full. Now she
knew she could make daddy understand! She knew. The prayer ended. Lissa stood
before them all and sang, and in her song was the eternal story of mother love, and the resurrection and the life. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, May 1, and 15, 1884 "THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS" Deseret Hospital, Salt Lake City, April 5, 1884. To the Honorable, the Executive Board of the Deseret Hospital: Ladies: Anticipating that during this present season, other responsible duties will necessarily demand much of my time and absence from the city, I deem it wisdom, and do herein tender my resignation as President of the Deseret Hospital Association. Yours respectfully and lovingly, E. R. Snow Smith At a meeting of the Executive Board of the Deseret Hospital, Saturday, April 12th, the President's resignation was accepted.... And we take pleasure in acknowledging our appreciation of her faithful and diligent labors for the establishment and prosperity of that benevolent institution. M. Isabella Horne, Ch. Ex. Com; Phebe Woodruff, Marinda N. Hyde, Bathsheba W. Smith, Jane S. Richards, Romania B. Pratt, M. D., Ellis R. Shipp, M. D., Elizabeth Howard, Emmeline B. Wells, Secretary. Editorial Notes: 'The present number [May 15] of the paper closes the twelfth volume of the Exponent. As the years have rolled by the paper has gradually increased in popularity and influence, as well as in its subscription list. During the past year and a half some serious difficulties have opposed the financial interests of the paper. In January, 1883, the bursting of the water pipes in the Council House destroyed the Editorial Office and much of the furniture, as well as valuable books and papers to a considerable amount. In June, the fire that destroyed the Council House destroyed all except the desk containing books and a few other things.... There has never been a time when so many sample copies were sent for from all parts of the civilized world, as there has been during the past few months.... Items from Oakley.... We are located on Goose Creek, a tributary of Snake River, and have a thriving settlement.... We had a Relief Society organized here September 24th, 1882, by Apostles Lyman and Smith, with the following named officers: Sarah A. Snedaker, President; Louisa Haight and Janett Whittle, Counselors; Prescilla Worthington, Secretary; Breta Felt, Treasurer.... By the proceeds of a picnic party, given by the Relief Society, and other donations, we have been able to send twenty-five dollars to the Logan Temple.... Ex Re Ke Items From Manassa, Colorado.... We Saints in this valley are enjoying good health, with few exceptions. Apostles B. Young and H. J. Grant have paid us a visit.... Almost four years ago, the first meeting I attended in this place was held under a shed, there being only about a half dozen small houses here then. The scene is changed now. We have plenty of good, comfortable houses, although not very nice; a comfortable log meeting house, though it is already too small, especially at conference times. We have a most creditable school house, which, I believe, cost about $1,400, nicely furnished with patent desks, blackboards, maps, and a first class school teacher.... Bro. John Morgan is greatly beloved by the people of this place, he having been the messenger to bring them the glad tidings of salvation in their native lands.... The Relief Society is also progressing. There are many good, faithful sisters here, who are willing to do their duties at all times.... Samantha T. Boice Page 268
