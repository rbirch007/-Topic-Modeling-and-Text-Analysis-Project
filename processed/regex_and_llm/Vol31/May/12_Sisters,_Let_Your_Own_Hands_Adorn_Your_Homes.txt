Sisters, Let Your Own Hands Adorn Your Homes" ?BRIGHAM YOUNG William R. Palmer THE recording of history in needlework is not a new idea. It is as old as painting and old-er than printing. The Egyptians used the art and some of the oldest English history is preserved in tap-estries done by the needlewomen of the King's Court. So when Miss Alice Palmer decided to bring out her fam-ily traditions and hang them on the wall of the family home, her idea, new perhaps to this day, was not original. This decision made. Miss Palmer stirred up the members of the house-hold to a search of the family rec-ords and stories and history. She, like every other person, had two lines to search, her father's and her mother's. When an interesting bit of story was discovered she drew an illustration of i t to scale on quadrilled pa-per. In this manner, she charted scores of characters and events in the lives of the two families. Her father was William R. Palm-er, son of Richard Palmer, who was first of the Palmers to come to Utah. Her mother was Kate V. Isom, daughter of George and Alice Parker Isom, who were pioneers to Southern Utah. The Isoms were English while the Palmers were Welsh. The preliminary sketching all done, the next step was to select out of those many colored plates the figures from the two families that would keep her proposed wall panel in balance both as to figures and colors. The materials selected were a very light-colored tan monk's cloth for the background, and best-grade, fastcolored wool yarns for the figures which were to be worked into the panel in cross-stitch. The panel is four by six and a half feet. Sometimes af igure done in a certain color combination was picked out and done over in another color to attain a more artistic balance or color effect. Both the Palmers and the Isoms were early Latter-day Saint converts in Great Britain. They came here for the Ghurch, and thus the Church the Palmers helped to build in Zion became the central motif of the picture. This is an almost perfect picture of t he old Tabernacle in Cedar City that stood where the Federal Building now stands. The figure in the center at the top is a copy of the Palmer coat of arms. The Palmer name also originated in a religious movement, the crusades. Those who went to the Holy Land and came back bearing palms were called "The Palmers." Thus Palmer became a surname. As stated before, the Isoms were English and the Palmers were from Wales. The flowers at either side of the coat of arms are the Tudor rose of England and the daffodil of Wales? -the national flowers. The second figures down from the Page 279 REREAD LET YOUR OWN HANDS ADORN YOUR HOMES top represent a sailing vessel and an ox team. These were the modes of travel by which both families came to Utah. These figures stamp both families as pioneers. Unfortunately, the white does not show well in the photograph so the full symmetry of the sails on the vessel is not brought out. Below the sailing vessel is the old Palmer home in Cedar City, and opposite that and under the ox team is the Isom home which was built down on the Virgin River. After the families went through the first hard stages of pioneering, these were the first real homes they built in Zion. Under the Palmer home stands the original Palmer with his staff and palms, dressed in the costume of the crusader. Beside him is the typical Welsh grandmother with her aprons and high beaver hat. Opposite these stands a musician waving his baton. Beside him sits his wife, Ellen Douglas Parker. The, contains a letter that she had written in Nauvoo one hundred years before. When Heber C. Kimball first carried the Gospel to England, he preached in a church in the little town of Clithero. John Parker was the choir leader in that church and he and every member of his choir were converted. This man and woman were the grandparents of Mrs. Palmer. Below the choir leader is a cart with a mule driven by a woman. That woman was Alice Parker, a girl of fifteen, on her way to Dixie. After the Civil War broke out, cotton could not be bought in the East but 28) it was very much needed in Utah. Experiments proved that it could be grown in the valley of the Virgin River. Colonists were then sent by the Church to go there and raise cotton. John Parker was one who was sent to Dixie. He loaded into the big wagon all the family effects that it would hold, but there were still the soap barrel and the tubs and buckets which must go, He owned a cart and a little mule and had a fifteen-year-old daughter who could drive the cart, so they loaded the unsightly cargo into it and Alice, the daughter, followed behind the big wagon. The mule was a friendly little creature that turned into every gate they passed and stopped for every boy who hollered "whoa." It was a great embarrassment to the girl and so the story lived and came down to her granddaughter Alice, who perpetuated it in the family panel. Opposite the mule and cart is a man on a horse following a pack of hounds. He was Henry Thomas Rees, grandfather of the Palmers. He inherited some money in Wales, rode to the hounds, and followed the races all over England. One day he came home and told his wife that they were penniless. He had lost everything he owned. He was prepared to see her weep and storm, but instead, she calmly said, "Well, Harry, that is the best word you have ever brought home. Maybe now you can settle down and do something worthwhile." Repentantly he did settle down and a few years later the Gospel gathered the two into its net. They came to Utah, settling in Cedar City. The house in the center below the church is the Palmer home in Cedar 282 City, the home in which this panel was made and where it now hangs. The figure in the lower right-hand corner represents Alice's father seated at his desk talking with a commercial traveler. The other characters represent his pioneer and Indian hobbies. The figure in the opposite corner reveals from what Mr. Palmer rescued Mrs. Palmer. The boy in the back seat rising up to pull the pigtails of the girl in the front gives a realistic touch to this schoolroom scene. "Look out, little Willie, for the school ma'am wields a wicked willow." In the upper left-hand corner is a figure marked AP. This represents Alice, the girl who embroidered the panel. She majored in textiles and art at the University of Utah. At the bottom of this figure will be seen a pair of scissors and above the handles, a spool of thread. The scissors are cutting into a piece of cloth. This represents her major. In the center is a beehive and behind it a snow-capped peak. The Bee Hive work was her major Church activity. At the time of her death, she had supervision, under the General Board, of Bee Hive work in five Southern Utah stakes. The snowcapped peak was her personal Bee Hive symbol. Alice was the oldest in the family. Next in point of age was William I. Who is represented in the Opposite upper corner. "Bill," as the family call him, was in government work and traveling all the time. The suitcase became almost symbolic of him. He majored in agricultural economics. Alice put for him a head of grain in a book because she said he farmed by the book rather than by the acre. At the bottom center under the home is an artist's palette and brushes marked EP. This represents Eugene who majored at Logan in art. Above the school ma'am is a figure labeled RIP. This was Richard who at that time was majoring in political science and public accounting. These were his books and ledgers and pen and ink. Opposite Richard and below the man on the horse is the youngest brother's symbol. Rodney at that time was in high school. He had not yet specialized so his major interests were tennis and the girls and his books and pencils. This explains the meaning of every figure in the panel. It is the work of a beloved daughter who is with us no more. She-designed the border as well as the figures. It is a decoration of surpassing beauty that catches the eye of every person who enters the room where it hangs. Because it portrays our family history it will be a priceless heirloom as long as it endures.
