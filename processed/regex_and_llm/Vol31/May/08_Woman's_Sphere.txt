Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon THE French diseuse, Yvette Guilbert, has died at the age of seventy-seven. Dressed in appropriate period costumes, she sang ancient and mediaeval French folk songs and ballads. She had imitators, but, though entertaining, they never achieved her high artistry. She performed in the old Salt Lake Theatre, and many who attended still remember that evening as one of rare charm. DOCTORS Margaret Brenman and Robert P. Knight have worked out a new kind of hypnosis treatment for insanity. With it, they recently effected the cure of a seventy-one-year-old woman who had a very stubborn case. She remained under the hypnosis for seventy hours. In six months there has been no recurrence of the malady. N an article "Women of Malta" in the March Harper's Bazaar, Teresa S. Colt tells of the courage of the women of that Mediterranean isle which was "battered, broken and wrecked" in 2000 bombings by the Germans and _ Italians. Architectural monuments and 28,000 homes were demolished. The women dug out new habitations beneath the cliffs, and despite the scant supply of water, kept them clean and neat. The Honorable Mabel Strickland did not miss printing a single edition of her two newspapers—English and Phoenician—in which she published Reuter's telegraph dispatches from all parts of the world, and gave the people local news, "encouragement, praise and even laughter." MRS. ANNE O'HARE MCCORMICK, who as a member of the editorial board of the New York Times helps to shape the policies of that eminent newspaper, is one of the few successful women foreign correspondents in America. She has met, interviewed, and written about Mussolini, Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt. N Great Britain, Ninette de Valois, English choreographer, is largely responsible for the transition of ballet from Russian to English direction. At the death of the great Russian master, Serge Diagheliv, people felt that ballet in Britain was doomed. But with some others, Ninette, one of Diagheliv's stars, stepped into the breach. The English girl introduced ballet into the Sadler's Wells Opera House in London, where it soon vied in popularity with the operas. Even under war conditions, the high artistic quality of the ballet has not deteriorated. Two of Miss de Valois' outstanding successes are based on Biblical themes, "Job" and "The Creation of the World." (Britain Today, February.) Page 269
