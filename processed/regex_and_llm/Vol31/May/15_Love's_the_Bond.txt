LOVE'S THE BOND Merling Dennis Clyde You find your Mother's Card among the rest, And wonder, Dear, when you have never known The rhythmic beat of heart beneath your own, Or reaching arms imploring you to nest A small tired body close against your breast. Yet you with mother-love have made it known That actual birth is not the test alone To crown a mother high among the best. Through contacts with your soul, so many, blest In sympathy and understanding tone, Prove Love's the bond to draw them as your own. The very hunger in your heart expressed Inscribes your name, unconsciously unfurled; You, too, become a mother of the world.
