This I Know To Be True Leone G, Layton And I say unto you, if my people observe not this law, to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify the land of Zion unto me, that my statutes and my judgments maybe kept thereon, and that it may be most holy, behold verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you—it shall not be a land of Zion unto you—(Doc & Cov. 119:6)260 THE land of Zion has always been a place of peace, a haven of refuge to the Latter-day Saint. There dwell the "pure in heart," those who love the Lord and desire to do His will and keep His commandments; there, in very deed, is a place where a mother may bring up her children under ideal conditions that they may be the recipients of the blessings every mother desires for her children. All through scriptural history we read of the struggle of various peoples to attain this desired land, the place that should be Zion unto them. Some have gained it, but many have not had strength to follow the directions, and so have failed. In the directions given us in our day, we read that the observance of the law of tithing is essential in the gaining of this Zion, the place where the pure in heart may dwell.
It has been my observation that in most cases those who take pleasure in conforming with this law are those who have been taught it in their homes in early childhood, those whose mothers have been believers and doers, who have taught it to their children straightly and solemnly. It is such an easy law to teach children. There are no "if's," no "but's" to trouble childish minds—just one-tenth of what you earn belongs to Heavenly Father for His work. The unlettered child can comprehend that. Heavenly Father is very close to most children. His blessings very real, and His protecting arm very near. They will gladly give unto Him His portion, if provided with the opportunity by their parents. There are so few things here on earth that one can teach positively to children, and say, "This I know to be right, and this I do." Here we know absolutely that if we are giving our Father opportunity to bless us, He is bound by law to do so. Perhaps the greatest blessing that can come from tithe paying is the knowledge within that we have complied fully with one of Father's commandments in return for the great good we have received from Him.
I have known mothers who have thoughtlessly deprived their children of this blessing. Oftimes we hear of needless friction between husband and wife on this very subject. One wife who had been brought up in a home where this principle was strictly believed and practiced, married a man who had not had this advantage. They started on their rosy road to happiness like all young couples, sure that it lay ahead for them, but soon debt reared its ugly head, babies came, and responsibilities grew. The wife was troubled; she could see no way out, and the thought was constantly on her mind that they were not giving of their means to Heavenly Father, so how could they ask His help with the necessary faith.261 THIS KNOW TO BE TRUE Father, so how could they ask His help with the necessary faith. She tried to have her husband see the thing she believed, but each time, just as she left she was making progress, his mother would say, when he spoke of the payment of tithing to her, "Oh, I don't think the Lord expects you youngsters to pay tithing. You are paying for your house and are so far in debt." So they go on, getting further and further in Heavenly Father's debt. If that mother realized what she was doing in that home, she would be horrified. True oneness cannot be in any home where husband and wife are not in accord and where that which should bring them closer together becomes a barrier between them. There is always the consciousness of one subject that cannot be agreed upon. The influence of parental teachings does not stop with one home, but reaches through the generations. What misery for any grandmother to know, that through her omission, her grandchildren are being brought up in an atmosphere of controversy on this important question. The greatest testimony to me of the rightness of the commandment of tithing comes in observing the lives of those who comply with it. Contrast the picture of the family mentioned above with another family who has a feeling of absolute security in the blessings of Heavenly Father. I have heard the father of this second family bear witness, time and again, that though they had absolutely nothing to start with, reverses and sickness at times, yet through the payment of honest tithes they had never felt actual want. The children of this home have been taught the commandments of the Lord from their earliest youth; and no one can be in their company without partaking of the peace and serenity of their absolute faith and trust in the Lord. Recently this family decided that because of the great blessings that had been given them, the father should fill a mission, bringing to others the opportunity for eternal joys and satisfactions such as they had found. LATTER-DAY SAINT parents are told very definitely their responsibilities regarding the teaching of their children. "They must teach their children 'to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord'" (Doc. & Cov. 68:28). How can we teach our children to "walk uprightly before the Lord" if they have not been taught to observe His tithe? We all know from experience that those lessons learned early in childhood stay with us long. The child whose mother has taught faith and trust in the Lord through the payment of tithes will always remember her teachings, no matter what he does; they will remain in his mind. Other valuable lessons come to our children as companions to this law. They learn the joys of giving, of knowing that through their efforts others may be blessed. They know they have helped build the church and meet its clear pride in it is great duty and they will help keep it clean. They learn to plan the spending of their money, to keep the tithe for the purpose intended, and to be thrifty. They learn the value of organization; that working together, people can accomplish great works. The fruits of tithing are well worth cultivation. 262 Heavenly Father tells us also of parents who are not pleasing unto Him. He says He is "not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them; and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness" (Doc. & Cov. 68:31). We know that the land is not a land of Zion unto them. The greatest satisfaction that can come to any mother is to see her children striving to live according to the light of the Gospel, to know that their feet are planted firmly in the path of righteousness, to know that they can go forth among those whose beliefs and practices are different from theirs and stand firmly upon the principles they know to be true because they have tested them and found their worth. She enjoys peace of mind even in troubled times because of the purity of her children's hearts. What mother could be so shortsighted that she does not early provide opportunity for her child to test and find for himself the worth of paying his tithes. What mother wants to know that because of her lack of teaching, her child can never know Zion, the refuge of the pure in heart? Let us gain this testimony for ourselves and teach it to our children with such absolute conviction that they, too, can stand firm against the powers of darkness, saying, "This I know to be true, and this I do!"
