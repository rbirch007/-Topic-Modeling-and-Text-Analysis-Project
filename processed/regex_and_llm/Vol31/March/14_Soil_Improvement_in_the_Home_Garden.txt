Soil Improvement in the Home Garden Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, Deseret News IN garden making, be it Victory or flower gardening, the condition of the soil is the most common complaint of the amateur. It is safe to say that more grumbling is done about poor soil than any other garden deficiency, with less done to remedy this number-one problem. The home gardener will spend goodsized sums for purchasing the newest rose bush, but not one cent for? yes, you have guessed it?soil improvement! Beginners actually expect to find that perfect, loamy soil all ready and waiting for their light touch to awaken and bring it into a magical full production, but alas, few ever find such a happy state of affairs. Yet, we go merrily on putting in large and extensive flower beds and Victory gardens, and neglect to first examine and consider the betterment of the soil in which we plant. Many pseudo-garden lovers allow poor soil to be the alibi which excuses their own shabby home grounds, contending that their neighbor's beautiful flower garden and bumper crops just grow, like Topsy, with no special effort. The story is told of how one successful back-yard gardener was one day playing host to a group of such admiring visitors who were torn between admiration and the dark stirrings of envy as they gazed at his flower beds, all blazing with color and perfume. "Of course it is easy for you to have such a beautiful garden with your good soil," said one of the covetous flower lovers. "Just see what fine loamy stuff it is!" and she stooped down and stirred the surface with a light touch of her finger tips. "Yes," agreed their host affably, yet with a twinkle in his eye, "you are right. It is wonderful soil?who should know better than I just how good it is, for I mixed it, every spadeful, with my own hands, and brought it all here in my wheelbarrow." Weare not all endowed with such courage, nor blessed with such forthright gardening zeal as this successful gardener, but it is to be hoped that his good example of industry gave his visitors a new outlook on this old problem. Actually, there is no soil so poor nor hopeless but it can, with a little intelligent effort, be made into a good garden loam. Anyone who is willing to take the trouble can soon become the proud and happy possessor of a rich, loamy garden soil. The thing is, to first analyze your natural soil in an endeavor to discover what is lacking, and then set about a planned program of supplying what is lacking. This may take Page 177 178 several years, for we cannot all follow the method of the successful gardener who mixed his soil in a wheelbarrow, but even one season's efforts can materially improve any soil's growing conditions. THERE are two main types of soil; namely, the clay soil and that which is of a sandy nature. Many of us are only too familiar with the first. If yours is sticky and hard to work when wet, yet when dry is even more difficult and impenetrable? then you can write yours down as the clay soil?and this has damaged a good many otherwise naturally cheerful and hopeful dispositions. Yet, once this type has been lightened with the proper soil ingredients it can become an almost perfect garden soil. The gardener who owns the clay soil should make every effort to add sand, just plain builders' or clean river sand, to help loosen it up, and ashes from both the coal furnace or stove and from the wood-burning fireplace, these supplying valuable potash as well as improving the soil's texture. The ashes should first be sifted to remove clinkers, and then added and well worked in before any planting is done. The clay soil must be watched as it dries out so that it can be worked at just the proper time. If worked when too wet, it is a gummy, sticky mess, and if left until it forms that forbidding hard crust, then it is equally difficult to work. There is a happy time just between the two?when it is partially dry?that any clay soil becomes quite obliging and workable. This is the time to attack it, for elbow grease looms large in the program if the clay soil is to be made over and improved. It must be dug and dug and worked over and over. And any soil improver which is added must be mixed thoroughly. The sandy soil, unless doctored up, is just as unsatisfactory as the clay soil. It is lean and hungry and dries out quickly. The unfortunate gardener must constantly apply moisture, and even so, the plants will not thrive on such poor stuff. But by adding humus, generous and abundant humus, the soil will become a lovely rich loam. One can scarcely overdo the application of humus if the natural soil is a sandy one. | ae what, do I hear you murmur, is this mysterious humus that we hear so much about? The answer is, humus is any organic material which has decayed and become rich black loam. This is the stuff which can add that spark to awaken your poor stubborn clay soil into a teeming productiveness; and it also supplies the rich nourishment which makes the thin, hot, and meager sandy soil into a loam brimming with life and vitality. The most common means of securing this valuable humus has been by means of barnyard manure, but in using this directly in the soil in preparation for immediate planting, the manure must be well rotted and decomposed so that it will not cause injury to the roots of plants. Manure which is new can be added as a mulch on top of the ground after planting is done with safety, or it can be used to enrich the ground by applying a generous layer on top in late fall, there to lie and weather and disintegrate during the winter. But when being mixed directly with the soil, it should be old and mellow. SOIL IMPROVEMENT IN THE HOME GARDEN But there is still another valuable source where any home gardener can secure a marvelous supply of this invaluable soil improver. Every garden, no matter how small, should have a spot in some out-of-the-way corner where a pit can be dug in which all the green refuse from the garden and the kitchen can be thrown, there to lie and rot and disintegrate and become rich, black leaf mold, the most potent of all aids to healthy and abundant growth of garden plants. Why do gardeners neglect to make use of this simple and easy means by which their garden soils can be built up and made into that crumbly loam which is the prime requirement of a successful garden? It is sheer waste to burn such materials as lawn clippings, fallen leaves, weed tops, discarded plants of all types, clippings, faded flowers, vegetable tops of all kinds, outer leaves of lettuce, orange, lemon, and grapefruit rinds, and apple peelings. These materials that are usually burned or thrown into the garbage cans are invaluable as a quick disintegrating source of rich humus. They decay in a few months' time, and leave that valuable spark which supplies the poor soil with the magical elements for stimulating new growth. The compost pit or hole should be deep enough (about three feet) so that the contents are kept moist below the surface of the ground, for it is the moisture which hastens disintegration. <A layer of ordinary soil can be added occasionally as the pit is filled to assist in the process of decay, and if the entire mass is turned over once or twice, this too will help. Some gardeners also add lime 179 occasionally to assist and hurry the process of making the green rubbish into rich black soil. When the pit has stood the required time, which varies from six to eighteen months, the contents should be put through a screen to sift out any parts that have not fully rotted, and these can be thrown back to form the beginning of another supply. The compost will be found more valuable than pearls and emeralds to any back-yard gardener. It can be used on any plant, and placed directly around the roots of all plants and bulbs, while the manure, which is our other valuable source of humus, cannot be placed close to the roots as it may damage them unless it is very old and well rotted. ONE very simple and easy method of quickly improving the soil in the perennial garden, or where shrubs or trees are to be planted, is to dig a hole large and deep enough to contain the roots of the plant when they will be fully grown. Cart this poor soil away for use in supplying the thin layer over your refuse in the compost pile, and substitute the lovely and rich black humus from the compost pit. Then set out your new plant. In this manner, one can gradually supply all the plants of the garden with this perfect soil to encourage the feeding roots to go deep into the ground, thus producing robust growth above ground, for it is the feeding roots below the surface that supply our plants with the elements which make them grow. Compost can also be used in the Victory gardens, mixing it with the regular soil of both the clay and sandy types, to furnish added fertility 180 and to improve the texture and help the soil to more quickly absorb and retain moisture. In small city gardens where space is valuable and neighbors are near by, a wooden cover can be constructed to place over the compost pit, which will prevent it from becoming  nuisance. Wherever practical, more than one pit should be used, so that while one is filled and ripening for use, another can be gradually filled, thus the gardener can soon acquire a permanent source of rich black loam to help keep all types of plants, both indoor and out, in a state of pounding and fertile growth.
