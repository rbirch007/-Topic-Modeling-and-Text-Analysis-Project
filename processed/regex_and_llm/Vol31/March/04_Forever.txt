forever gone by! So said the clergy of my own time, and the clergy professed to know. Although my parents adhered to the Baptist creed, they extended to their children the right, and Narcissa, Pocohontas, Minerva, 134 forded us every opportunity we desired, to examine all creeds?to hear and judge?to "prove all things." Through being conversant with priests and people of different sects, I found them widely differing from each other; and all, more widely differing from that "form of doctrine," and practice described in the New Testament, with the writings in which, I grew more and more familiar year by year. Feeling that religion was necessary, I sought for it; but, when I asked, like one of old, "What shall I do to be saved?" and was told that I must have a change of heart, and, to obtain it, I must feel myself to be the worst of sinners, and acknowledge the justice of God in consigning me to everlasting torment, the common sense with which God had endowed me, revolted, for I knew I had lived a virtuous and conscientious life, and no consideration could extort from me a_ confession so absurd. Some told me one thing and some another; but there was no Peter, "endowed from on high." I heard Alexander Campbell' advocate the literal meaning of the Scriptures?listened to him with deep interest?hoped his new life led to a fulness?was baptized, and soon learned that, as well they might, he and his followers disclaimed all authority, and my baptism was of no consequence, During my brief attachment to that church I was deeply interested in the study of the ancient Prophets, in which I was assisted by the erudite A. Campbell, Walter Scott* whose acquaintance I made, but more particularly [by] Sidney Rigdon who was a frequent visitor at my father's house. In the autumn of 1829 I heard of Joseph Smith as a Prophet to whom the Lord was speaking from the heavens; and that a Sacred Record containing a history of the origin of the aborigines of America, was unearthed. A Prophet of God?the voice of God revealing to man as in former dispensations, was what my soul had hungered for, but could it possibly be true?I considered it a hoax?too good to be true. In the winter of 1830 and '31, Joseph Smith called at my father's, and as he sat warming himself, I scrutinized his face as closely as I could without attracting his attention, and decided that his was an honest face. My adopted motto, "prove all things and hold fast that which is good," prompted me to investigate, as incredulous as I was; and the most impressive testimonies I had ever heard were given by two of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon, at the first meeting of the believers in Joseph Smith's mission, which I attended. (2) Alexander Campbell (1788-1866) was cofounder with his father, Thomas Campbell, of the church or sect, Disciples of Christ. From 1813 until 1830 they remained nominally Baptists, but there were differences which caused trouble. When Alexander assumed leadership, he advocated a return to scriptural simplicity in organization and doctrine, and his followers in the denomination became known as Reformers. The sect is often referred to as Campbellite.

Vol. I, footnote p, 121. SKETCH OF MY LIFE What avail the parade and the splendor here, To a legal heir to a heavenly sphere? To the heir of salvation, what is the worth, In their perishing state, the frail things of earth? What a death to the past, to the good, but on entrance gate, That is placed on the verge of a rich estate. Where commissioned escorts awaiting by? Bury me quietly where I die. 
Like a beacon that rises o?er ocean?s wave, There?s a light-there?s a life beyond the grave; The future is bright, and it beckons one on Where the noble and pure and the brave have gone, Who have battled for truth with their mind and might, With their garments clean and their armor bright: They are dwelling with God, in a world on high: Bury me quietly when I die. Salt Lake City, Utah, April 13, 1885 Eliza Roxy Snow Smith REPRODUCTION OF LAST FOLIO PAGE OF "SKETCH OF ING THE AUTHOR'S SIGNATURE AND THE DATE WHE MY LIFE" SHOW. N COMPLETED. 135? 136 On the 5th of April, 1835, I was baptized by a "Mormon" Elder", and in the evening of that day, I realized the baptism of the Spirit as sensibly as I did that of the water in the stream. I had retired to bed, and as I was reflecting on the wonderful events transpiring around me, I felt an indescribable, tangible sensation, if I may so call it, commencing at my head and enveloping my person and passing off at my feet, producing inexpressible happiness. Immediately following, I saw a beautiful candle with an unusual long, bright blaze directly over my feet. I sought to know the interpretation, and received the following, "The lamp of intelligence shall be lighted over your path." I was satisfied. In December I went to Kirtland ?was happy in an association with the Saints, fully appreciating their enlarged views and rich intelligence from the fountain of Eternal Truth, through the inspiration of the Most High; and was present on the ever memorable occasion of the Dedication of the Kirtland Temple, (the building of which was commenced in June 1833, and completed in 1836) the first superstructure erected by command of God, and under His immediate direction, for many centuries. In that Temple, after its dedication, I witnessed many manifestations of the power of God. In the spring of 1836, I taught a select school for young ladies, and boarded with the Prophet's family. At the close of the term I returned to my parental home, where friends and acquaintances flocked around me to enquire about the "strange people" with whom I was associated. I was exceedingly happy in testifying of what I had both seen and heard, until the 1st of Jan. 1837, when I bade a final adieu to the home of my youth, to share the fortunes of the people of God. By solicitation, on my return I resided in the family of Joseph Smith, and taught his family school, and had ample opportunity to mark his "daily walk and conversation," as a prophet of God; and the more I became acquainted with him, the more I appreciated him as such. His lips ever flowed with instruction and kindness; and, although very forgiving, indulgent, and affectionate in his temperament, when his God-like intuition suggested that the welfare of his brethren, or the interests of the kingdom of God demanded it, no fear of censure?no love of approbation could prevent his severe and cutting rebuke. Though his expansive mind grasped the great plan of salvation and solved the mystic problem of man's destiny?though he had in his possession keys that unlocked the past and the future with its succession of eternities, in his devotions he was humble as a little child. Previous to the completion of the Temple, I proffered a cash donation to the "Building Committee," which they very much needed, but insisted on my acceptance of a note of hand for the amount. This, they subsequently redeemed by deeding me a valuable city lot, very favorably situated and under good cultivation (Continued on page 192) (4) "The Prophet Joseph Smith baptized my mother and two sisters, Leonora and Eliza R.
