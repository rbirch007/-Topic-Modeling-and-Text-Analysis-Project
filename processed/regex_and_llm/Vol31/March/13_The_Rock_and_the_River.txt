The Rock and the River Ezra J. Poulsen PART ONE THE rock, like a grim granite face, jutted out from the side of the ridge directly above the river, which meandered gracefully, and, at times, half hesitatingly through the valley. Over to the west, along the lazy slope dipping in below the cedar-covered foothills next to the gap, lay the Mansfield far, resplendent in its hundred acres of waving wheat, alfalfa, and corn; and comfortably secure in its weather-beaten frame house, surrounded by the orchard, the barns, and the cluster of brownish-green hay stacks. Then, too, there was the big corral in which John Mansfield milked his pure blooded Holstein | cows mornings and evenings, assisted by his son, Jack, and upon special occasions by Julia, his wife, and his laughing, blue-eyed daughter, Bonnie; for the Mansfields were thrifty, each one capable of pitching in and helping wherever needed. This is not to say there was no division of labor. Julia had been a model housekeeper from the beginning, and Bonnie was like her mother. John had expressed his contempt many a time for men who expect their women folks to work horses, a sentiment which had materialized early into electric lights for the Mansfield farm, and then in rapid succession, one labor-saving, gadget after another, until the conveniences in the home were the envy of the neighborhood. Yet John was inclined to be hard with himself and with others. Julia, whose nature ran toward soft and pliable qualities, often called him the Rock, at the same time pointing a warning finger at the hillside. To this, he had a ready answer. Half-derisively, half-playfully to her as the River. To follow the course of least resistance," he declared, when dealing with the all-important problem of disciplining the children. "Yes, but rocks, though hard, often break. 'Then there's no putting them together," she retorted. Bonnie learned early in life to address most of their petitions to their father through their mother. Firm as a rock," had, signifying her graduation from business school had been signed. "That's the reason we've had more opportunities than most of the other kids in the neighborhood." Even as Bonnie spoke, there was an air of vibrant mystery in her voice, as well as her eyes; for she looked eagerly through the big dining-room window down the driveway, rushed to her room and began combing Page 171 172 out her curly blonde hair. A moment later she reappeared in a natty red jacket and blue serge skirt. At about the same moment, the hum of a motor signified the approach of a car. Then came three sharp toots from a horn. Whistling under his breath, Jack sprang up to look out the window. Bonnie rushed to the door. "Mom, some of the kids are going downtown. Will it be all right if I go? I'll be back soon. Leave the dishes for me." Before Mrs. Mansfield could answer, Jack whistled again. This time it was a very slow, mellow, tantalizing whistle, which quickly brought the pink to Bonnie's cheeks, for she saw her brother was looking straight at her. "What a sophisticated, grown-up sis I've got!" he cried, observing her tallish gracefulness, emphasized by high-heeled shoes. Teasingly, his thumb tilted back over his shoulder. "And the handsome soldier out in the car, is, is?he just one of the kids?" Bonnie was confused. "Er?yes, no. Well, that's Dale Weyman. He's visiting up at Davidsons." She threw a startled glance at both her father and her mother, then dashed through the door and down the path. The sound of merry voices floated up through the locust trees, splashing their shadows in the dusty gold of the June sunset, as the car drove away. 6? TALE Weyman, who is he, anyway?" asked Julia Mansfield of her daughter as the latter was keeping her promise about washing the dishes before going to bed. "Oh, I don't know," replied Bonnie  evasively. "He's one of Dick Davidson's friends from the army. He lives in the East; and since he had a short furlough the same time as Dick, Dick brought him home. Oh, but mother, he's a grand person, well educated, and refined, and, and handsome." Instinctively, Bonnie stopped, feeling that she had blundered.. "Be very careful. You know how we feel about your going with strangers," advised her mother. "But Mother!"?Bonnie squelcheda hasty retort. However, the next day she triumphantly felt she had a better answer; for Dale Weyman himself came to the Mansfield farm and she introduced him to the family. This was a day of unusual significance in the Mansfield home. Neither Jack nor Bonnie nor their parents, at the moment, realized the extent of this truth. Nevertheless, this was the first time one of the children had brought home a person of the opposite sex, except the neighbors' children, whose presence had always been accepted in the casual, easy-going way, characteristic of rural democracy. But now, John and Julia Mansfield suddenly began to realize that their children were grown, and in the usual course of events might be expected to choose their own life's companions. Bonnie's obvious interest in Dale Weyman made this starkly clear. Still, in the immediate responsibility of entertaining a guest, a stranger, they forgot their mental reservations in their effort to show their hospitality. Even Jack, much to Bonnie's relief, was in his most interesting mood. "I'm a cadet at a flying school in the southwest," explained young THE ROCK AND THE RIVER Weyman. "If I'm lucky, and have enough happy landings, I'll get my wings before long." "I'm expecting my call any day now," declared Jack apologetically. "Tl very likely be in right after haying, and I hope I can do as well as you." "This terrible war!" sighed Mrs. Mansfield. "Isn't your mother heartsick?" "My?my mother is not living," he replied soberly. "I?I'm so sorry." Julia felt rebuked. She also felt very inadequate. Presently something vague and terrifying seemed to take possession of her mind. "Mr. Weyman lives in New York State," said Bonnie, anxious to promote greater ease. "He's studying to be a lawyer." John Mansfield's gray eyes shifted rather coolly, and his firm mouth grew a trifle firmer. He didn't care very much for the legal profession. "That's fine. You have a bright future," declared Julia, instinctively knowing her husband did not approve. "Why don't we all get in the car and go for a ride. Dad, mother, and all of us," proposed Jack with both enthusiasm and diplomacy. "Yes, let's do." cried Bonnie. "Tl get dinner. You young folks go," urged Julia in a spirit of retreat. "I've a few chores," declared John. "Take Mr. Weyman up to the top of the ridge and show him the valley," he suggested, turning the car key over to Jack. "Okay, Dad." The car rolled down the driveway a few minutes later. John and Julia Mansfield looked at each other with vague, questioning eyes, both secretly 173 wishing they had gone, neither admitting it. Presently John turned and went out to the corral. When the young people returned, Julia had a delicious dinner prepared; and the Mansfields, as well as their guest, sat down in good spirits. The game of getting acquainted was continued with enthusiasm. And Dale Weyman proved to be a good inquisitor as well as a successful defense council, as questions and answers were bandied about. Before the-meal was over, they had not only discussed the Mansfields and the Weymans, but also politics, religion, education, and a dozen other subjects, But more particularly, Bonnie's youthful appraising 'eyes had searched the features of the tall, auburn-haired young man sitting at right angles from her, and had driven invisible tentacles of admiration into his entire being, until he seemed glorified before her. In quite a different way, John Mansfield studied not only his guest but his daughter, and the gray tint in his eyes seemed to harden, as he made a mental note of Bonnie's too obvious interest in the stranger. "It's all right to be friendly," he was ruminating in his mind, even while he was talking about other matters, "but no more. Bonnie will have to be made to understand this at once." T turned out that Dale Weyman's furlough lasted longer than the Mansfields had expected. It also developed very quickly that his interest in Bonnie was active, and was meeting with encouragement. The next day he called for her in Dick Davidson's car. Though her mother 174 protested mildly, she finally consented to Bonnie's going for a ride. Then, on each of several succeeding days, he called. At last, John Mansfield, who had been nursing his disapproval in silence, confronted his daughter, his face as grim and hard as the rock beyond the river. "Bonnie, this will have to stop," he demanded.,. "But Father, he's a very nice young man," protested Bonnie. "And?I like him." "I never said anything about that. It's just that there must be nothing serious between you and him. Under no consideration are you to go out with him again in an automobile." Bonnie turned away silently. In her heart were certain wild, impulsive rumblings of rebellion. The next day down at the post office, she ran into Dale unexpectedly; and almost before she realized it, he led her to his car, and was driving gaily away with her. As she sank back in the cushions, she suddenly realized she was disobeying her father. "What a lucky break," he laughed. "We can take a long ride." "Oh, no," she protested. "I?I musn't.". "First we can go down to the village, and enjoy an ice-cream soda." "But my folks don't know where I am." He had no intention of being rude, and he was not aware of the validity of her objections. But his enthusiasm carried him on. "Then, we'll drive around the valley, and back along the river road." Bonnie let her eyes rest on his clear, angular face. His rather prominent nose, and finely chiseled mouth, at the moment wrinkled into a tantalizing smile, combined with his strong chin to give him a masculine appeal which subdued her. And under the visor of his military cap, his eyes, which she had previously observed were brownish, seemed like dark pools of inky blue. The car tilted on a stretch of hogback road, throwing her relaxed body against him. He slipped his arm around her shoulders, drawing her closer. "Bonnie, you're wonderful," he cried with sudden fervor. "I dread to think of leaving you." She didn't dare say what she felt. She merely looked across the fields, letting the June breeze fan her cheeks. 'There was an exhilarating moment of excitement. Then, swiftly she felt his arm tighten, and with passionate determination, he crushed her lips to his. She struggled, then yielded, vaguely aware of being subdued by forces beyond her control. "Darling, I love you," he whispered, quickly restoring his hold on the wheel. "Oh, Dale," she murmured. "I? I" He would have kissed her again, but the protest in her eyes stopped him, and they rode on in silence. There seemed to be an infinite number of things waiting to be said, yet words became difficult. "I leave tomorrow," he remarked solemnly. "You do? That sounds so final." "It's not final unless you make it so." Bonnie Mansfield was really a very tational person, consequently she began to take stock of the entire situation. "Do you think a ten-day acquaintance could be love?" she demanded with forced calmness. THE ROCK AND THE RIVER "I do!" He was emphatic she "I don't," she countered. She expected him to grow eloquent in an effort to prove his point, put he seemed to retreat within himself. She noticed the change and feared she had offended him. Have I made you angry?? she asked quite humbly. They reached the main highway, a mile above the village, and broke into the scattered stream of traffic. 'Tou have not," he replied with a wry grin, as he glanced appreciatively at her wavy yellow hair, and oval, girlish face. 'Tou have made me think? and quite determined to prove the honesty of my affection." In a few moments they reached the drugstore, and he took her in to get the promised ice-cream soda. In the presence of other people, they turned to lighter, gayer talk. D was in an especially good mood when - out her in the cat and drove in the direction of the river. "Do we take the rivet road valley toward your place?" he asked. "I?d love it," she declared. Home?" "That will be perfect. If?it? we're not too long," she murmured. I drew her closet 115 a group of magpies in an entangled wilderness of willows. "j made 4 great discovery i" town," he announced unexpectedly. "What?" "There's a fine opening, here for a It looks like a real ana I've finished the last few months of my Jaw course." "Oh, Dale, what an idea? she cried, hardly realizing the extent to which her voice betrayed her unconditional approval of the idea. ?Darling!? He pleaded. ?Will you marry me-then?? Her eyes indicated an affirmative answer, though her tongue refused to confirm it. But when he again crushed her in his arms, she did not make even a slight resistance. Suddenly, a truck thundered around the bend; a horn blared violently its s harp disapproving notes. They sprang apart. Bonnie gave a startled little cry, then turned slightly pale. "That was faster," she said a moment later she added, as if something long forgotten had just come back to her mind. "He has forbidden me to go out with you." Dale Weyman's face was serious, and very determined. "Then, we'll follow him up and I'll explain everything," he declared. "No, Dale, I'll do the explaining. Remember, you just picked me up by chance. We'll go up to the bluff as we said. Then, you'll let me off at the forks of the road. I'll go home just as I came? alone." He protested, but she would have it that way. "Goodby, Darling," he murmured with deep feeling. "And don't forget, I'm 176 "Goodby." She hurried away to keep control of her feelings. "And? and I'll be waiting." The rest of the family was at supper when she walked quietly but firmly into the house. "Bonnie!" John Mansfield's eyes were burning with anger. "What does this mean? I saw you down at the picnic grounds with young Weyman, didn't I?" "We were there, Father, and we thought we saw your truck go by." She went to her room to straighten her hair and try to compose herself for the ordeal of explaining truthfully what had happened between her and Dale, but her father's stern voice still rang in her ears, though she could hear her mother and even Jack speaking in her defense. Still, when she went to the table, his fury seemed only to have gathered strength. And it broke upon her like an avalanche. It is needless to repeat anything that John Mansfield said to his daughter; yet, though much of it was violent and unjust, it was, nevertheless, prompted by a true fatherly interest in his daughter's welfare. Neither had acted with any deliberate intention of doing wrong, yet the result was that one violent outburst produced another, for life is that way; and Bonnie, sobbing as if her heart would break, locked herself in her own room, and flung herself across her bed, where she gave way completely to emotional storm. The shadows crawled into her room?first, the long finger-like shadows of the Lombardy poplar trees, then, the deep, black ones which came in indistinct legions down from the hills. Finally, the moon arose above the ridge, throwing its serene rays across the rock below. Bonnie shuddered. There was no serenity in her heart. All was black and seething turmoil. She tried the window, then, cautiously raised it, after which she gathered a few clothes in a small suitcase, and slipped out into the garden. For a few moments, she concealed her white face in the shadow of an apple tree, while she glanced back at the house with an expression of combined anger and terror. Finally, she ran toward the road. (To be continued) The Pink Angel (Continued from page 155) "It's over there on the dressing table," said Nan, her eyes filling with quick tears. She kept them closed for a moment, and when she opened them again, Merrilyn, standing on a chair, had just finished tying the pink angel into place on the top of the tree. Then jumping down, she ran over to the bed and looking down at Nan with shining eyes, said, "It looks simply perfect, doesn't it?" "Simply perfect," Nan repeated, raising her face to meet Merrilyn's kiss.
