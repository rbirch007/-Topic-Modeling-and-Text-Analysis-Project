The Soldier and His Health Overseas Editor's Note: From a fact sheet received by the Relief Society in December 1943, furnished by the Publications Branch, Women's Interests Section, Bureau of Public Relations, Wart Department I. The health of the Army is better than it has ever been. Since Pearl Harbor, the Army's death rate from disease and injury has been the lowest in its history. Explanation: The records of the armed services reflect their thorough organization for health, the bases of which are: vaccines; rigorous sanitation; pre-induction screening (weeding out) of recruits supplemented by frequent postinduction health examinations, scientific research to provide troops with protections, proper nutrition, and suitable health devices for all. Environments, and ample hospitalization facilities. Example: "From the first landing (in Salerno Bay) to the date of this letter 3335 casualties have been admitted to Fifth Army U. S. Hospitals. The first hospital opened __, within 3 to 5 miles of the front lines. Another hospital began to function.. ? still closer and under most difficult conditions. Neither hospital had any nurses when opened. Thus far, there have been only 42 deaths in these hospitals. 32 of these cases died from wounds; 5 from disease and injury; 5 were enemy. From letter of Lt. Gen. Mark W. Clark to Maj. Gen. Norman T. Kirk, The Surgeon General, US. Army. Note: An average of a little more than 3 per cent of the Army personnel in this country was off duty because of sickness OF non-battle injuries at any given time during 19425 'abroad, the rate was slightly lower, even including battle casualties. Il. The Medical Department of the Army is hard at work at present on one of its chief problems: the treatment and prevention of malaria in hot climates overseas. The malaria rate has risen because of the increased war activity n malarious areas. Ill. Facts you should know about malaria: a. Malaria is preventable through prophet control measures. Pb. Malaria does not last throughout life. C. Malaria ls curable. D. Malaria does not usually incapacitate its victims any considerable length of time. E. Approximately so per cent of those contracting malaria have only a single attack. ?. Sometimes there are relapses in malaria, but the death rate is low, due to prompt medical attention. Page 188 THE SOLDIER AND HIS HEALTH OVERSEAS 189 IV. It is stated that, in foreign areas, our position in respect to malaria is better than that of other armies operating in the same theaters. Considering the severity of infectious conditions, our record is good. Comparison: Reports are that the Japanese failed to make adequate preparations against the fever and, as a consequence, their troops are suffering much more acutely than our own. V. The Army stresses that malaria is preventable through educating individual troops and officers to use constantly antimalarial measures and to take full advantage of the accomplishments of science and sanitation in combating the mosquitoes which transmit the germs. What Methods Are Used to Combat Malarial Mosquitoes? A. The individual soldier must be so conditioned that he will use his anti-mosquito weapons as automatically and efficiently as he uses other weapons. Comment: Brig. Gen. Charles C. Hillman, U. S. Army, who has recently reported on medical highlights in the Southwest Pacific, cautions, "It should be kept foremost in mind that the key to the control of the disease in forward areas lies in those two words, malaria discipline." b. The Army supplies the soldiers with booklets, lectures, movies, training literature, for guarding against malaria, since self-protection plays such an important part in controlling the disease. For instance: One booklet is called "This Is Ann," and begins '"'Ann really gets around. Her full name is Anopheles Mosquito and her trade is dishing out Malaria. She's at home in Africa, the Caribbean, India, the South and Southwest Pacific, and other Hot Spots. She's the only one in the world who can give you Malaria, so if you can beat her, you're safe.'' It goes on to tell the soldier just how Ann works spreading malaria; it describes the symptoms of malaria; gives a list of do's and don'ts. C. In addition to carrying out special malaria-prevention measures, the Army issues mosquito repellents, sprays, insect nets, protective clothing, etc. Examples: There has been made available to troops a mosquito repellent which, even under strenuous combat conditions, is effective for 4 hours. A "fool-proof'" mosquito bar under which the soldier sleeps has been developed for camps. VI. How does a soldier get malaria? All that is necessary to contract the disease is for the right kind of mosquito?the female of the genus Anopheles?to bite a human being who has the malaria germ in his bloodstream, and a week or two later to bite another human being. Note: The malaria mosquito bites at night, or in very shady places. There is a bewildering variety of Anopheles mosquitoes with different breeding habits and flying ranges. Controlling them depends on which branch of the family you are dealing with.  Sample: The complexity of this identification can be seen from the statement of Army epidemiologists that the variety of Anopheles mosquitoes in the Solomons differs from that in India; and that in turn from the type in Burma, while China has still another. Even Italy and Albania, although separated by only a narrow body of water, have different varieties of mosquito. VII. The treatment of malaria often has to be done repeatedly because the symptoms may recur. Explanation: Among the drugs used in malaria are quinine and atabrine, either of which when given by a medical officer for a week will often cure malaria. But sometimes even though a man feels well after treatment, the drugs have not destroyed all the germs. Some may hide away in the internal organs. Then, after ten days or a month, or sometimes longer, the disease appears again. There may be three or even more such attacks (called relapses) which have to be treated each time like a new infection. VIII. Dysenteries (including diarrheas) constitute another serious disease problem. They cause a large number of hospital admissions in the Army on overseas duty. Treatment: The sulfonamides do yeoman service in dysenteries?this time it is sulfaguanidine?effecting cures of even the more severe bacillary dysenteries in 5 to 7 days. Prevention: Prevention of gastro-intestinal infections is almost exclusively concerned with sanitary supervision, water supply, food supply, disposal of sewage, fly control, etc. IX. There have been no epidemics despite the fact that our soldiers are living and fighting in areas where plague, yellow fever, smallpox, typhus, cholera, typhoid, amoebic dysentery, and a score of other dangerous diseases are prevalent among the civilian population. Explanation: Soldiers going overseas are immunized against many of the diseases endemic in the areas they travel to or through. They are vaccinated against yellow fever, cholera, and typhus if stationed in areas where these diseases exist. They are occasionally vaccinated against plague, if dangerously exposed. More Facts: The record has been: no cases of yellow fever or plague; extremely few (less than 20) cases of smallpox, tetanus, or typhus; very infrequent cases of typhoid, during the war so far. Note: While there is reason to believe that vaccines will prevent these diseases in most exposed persons, the other control measures are never neglected. All possible sanitary steps are still taken. Comment: ''We've succeeded against wounds and diseases only because we've got powerful weapons with which to fight them. That we have... Drugs and, in most cases, enough of them, is due to the... Men and women in the drug industry here at home."?Col. Paul I. Robinson, Director of Army Procurement Medical Supplies. X. American troops already have seen action in areas where typhus infection is prevalent, and the record is excellent. Every member of our armed forces who goes into typhus zones receives three injections of typhus THE SOLDIER AND HIS HEALTH OVERSEAS 191 vaccine. This was the preparation for our troops who went into Egypt and North Africa. Note: The typhus vaccine used for our forces is stated to be the most effective in the world. Comparison: The Germans are known to have a typhus vaccine, but it has been proved that German soldiers, on the North African front at least, are not effectively immunized; nor are the Germans believed to have the vaccine in general use as yet. Figures: Burma-India theaters of operation show only 1 case of typhus. In the Middle East: While our forces were quartered in Egypt, there was a serious typhus epidemic among the civilian population, with an officially reported total of 32,000 cases in the first six months of 1943. There were 500 cases a week in Cairo alone during the peak of the epidemic. The death rate, as is usual with typhus, was about 50 "per cent. The U. S. Army reported less than a score of cases and almost no deaths from typhus in the entire Middle East command during the same period. XI. In this war all inductees receive chest X-rays in their preliminary examination. This is considered the best method of detecting incipient or early tuberculosis. It has eliminated nearly all cases of tuberculosis from the Anny. Comparison: Tuberculosis was a costly factor in the last war. It was first among all reasons for dismissal from the Army, causing almost 15 per cent of the disability discharges. XII. The prevalence of colds, pneumonia, and the common contagious diseases has been at about normal expected levels, but mortality due to these causes has been amazingly low. Prevention: Colds are prevented from spreading by segregation of the infected, adequate spacing of beds in barracks, and various other sanitary measures. Treatment: The sulfonamide drugs disarm many a killer, including pneumonia, which now has a fatality rate of only 4 per cent. Note: In the last war the influenza pandemic was responsible for in the neighborhood of 800,000 admissions to hospitals and for perhaps 25,000 deaths in addition to many deaths ascribed to pneumonia but brought on as a result of influenza infection. With other respiratory diseases it caused about one-third of the total admissions for disease in 1918 and roughly 80 per cent of disease deaths. XIII. The Army's astoundingly good record on venereal disease during this war did not just happen. It is partly due to the vigorous programs of public health authorities and agencies concerned with venereal disease control, partly due to the Army's uncompromising and realistic attack on the problem. Cures: Sulfonamides are used for gonorrhea and cures run approximately 70 per cent in a period of ten days. While the treatment for syphilis requires a longer period, new techniques to shorten the time for treatment are in the process of development. More Facts: The armed forces now accept inductees with uncomplicated cases of venereal diseases because of the high percentage of cures. Since this group of infected inductees is eliminated from the overall figure, it can be said that less than 3 per cent of the personnel become infected with venereal disease in the course of a year.  Note: The Army's rate of infection was even higher in the last war, running at over 9 per cent in 1918... Over go men a year out of 1000. XIV. Psychoneurotic breakdowns are a problem in the present war, as they are in all wars. Causes: Military specialists have assigned many contributing factors to the increase of psychoneurotic breakdowns, not the least of which is the crescendo of noise and tension in modern warfare. The major cause seems to be, according to these experts, unusually prolonged exposure to combat conditions. Figures: A significant proportion of all casualties in combat are psychoneurotic. Definition: A psychoneurosis is the physical expression of mental conflict, and ls not a sign of cowardice. The soldier is torn between his desire to stay at his post, and his natural instinct to stay alive. In the face of extreme exhaustion this conflict may produce an acute anxiety state, paralysis or anesthesia, reactive depressions, from which the soldier may recover promptly with proper rest and care. Oo Sketch of My Life (Continued from page 136) ?containing a house which accommodated two families: one part opportunely made a home for a widowed sister with two children? the other, I rented. This, like many other trivial events in human life, proved to be one of the little hinges on which events of immense weight occasionally turn. My brother Lorenzo' was in a Presbyterian College. From his letters I learned that he was investigating their orthodoxy. At length he wrote me, saying, "If you have nothing better to offer than this, then good bye to all religions." I feared he was approaching the vortex of infidelity, and felt that the only rescue was in the unadulterated Gospel of Jesus Christ, and was anxious to induce him to come where he could see its workings and judge for himself. I wrote him he could have a home with my sister, if he would spend his College vacation with us. He came, and to improve the time he engaged in study under an efficient Hebrew Teacher,' who had opened a school for the benefit of the Saints in Kirtland, and while studying a dead language, he also studied the eternal principles of a living faith. He was baptized ?ordained an Elder, and is now [1885] one of the Twelve Apostles. Although this belongs to my brother's history, I consider it one of the events of my life, inasmuch as he has been a great benefit to me, as well as having been energetically useful in the cause which I esteem dearer than my mortal life.
