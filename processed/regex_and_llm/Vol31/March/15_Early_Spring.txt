EARLY SPRING Alice Morrey Bailey Above the dreaming woman the ragged clouds drift by, Above the dreaming rivers, the tender, dreaming sky; But the vaporous ground is pungent in vale and mountain crest Of roots that seek their substance beneath Earth's swelling breast. A writhing, stretching movement within her fertile womb Belies the leafless branches, the stark, unwefted loom, The sun's administrations, the songbird's mad delight Awake the sleeping vision, dispel the winter night, Deliver her of burden, make the mother sing, Bring forth her sweetest treasure?give birth to elfin Spring.
