Lula Greene Richards to Observe Ninety-fifth Birthday Louisa Wells Luke E owe a debt of gratitude to W the founders and pioneers of all institutions connected with the development of our Church and state. It takes persistent effort and great ability to establish things. Mrs. Lula Greene Richards is one of these pioneers. A woman of talent and ability, she was Called to be the first editor of the Woman's Exponent, "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of all Nations," thus editing the periodical which gave Latter-day Saint women so many opportunities for expression and development. Sister Richards is a poet. She began her literary career as a very young girl by writing verses and poetry for the local papers and periodicals. With the aid of her father, and her friend Eliza R. Snow, she gained an education which fitted her for the role of editor, leader, writer, and pioneer. When you visit Sister Lula today you feel uplifted and inspired by her pure fine spirit. And you are impressed with her poetical ability and wonderful memory. When she was eight years old she read and learned an acrostic written by Phineas Young on the Book of Mormon. This inspired her to write an acrostic on her name, Louisa Lula Greene. She wrote it on a slate as she had not yet learned to use a pen. She must have been a small but vibrant child and a fine reader. Page 170 Today, she is still a fine reader and when she recites or reads a poem her face lights up and her voice rings with music and her whole being expresses rhythm, strength, and vigor. A visit with Sister Lula is a privilege and an inspiration. The following is the little poem she wrote when only eight years old: LOUISA LULA GREENE Little children when at play Oh! How quick will pass the day! United now all hand in hand, Is the playful little band, Skipping up and down the lane, As if they never thought of pain. Laughing, singing, making fun, Under, over, jump and run; Listening to each other's words? Answering like chattering birds. Glad to reach their home at last, 'Round the hearth they gather fast. Evening comes that they may rest, Early at night they are undressed. Now the little prayers are said, Each child then is put to bed. Sister Richards will celebrate her ninety-fifth birthday on April 8, 1944. We wish to offer our congratulations, and on behalf of all Latter-day Saint women, we wish to express our love and gratitude for her contribution to the founding of a fine institution, and for her inspiration to women at a time when the women of the world did not have the opportunity for development and expression that they have today.
