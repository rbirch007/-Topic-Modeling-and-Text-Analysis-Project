Lula Greene Richards to Observe Ninety-fifth Birthday Louisa Wells Luke E owe a debt of gratitude to W the founders and pioneers of all institutions connected with the development of our Church and state. It takes persistent effort and great ability to establish things. Mrs. Lula Greene Richards is one of these pioneers. A woman of talent and ability, she was Called to be the first editor of the Woman's Exponent, "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of all Nations," thus editing the periodical which gave Latter-day Saint women so many opportunities for expression and development. Sister Richards is a poet. She began her literary career as a very young girl by writing verses and poetry for the local papers and periodicals. With the aid of her father, and her friend Eliza R. Snow, she gained an education which fitted her for the role of editor, leader, writer, and pioneer. When you visit Sister Lula today you feel uplifted and inspired by her pure fine spirit. And you are impressed with her poetical ability and wonderful memory. When she was eight years old she read and learned an acrostic written by Phineas Young on the Book of Mormon. This inspired her to write an acrostic on her name, Louisa Lula Greene. She wrote it on a slate as she had not yet learned to use a pen. She must have been a small but vibrant child and a fine reader. Page 170 Today, she is still a fine reader and when she recites or reads a poem her face lights up and her voice rings with music and her whole being expresses rhythm, strength, and vigor. A visit with Sister Lula is a privilege and an inspiration. The following is the little poem she wrote when only eight years old: LOUISA LULA GREENE Little children when at play Oh! How quick will pass the day! United now all hand in hand, Is the playful little band, Skipping up and down the lane, As if they never thought of pain. Laughing, singing, making fun, Under, over, jump and run; Listening to each other's words? Answering like chattering birds. Glad to reach their home at last, 'Round the hearth they gather fast. Evening comes that they may rest, Early at night they are undressed. Now the little prayers are said, Each child then is put to bed. Sister Richards will celebrate her ninety-fifth birthday on April 8, 1944. We wish to offer our congratulations, and on behalf of all Latter-day Saint women, we wish to express our love and gratitude for her contribution to the founding of a fine institution, and for her inspiration to women at a time when the women of the world did not have the opportunity for development and expression that they have today. The Rock and the River Ezra J. Poulsen PART ONE THE rock, like a grim granite face, jutted out from the side of the ridge directly above the river, which meandered gracefully, and, at times, half hesitatingly through the valley. Over to the west, along the lazy slope dipping in below the cedar-covered foothills next to the gap, lay the Mansfield far, resplendent in its hundred acres of waving wheat, alfalfa, and corn; and comfortably secure in its weather-beaten frame house, surrounded by the orchard, the barns, and the cluster of brownish-green hay stacks. Then, too, there was the big corral in which John Mansfield milked his pure blooded Holstein | cows mornings and evenings, assisted by his son, Jack, and upon special occasions by Julia, his wife, and his laughing, blue-eyed daughter, Bonnie; for the Mansfields were thrifty, each one capable of pitching in and helping wherever needed. This is not to say there was no division of labor. Julia had been a model housekeeper from the beginning, and Bonnie was like her mother. John had expressed his contempt many a time for men who expect their women folks to work horses, a sentiment which had materialized early into electric lights for the Mansfield farm, and then in rapid succession, one labor-saving, gadget after another, until the conveniences in the home were the envy of the neighborhood. Yet John was inclined to be hard with himself and with others. Julia, whose nature ran toward soft and pliable qualities, often called him the Rock, at the same time pointing a warning finger at the hillside. To this, he had a ready answer. Half-derisively, half-playfully to her as the River. To follow the course of least resistance," he declared, when dealing with the all-important problem of disciplining the children. "Yes, but rocks, though hard, often break. 'Then there's no putting them together," she retorted. Bonnie learned early in life to address most of their petitions to their father through their mother. Firm as a rock," had, signifying her graduation from business school had been signed. "That's the reason we've had more opportunities than most of the other kids in the neighborhood." Even as Bonnie spoke, there was an air of vibrant mystery in her voice, as well as her eyes; for she looked eagerly through the big dining-room window down the driveway, rushed to her room and began combing Page 171 172 out her curly blonde hair. A moment later she reappeared in a natty red jacket and blue serge skirt. At about the same moment, the hum of a motor signified the approach of a car. Then came three sharp toots from a horn. Whistling under his breath, Jack sprang up to look out the window. Bonnie rushed to the door. "Mom, some of the kids are going downtown. Will it be all right if I go? I'll be back soon. Leave the dishes for me." Before Mrs. Mansfield could answer, Jack whistled again. This time it was a very slow, mellow, tantalizing whistle, which quickly brought the pink to Bonnie's cheeks, for she saw her brother was looking straight at her. "What a sophisticated, grown-up sis I've got!" he cried, observing her tallish gracefulness, emphasized by high-heeled shoes. Teasingly, his thumb tilted back over his shoulder. "And the handsome soldier out in the car, is, is?he just one of the kids?" Bonnie was confused. "Er?yes, no. Well, that's Dale Weyman. He's visiting up at Davidsons." She threw a startled glance at both her father and her mother, then dashed through the door and down the path. The sound of merry voices floated up through the locust trees, splashing their shadows in the dusty gold of the June sunset, as the car drove away. 6? TALE Weyman, who is he, anyway?" asked Julia Mansfield of her daughter as the latter was keeping her promise about washing the dishes before going to bed. "Oh, I don't know," replied Bonnie  evasively. "He's one of Dick Davidson's friends from the army. He lives in the East; and since he had a short furlough the same time as Dick, Dick brought him home. Oh, but mother, he's a grand person, well educated, and refined, and, and handsome." Instinctively, Bonnie stopped, feeling that she had blundered.. "Be very careful. You know how we feel about your going with strangers," advised her mother. "But Mother!"?Bonnie squelcheda hasty retort. However, the next day she triumphantly felt she had a better answer; for Dale Weyman himself came to the Mansfield farm and she introduced him to the family. This was a day of unusual significance in the Mansfield home. Neither Jack nor Bonnie nor their parents, at the moment, realized the extent of this truth. Nevertheless, this was the first time one of the children had brought home a person of the opposite sex, except the neighbors' children, whose presence had always been accepted in the casual, easy-going way, characteristic of rural democracy. But now, John and Julia Mansfield suddenly began to realize that their children were grown, and in the usual course of events might be expected to choose their own life's companions. Bonnie's obvious interest in Dale Weyman made this starkly clear. Still, in the immediate responsibility of entertaining a guest, a stranger, they forgot their mental reservations in their effort to show their hospitality. Even Jack, much to Bonnie's relief, was in his most interesting mood. "I'm a cadet at a flying school in the southwest," explained young THE ROCK AND THE RIVER Weyman. "If I'm lucky, and have enough happy landings, I'll get my wings before long." "I'm expecting my call any day now," declared Jack apologetically. "Tl very likely be in right after haying, and I hope I can do as well as you." "This terrible war!" sighed Mrs. Mansfield. "Isn't your mother heartsick?" "My?my mother is not living," he replied soberly. "I?I'm so sorry." Julia felt rebuked. She also felt very inadequate. Presently something vague and terrifying seemed to take possession of her mind. "Mr. Weyman lives in New York State," said Bonnie, anxious to promote greater ease. "He's studying to be a lawyer." John Mansfield's gray eyes shifted rather coolly, and his firm mouth grew a trifle firmer. He didn't care very much for the legal profession. "That's fine. You have a bright future," declared Julia, instinctively knowing her husband did not approve. "Why don't we all get in the car and go for a ride. Dad, mother, and all of us," proposed Jack with both enthusiasm and diplomacy. "Yes, let's do." cried Bonnie. "Tl get dinner. You young folks go," urged Julia in a spirit of retreat. "I've a few chores," declared John. "Take Mr. Weyman up to the top of the ridge and show him the valley," he suggested, turning the car key over to Jack. "Okay, Dad." The car rolled down the driveway a few minutes later. John and Julia Mansfield looked at each other with vague, questioning eyes, both secretly 173 wishing they had gone, neither admitting it. Presently John turned and went out to the corral. When the young people returned, Julia had a delicious dinner prepared; and the Mansfields, as well as their guest, sat down in good spirits. The game of getting acquainted was continued with enthusiasm. And Dale Weyman proved to be a good inquisitor as well as a successful defense council, as questions and answers were bandied about. Before the-meal was over, they had not only discussed the Mansfields and the Weymans, but also politics, religion, education, and a dozen other subjects, But more particularly, Bonnie's youthful appraising 'eyes had searched the features of the tall, auburn-haired young man sitting at right angles from her, and had driven invisible tentacles of admiration into his entire being, until he seemed glorified before her. In quite a different way, John Mansfield studied not only his guest but his daughter, and the gray tint in his eyes seemed to harden, as he made a mental note of Bonnie's too obvious interest in the stranger. "It's all right to be friendly," he was ruminating in his mind, even while he was talking about other matters, "but no more. Bonnie will have to be made to understand this at once." T turned out that Dale Weyman's furlough lasted longer than the Mansfields had expected. It also developed very quickly that his interest in Bonnie was active, and was meeting with encouragement. The next day he called for her in Dick Davidson's car. Though her mother 174 protested mildly, she finally consented to Bonnie's going for a ride. Then, on each of several succeeding days, he called. At last, John Mansfield, who had been nursing his disapproval in silence, confronted his daughter, his face as grim and hard as the rock beyond the river. "Bonnie, this will have to stop," he demanded.,. "But Father, he's a very nice young man," protested Bonnie. "And?I like him." "I never said anything about that. It's just that there must be nothing serious between you and him. Under no consideration are you to go out with him again in an automobile." Bonnie turned away silently. In her heart were certain wild, impulsive rumblings of rebellion. The next day down at the post office, she ran into Dale unexpectedly; and almost before she realized it, he led her to his car, and was driving gaily away with her. As she sank back in the cushions, she suddenly realized she was disobeying her father. "What a lucky break," he laughed. "We can take a long ride." "Oh, no," she protested. "I?I musn't.". "First we can go down to the village, and enjoy an ice-cream soda." "But my folks don't know where I am." He had no intention of being rude, and he was not aware of the validity of her objections. But his enthusiasm carried him on. "Then, we'll drive around the valley, and back along the river road." Bonnie let her eyes rest on his clear, angular face. His rather prominent nose, and finely chiseled mouth, at the moment wrinkled into a tantalizing smile, combined with his strong chin to give him a masculine appeal which subdued her. And under the visor of his military cap, his eyes, which she had previously observed were brownish, seemed like dark pools of inky blue. The car tilted on a stretch of hogback road, throwing her relaxed body against him. He slipped his arm around her shoulders, drawing her closer. "Bonnie, you're wonderful," he cried with sudden fervor. "I dread to think of leaving you." She didn't dare say what she felt. She merely looked across the fields, letting the June breeze fan her cheeks. 'There was an exhilarating moment of excitement. Then, swiftly she felt his arm tighten, and with passionate determination, he crushed her lips to his. She struggled, then yielded, vaguely aware of being subdued by forces beyond her control. "Darling, I love you," he whispered, quickly restoring his hold on the wheel. "Oh, Dale," she murmured. "I? I" He would have kissed her again, but the protest in her eyes stopped him, and they rode on in silence. There seemed to be an infinite number of things waiting to be said, yet words became difficult. "I leave tomorrow," he remarked solemnly. "You do? That sounds so final." "It's not final unless you make it so." Bonnie Mansfield was really a very tational person, consequently she began to take stock of the entire situation. "Do you think a ten-day acquaintance could be love?" she demanded with forced calmness. THE ROCK AND THE RIVER "I do!" He was emphatic she "I don't," she countered. She expected him to grow eloquent in an effort to prove his point, put he seemed to retreat within himself. She noticed the change and feared she had offended him. Have I made you angry?? she asked quite humbly. They reached the main highway, a mile above the village, and broke into the scattered stream of traffic. 'Tou have not," he replied with a wry grin, as he glanced appreciatively at her wavy yellow hair, and oval, girlish face. 'Tou have made me think? and quite determined to prove the honesty of my affection." In a few moments they reached the drugstore, and he took her in to get the promised ice-cream soda. In the presence of other people, they turned to lighter, gayer talk. D was in an especially good mood when - out her in the cat and drove in the direction of the river. "Do we take the rivet road valley toward your place?" he asked. "I?d love it," she declared. Home?" "That will be perfect. If?it? we're not too long," she murmured. I drew her closet 115 a group of magpies in an entangled wilderness of willows. "j made 4 great discovery i" town," he announced unexpectedly. "What?" "There's a fine opening, here for a It looks like a real ana I've finished the last few months of my Jaw course." "Oh, Dale, what an idea? she cried, hardly realizing the extent to which her voice betrayed her unconditional approval of the idea. ?Darling!? He pleaded. ?Will you marry me-then?? Her eyes indicated an affirmative answer, though her tongue refused to confirm it. But when he again crushed her in his arms, she did not make even a slight resistance. Suddenly, a truck thundered around the bend; a horn blared violently its s harp disapproving notes. They sprang apart. Bonnie gave a startled little cry, then turned slightly pale. "That was faster," she said a moment later she added, as if something long forgotten had just come back to her mind. "He has forbidden me to go out with you." Dale Weyman's face was serious, and very determined. "Then, we'll follow him up and I'll explain everything," he declared. "No, Dale, I'll do the explaining. Remember, you just picked me up by chance. We'll go up to the bluff as we said. Then, you'll let me off at the forks of the road. I'll go home just as I came? alone." He protested, but she would have it that way. "Goodby, Darling," he murmured with deep feeling. "And don't forget, I'm 176 "Goodby." She hurried away to keep control of her feelings. "And? and I'll be waiting." The rest of the family was at supper when she walked quietly but firmly into the house. "Bonnie!" John Mansfield's eyes were burning with anger. "What does this mean? I saw you down at the picnic grounds with young Weyman, didn't I?" "We were there, Father, and we thought we saw your truck go by." She went to her room to straighten her hair and try to compose herself for the ordeal of explaining truthfully what had happened between her and Dale, but her father's stern voice still rang in her ears, though she could hear her mother and even Jack speaking in her defense. Still, when she went to the table, his fury seemed only to have gathered strength. And it broke upon her like an avalanche. It is needless to repeat anything that John Mansfield said to his daughter; yet, though much of it was violent and unjust, it was, nevertheless, prompted by a true fatherly interest in his daughter's welfare. Neither had acted with any deliberate intention of doing wrong, yet the result was that one violent outburst produced another, for life is that way; and Bonnie, sobbing as if her heart would break, locked herself in her own room, and flung herself across her bed, where she gave way completely to emotional storm. The shadows crawled into her room?first, the long finger-like shadows of the Lombardy poplar trees, then, the deep, black ones which came in indistinct legions down from the hills. Finally, the moon arose above the ridge, throwing its serene rays across the rock below. Bonnie shuddered. There was no serenity in her heart. All was black and seething turmoil. She tried the window, then, cautiously raised it, after which she gathered a few clothes in a small suitcase, and slipped out into the garden. For a few moments, she concealed her white face in the shadow of an apple tree, while she glanced back at the house with an expression of combined anger and terror. Finally, she ran toward the road. (To be continued) The Pink Angel (Continued from page 155) "It's over there on the dressing table," said Nan, her eyes filling with quick tears. She kept them closed for a moment, and when she opened them again, Merrilyn, standing on a chair, had just finished tying the pink angel into place on the top of the tree. Then jumping down, she ran over to the bed and looking down at Nan with shining eyes, said, "It looks simply perfect, doesn't it?" "Simply perfect," Nan repeated, raising her face to meet Merrilyn's kiss. Soil Improvement in the Home Garden Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, Deseret News IN garden making, be it Victory or flower gardening, the condition of the soil is the most common complaint of the amateur. It is safe to say that more grumbling is done about poor soil than any other garden deficiency, with less done to remedy this number-one problem. The home gardener will spend goodsized sums for purchasing the newest rose bush, but not one cent for? yes, you have guessed it?soil improvement! Beginners actually expect to find that perfect, loamy soil all ready and waiting for their light touch to awaken and bring it into a magical full production, but alas, few ever find such a happy state of affairs. Yet, we go merrily on putting in large and extensive flower beds and Victory gardens, and neglect to first examine and consider the betterment of the soil in which we plant. Many pseudo-garden lovers allow poor soil to be the alibi which excuses their own shabby home grounds, contending that their neighbor's beautiful flower garden and bumper crops just grow, like Topsy, with no special effort. The story is told of how one successful back-yard gardener was one day playing host to a group of such admiring visitors who were torn between admiration and the dark stirrings of envy as they gazed at his flower beds, all blazing with color and perfume. "Of course it is easy for you to have such a beautiful garden with your good soil," said one of the covetous flower lovers. "Just see what fine loamy stuff it is!" and she stooped down and stirred the surface with a light touch of her finger tips. "Yes," agreed their host affably, yet with a twinkle in his eye, "you are right. It is wonderful soil?who should know better than I just how good it is, for I mixed it, every spadeful, with my own hands, and brought it all here in my wheelbarrow." Weare not all endowed with such courage, nor blessed with such forthright gardening zeal as this successful gardener, but it is to be hoped that his good example of industry gave his visitors a new outlook on this old problem. Actually, there is no soil so poor nor hopeless but it can, with a little intelligent effort, be made into a good garden loam. Anyone who is willing to take the trouble can soon become the proud and happy possessor of a rich, loamy garden soil. The thing is, to first analyze your natural soil in an endeavor to discover what is lacking, and then set about a planned program of supplying what is lacking. This may take Page 177 178 several years, for we cannot all follow the method of the successful gardener who mixed his soil in a wheelbarrow, but even one season's efforts can materially improve any soil's growing conditions. THERE are two main types of soil; namely, the clay soil and that which is of a sandy nature. Many of us are only too familiar with the first. If yours is sticky and hard to work when wet, yet when dry is even more difficult and impenetrable? then you can write yours down as the clay soil?and this has damaged a good many otherwise naturally cheerful and hopeful dispositions. Yet, once this type has been lightened with the proper soil ingredients it can become an almost perfect garden soil. The gardener who owns the clay soil should make every effort to add sand, just plain builders' or clean river sand, to help loosen it up, and ashes from both the coal furnace or stove and from the wood-burning fireplace, these supplying valuable potash as well as improving the soil's texture. The ashes should first be sifted to remove clinkers, and then added and well worked in before any planting is done. The clay soil must be watched as it dries out so that it can be worked at just the proper time. If worked when too wet, it is a gummy, sticky mess, and if left until it forms that forbidding hard crust, then it is equally difficult to work. There is a happy time just between the two?when it is partially dry?that any clay soil becomes quite obliging and workable. This is the time to attack it, for elbow grease looms large in the program if the clay soil is to be made over and improved. It must be dug and dug and worked over and over. And any soil improver which is added must be mixed thoroughly. The sandy soil, unless doctored up, is just as unsatisfactory as the clay soil. It is lean and hungry and dries out quickly. The unfortunate gardener must constantly apply moisture, and even so, the plants will not thrive on such poor stuff. But by adding humus, generous and abundant humus, the soil will become a lovely rich loam. One can scarcely overdo the application of humus if the natural soil is a sandy one. | ae what, do I hear you murmur, is this mysterious humus that we hear so much about? The answer is, humus is any organic material which has decayed and become rich black loam. This is the stuff which can add that spark to awaken your poor stubborn clay soil into a teeming productiveness; and it also supplies the rich nourishment which makes the thin, hot, and meager sandy soil into a loam brimming with life and vitality. The most common means of securing this valuable humus has been by means of barnyard manure, but in using this directly in the soil in preparation for immediate planting, the manure must be well rotted and decomposed so that it will not cause injury to the roots of plants. Manure which is new can be added as a mulch on top of the ground after planting is done with safety, or it can be used to enrich the ground by applying a generous layer on top in late fall, there to lie and weather and disintegrate during the winter. But when being mixed directly with the soil, it should be old and mellow. SOIL IMPROVEMENT IN THE HOME GARDEN But there is still another valuable source where any home gardener can secure a marvelous supply of this invaluable soil improver. Every garden, no matter how small, should have a spot in some out-of-the-way corner where a pit can be dug in which all the green refuse from the garden and the kitchen can be thrown, there to lie and rot and disintegrate and become rich, black leaf mold, the most potent of all aids to healthy and abundant growth of garden plants. Why do gardeners neglect to make use of this simple and easy means by which their garden soils can be built up and made into that crumbly loam which is the prime requirement of a successful garden? It is sheer waste to burn such materials as lawn clippings, fallen leaves, weed tops, discarded plants of all types, clippings, faded flowers, vegetable tops of all kinds, outer leaves of lettuce, orange, lemon, and grapefruit rinds, and apple peelings. These materials that are usually burned or thrown into the garbage cans are invaluable as a quick disintegrating source of rich humus. They decay in a few months' time, and leave that valuable spark which supplies the poor soil with the magical elements for stimulating new growth. The compost pit or hole should be deep enough (about three feet) so that the contents are kept moist below the surface of the ground, for it is the moisture which hastens disintegration. <A layer of ordinary soil can be added occasionally as the pit is filled to assist in the process of decay, and if the entire mass is turned over once or twice, this too will help. Some gardeners also add lime 179 occasionally to assist and hurry the process of making the green rubbish into rich black soil. When the pit has stood the required time, which varies from six to eighteen months, the contents should be put through a screen to sift out any parts that have not fully rotted, and these can be thrown back to form the beginning of another supply. The compost will be found more valuable than pearls and emeralds to any back-yard gardener. It can be used on any plant, and placed directly around the roots of all plants and bulbs, while the manure, which is our other valuable source of humus, cannot be placed close to the roots as it may damage them unless it is very old and well rotted. ONE very simple and easy method of quickly improving the soil in the perennial garden, or where shrubs or trees are to be planted, is to dig a hole large and deep enough to contain the roots of the plant when they will be fully grown. Cart this poor soil away for use in supplying the thin layer over your refuse in the compost pile, and substitute the lovely and rich black humus from the compost pit. Then set out your new plant. In this manner, one can gradually supply all the plants of the garden with this perfect soil to encourage the feeding roots to go deep into the ground, thus producing robust growth above ground, for it is the feeding roots below the surface that supply our plants with the elements which make them grow. Compost can also be used in the Victory gardens, mixing it with the regular soil of both the clay and sandy types, to furnish added fertility 180 and to improve the texture and help the soil to more quickly absorb and retain moisture. In small city gardens where space is valuable and neighbors are near by, a wooden cover can be constructed to place over the compost pit, which will prevent it from becoming  nuisance. Wherever practical, more than one pit should be used, so that while one is filled and ripening for use, another can be gradually filled, thus the gardener can soon acquire a permanent source of rich black loam to help keep all types of plants, both indoor and out, in a state of pounding and fertile growth.

A Brief History of the Spring City Relief Society. Related by Bergetta Jensen, President. [The Magazine prints this account of the activities of the Spring City, North Sanpete
Stake, Relief Society as being typical in many ways of other Relief Societies. ? Ed.] AN organization known as ?A Female Relief Society? was organized in Spring City, May ID, 1868, under the direction of Bishop C. G. Larsen and Counselors James Allred and Peter Rasmussen. Mary Ann Price Hyde was sustained as president with Elizabeth Allred as 1st counselor and Anna N. Larsen as 2nd counselor, Sarah Ellis as treasurer, and Elizabeth Fretwell as secretary. On May 13, 1868, another meeting was held and six teachers were appointed. The time for holding
meetings was set for the first Thursday in each month at 2 p.m. An entrance fee was given by each member which usually consisted of a few pounds of wool yarn, quilt blocks, scraps of cloth, or anything that might be converted into something usable. At first, the organization consisted of fifteen members, and on the 13th of May 1869, the enrollment had grown to 104 and the charitable receipts and expenditures for one year made a balance of $105.20. On November 10, 1870, the cornerstone for a Relief Society Hall was laid on the city lot owned by the Relief Society. A granary was later erected on the same lot and
the building of the Hall was abandoned on the advice of the Authorities who deemed it advisable to center our efforts in the erection of a new meetinghouse for the ward. In June 1870, the grasshopper pest threatened the valley and the
sisters made efforts to save the crops and glean all they could. Sister Lizzie
was sent to Manti by the Relief Society to learn to braid straw and make hats, and in turn teach the sisters that all might have hats. In the year of 1874, *^^ sisters were asked to plant mulberry trees and begin the raising of silk worms
which was undertaken but afterwards abandoned. On the Fourth of July, 1876,
marking the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence,
the Relief Society was invited to arrange for a fitting celebration. The brethren built a bowery and the sisters supplied an appropriate program with a feast, and dance for all in the evening. The Exponent was then known as the Relief Society organ, and through this paper. President Brigham Young advised the sisters to store wheat for a time of famine. In December 1876, came a call
for the Society to do its bit toward the building of a temple at Manti. Many hundreds of dollars were donated besides carpets, rugs, fancy work, etc., that were given to help beautify the building. In December 1878, the Relief Society
deeded one-half its lot to the School Board, on which to erect a school building.
Page 181 182 In the year 1879, many new Saints arrived and much was done toward making them comfortable for the winter. Much gleaning was done and wheat stored this year. September 20, 1881, President Eliza R. Snow and Emmeline B. Wells visited the ward Relief Society. In eight years, the Relief Society had donated $800.00 in cash to the Manti Temple besides helping to feed and care for those who labored in its erection, and was pleased to help furnish and decorate it with the articles before mentioned. The first 17th of March celebration was held in 1892. Each one in the ward was invited to attend, and a large gathering resulted, each person bringing a lunch basket, prepared to spend the day. An inspiring program consisting of songs, testimonies, dialogues, readings, reminiscences, etc., was given. At noon, luncheon was served, after which the program continued, and closed with a dance in the evening. For many years this was the day on which the annual fee of ten cents was paid by each Relief Society member as a means of assisting in the general expense of the organization. At a conference held this same year, the report showed 55,000 bushels of wheat stored by the Relief Societies of the stake. This year, the women made much homemade cloth, hosiery, and much apparel for the poor. Again the sisters gathered grain, and it is to be noted that under the direction of President Tulgreen the granary was spotlessly clean, free from mice or vermin, and in every way was typical of Relief Society ideals. The San Francisco disaster of 1906 called for help in the line of quilts, food, soap, clothing, and cash, which was readily responded to. World War I opened the way to explain Relief Society work to many people who had not known of it previously, but were willing to help. Much sewing, knitting, quilting, and other work was done. Beautiful lessons for each meeting had -been introduced into our Society, and a "Baby Day" was featured, at which time sixty-five babies were examined by doctors. Then came the dreaded flu epidemic and again was the call heeded for financial help and nursing assistance. In 1923, came the call for stored wheat. The Government needed it, and wheat to the amount of $3,416.79 was sold. The money was placed (according to counsel) in the Presiding Bishop's Office in Salt Lake City. The interest money from this wheat fund was used for maternity and _ child-welfare work. Clinics for school children continue to be held. During the years 1923 to 1928, a great amount of temple work was done by the Relief Society. In addition to caring for the sick, the poor, and other duties incident to regular Relief Society work, the sisters visited the homes, and encouraged all to try to do temple work. During one year alone, work was done for more than one thousand people for the Spring City Ward. Note: A picture of the Spring City Relief Society granary is found in A Centenary of Relief Society, p. 73. How I Help Ward Literature Leaders in Lieu of Union Meetings Fae J. Nielsen Member of Pocatello Stake Board THE discontinuance of union meetings has had a tendency toward promoting close harmony between our stake and ward literature leaders. We have learned to pool our good ideas as well as our problems, and thereby help each other. We have each become more self-reliant and more cooperative. Since the reading of the Bible has been urged in the auxiliary organizations of the Church, many people are discovering their interest in it. The modern translations of the Bible by Ernest S. Bates and Doctor Richard G. Moulton present this "priceless storehouse of excellent writing" arranged in forms conducive to leisure-time reading as well as study for spiritual guidance. I sincerely believe that a beautiful and lasting appreciation for Bible literature is being cultivated through the Relief Society. Most of us require a little persuasion to do the things which are best for us. The Government has carried out an extensive program to educate the public concerning the present need for good nutrition. Our literature classes are a medium through which the Relief Society is giving us spiritual and literary nourishment. Both programs have been planned to meet a very urgent present-day need for physical and spiritual fortitude. The ways in which I help ward literature leaders vary from month to month. However, there are some helps which may be used consistently by every stake class leader. Certainly, any system which results in thorough preparation is to be recommended. Classifications for Planning First, it is necessary to plan ahead; it is advisable to have lessons in mind two or three months in advance. Second, it is important to build an atmosphere which will lend added significance to the lesson to be presented. This may be done through coordination with the music department, use of short stories, selected poems, and visual aids, such as pictures and maps. Word pictures by people who have traveled or read a great deal, add a touch of reality. Third, know your sources of information; read your Bible. Use Thelessons, making repeated references to back lessons, 1. E., those for 1942-1943. They reveal new meanings with each reading. Repetition is one of the most dependable methods of teaching. To avoid monotony and strengthen its Page 183 184 appeal, an idea may often be expressed in different ways. Fourth, make your knowledge conversational; learn to talk about the Bible in an interesting manner with families and friends. Draw out well-informed persons of your acquaintance. Interesting experiences in reading the Bible will be related in class if Relief Society women feel at ease and in tune with the spirit of the lesson being presented. Fifth, learn to interpret the Bible in the language of our own times and apply it to present-day problems. Literature of any period is interpreted according to the student's knowledge and experience. First, Plan Your Lessons Ahead If earnest preparation is begun well in advance, most problems will take care of themselves. My most practical help in doing this is to keep a sheet of paper, or 4 notebook, handy, on which to make notations or references. Close by the telephone, where no one will disturb it, is the most convenient place for me to keep it. Any information receive from a ward leader over the telephone can be easily jotted down, or if a request comes for some special help, once it is written down it is not so apt to be overlooked. If an interesting thought comes over the radio while I'm about my work, it takes only a minute or two to write it on my handy sheet of paper. Then, when I'm ready to organize my material and commence the actual preparation of a lesson, I need not waste valuable time searching for something which I am sure 1 have some place. I also have a small notebook, 4 looseleaf, which I carry in my purse. In it, I take notes on meetings which I attend, copy interesting items which I read, or make a record of references for future study. When I begin to segregate my material according to its value for a particular lesson, I always have my notebook, the sheet of miscellaneous notations, and my Magazine at hand. These time-saver ideas simplify lesson planning and give me the feeling that an important part of the work is accomplished with comparatively little effort. I have also found that a dictionary and a Bible which is self-pronouncing are almost indispensable. By reading the lesson in the Magazine as soon as I receive it, 1 keep in mind the subjects of the lessons to come. Then in the margins of the Magazine, I make references to in formation which I find in my reading. I always have my Magazine with me. It requires so little space to carry and is a congenial companion with which to spend a few minutes. We used the lesson previews in the Magazine and study helps as a basis for discussion at the one planning meeting which we held in September. I tried to anticipate the problems which would need special consideration. Generally speaking, the ward leaders felt that this year's work would duplicate last year's lessons in some cases. Since then, however, we have come to know that the Bible is indeed a book of "hidden treasures." Against the background of last year's study, this season's lessons have been easier to present and more satisfying. Second, Build an Atmosphere It is important to build an atmosphere HOW | HELP WARD LITERATURE LEADERS which will furnish a background for and add significance to the lesson to be presented. This was demonstrated in the presentation of the lesson on the Creation. Wherever possible in the wards of our stake, parts of the oratorio, The Creation, by Haydn were reproduced on the piano, organ or phonograph. The music departments in the wards and stake cooperated wholeheartedly in making this possible. In some wards the story was successfully told to the musical accompaniment. In other wards the music was used as an introduction to the lesson or as a fitting climax. Well-chosen hymns which correlate with the lessons also add variety and interest, and can be sung as trios, duets, or solos with instrumental accompaniment. ' Short stories have been used to good advantage in centering the attention of a class of busy Relief Society women upon the subject at hand. Stories can be arranged to a convenient length for readings. Appropriate verses from the Relief Society Centennial Anthology of Verse are adaptable for this same purpose. Bits of poetry will often guide the trend of thought in a class to the subject of the lesson and incidentally illustrate the influence of the Bible upon the world's literature. Topics given by ward members on timely subjects related to the lesson have a wealth of possibilities as interest builders. Information can be found in current periodicals and library magazine files. I seldom look for some specific information but that I find something else of interest and value. All of these suggestions have been used in our wards. 185 Third, Know Your Sources of Information Know your sources of information; read your Bible. Both reading and talking about the Bible add comprehension to the study of it. Since I hesitate to rely upon my own understanding of the Bible, I take the precaution of naming the authority from which I quote. These quotations I feel free to pass along to the ward leaders by mail, by telephone, and through personal contacts. I have combined the best maps and pictures into a valuable scrapbook. Inasmuch as we have twelve wards in our stake and four wards sharing two chapels, I often visit two ward literature classes in one month. My scrapbook is very helpful in the preparation of the lessons. I started it last year and now it contains many pictures and maps cut from old copies of the National Geographic; souvenirs from Palestine sent to me by my brother who is with the army air corps in the Middle East; an interesting story of present-day Palestine from an old copy of the Improvement Era; news items; and typewritten copies of interesting information which I have gathered from my reading. This scrapbook is now one of my most interesting possessions. It has been my greatest source of ready information, always close at hand, the result of efforts both large and small. It has been used in many of the wards in its entirety and sections of it have been used in other wards. Copies of the typewritten information have been sent to all ward literature leaders. | also have a very good condensation of the story of Palestine taken from Carpenter's Travels. The librarian at our public library 186 has arranged a reserve shelf of books dealing with a study of Bible literature, for the convenience of ward class leaders. Current issues of the Improvement Era have interesting information, concerning ancient Israel; and The Children's Friend has recently published an interesting series called "Birds of the Bible." Fourth, Make Your Knowledge Conversational Learn to bring the Bible into daily conversations with your families and friends. Practically every day some faith-promoting incident is related over the radio, and a reference is made to this "Book of Books" which is acquiring added significance for many people. There is hardly a family who doesn't have some member in the service of the United Nations. How many testimonies are being strengthened by prayer, we cannot tell; but most people are willing to express their views concerning the Bible. By talking with the ones who have made a study of the Bible, through what we read, and in the light of what we, as Latter-day Saints know, we come to a clearer and broader understanding of its spiritual as well as its literary values. Upon several occasions I have consulted the director of the Latter-day Saint Institute in our town concerning questions which have come up in my preparation of lesson material. He has promptly referred me to information which I can study for myself. I have recommended that every ward literature leader take advantage of the Bible classes which he conducts one evening each week during the college term. It is a privilege which is appreciated by class leaders. When possible, it is a good plan to read current books dealing with Bible times. The Robe by Lloyd C. Douglas is a very fine example of what Christianity can do in the lives of people. The Nazarene and The Apostle by Sholem Asch give very fine descriptions of conditions at the time of Christ and the Apostle Paul. Joseph and His Brethren by Thomas Mann or any of the other three books by this author dealing with the life of Joseph increases the reader's understanding of social customs and family life at that time, even though all the context may not be in accordance with Latter-day Saint belief. Fifth, Learn to Apply to Present Day Learn to interpret the Bible in the Janguage of our own time and apply it to present-day problems. The literature in the Bible is written in the setting of Bible times. Unless we interpret it in the light of our own time, it may seem abstract. The Gleaner Girls of today do not spend their time as did Ruth, yet they are often actuated by the same high principles. The story of Hannah is being lived by countless mothers in their care of and anxiety for their sons who may be in distant places. The story of Abraham's calling is applicable to the calling of men to the apostleship of our Church. The class leader who reads with the view of increasing her knowledge of Bible literature is rewarded with a feeling of joy in the work, which adds vitality to her lesson presentations. No class leader could expect her class to show enthusiasm over a study of Bible literature if she herself lacks enthusiasm. A good literature HOW I HELP WARD LITERATURE LEADERS leader studies industriously to broaden her own knowledge of the Bible and thereby win the interest of her class members. I sincerely appreciate the splendid cooperation of our ward. Literature leaders. I'm certain that they are 187 using their influence to bring Relief Society women closer to the inner spirit and true meaning of the Bible. I know of no finer opportunity for service nor one which pays more rich dividends in adding richness and meaning to life. FOREVER Jeanette P. Parry I saw the moon slip down the stairway of the night, And from the vastness of the dark I heard the dreary fog horns blow. 'Stirred by the deep cool breezes of the dawn The sea's great tongue lapped on the sand? The traveler that visits shores of many climes And holds within its turquoise depths The crimson tragedies of war, And, on its crested waves, the gilt of sunlit peace, That knows the sorrowing of mothers' hearts And lovers' tender partings on the sands. The surge of years has never changed its rhythmic way? The constant lapping of the sea An echo of eternity. The Soldier and His Health Overseas Editor's Note: From a fact sheet received by the Relief Society in December 1943, furnished by the Publications Branch, Women's Interests Section, Bureau of Public Relations, Wart Department I. The health of the Army is better than it has ever been. Since Pearl Harbor, the Army's death rate from disease and injury has been the lowest in its history. Explanation: The records of the armed services reflect their thorough organization for health, the bases of which are: vaccines; rigorous sanitation; pre-induction screening (weeding out) of recruits supplemented by frequent postinduction health examinations, scientific research to provide troops with protections, proper nutrition, and suitable health devices for all. Environments, and ample hospitalization facilities. Example: "From the first landing (in Salerno Bay) to the date of this letter 3335 casualties have been admitted to Fifth Army U. S. Hospitals. The first hospital opened __, within 3 to 5 miles of the front lines. Another hospital began to function.. ? still closer and under most difficult conditions. Neither hospital had any nurses when opened. Thus far, there have been only 42 deaths in these hospitals. 32 of these cases died from wounds; 5 from disease and injury; 5 were enemy. From letter of Lt. Gen. Mark W. Clark to Maj. Gen. Norman T. Kirk, The Surgeon General, US. Army. Note: An average of a little more than 3 per cent of the Army personnel in this country was off duty because of sickness OF non-battle injuries at any given time during 19425 'abroad, the rate was slightly lower, even including battle casualties. Il. The Medical Department of the Army is hard at work at present on one of its chief problems: the treatment and prevention of malaria in hot climates overseas. The malaria rate has risen because of the increased war activity n malarious areas. Ill. Facts you should know about malaria: a. Malaria is preventable through prophet control measures. Pb. Malaria does not last throughout life. C. Malaria ls curable. D. Malaria does not usually incapacitate its victims any considerable length of time. E. Approximately so per cent of those contracting malaria have only a single attack. ?. Sometimes there are relapses in malaria, but the death rate is low, due to prompt medical attention. Page 188 THE SOLDIER AND HIS HEALTH OVERSEAS 189 IV. It is stated that, in foreign areas, our position in respect to malaria is better than that of other armies operating in the same theaters. Considering the severity of infectious conditions, our record is good. Comparison: Reports are that the Japanese failed to make adequate preparations against the fever and, as a consequence, their troops are suffering much more acutely than our own. V. The Army stresses that malaria is preventable through educating individual troops and officers to use constantly antimalarial measures and to take full advantage of the accomplishments of science and sanitation in combating the mosquitoes which transmit the germs. What Methods Are Used to Combat Malarial Mosquitoes? A. The individual soldier must be so conditioned that he will use his anti-mosquito weapons as automatically and efficiently as he uses other weapons. Comment: Brig. Gen. Charles C. Hillman, U. S. Army, who has recently reported on medical highlights in the Southwest Pacific, cautions, "It should be kept foremost in mind that the key to the control of the disease in forward areas lies in those two words, malaria discipline." b. The Army supplies the soldiers with booklets, lectures, movies, training literature, for guarding against malaria, since self-protection plays such an important part in controlling the disease. For instance: One booklet is called "This Is Ann," and begins '"'Ann really gets around. Her full name is Anopheles Mosquito and her trade is dishing out Malaria. She's at home in Africa, the Caribbean, India, the South and Southwest Pacific, and other Hot Spots. She's the only one in the world who can give you Malaria, so if you can beat her, you're safe.'' It goes on to tell the soldier just how Ann works spreading malaria; it describes the symptoms of malaria; gives a list of do's and don'ts. C. In addition to carrying out special malaria-prevention measures, the Army issues mosquito repellents, sprays, insect nets, protective clothing, etc. Examples: There has been made available to troops a mosquito repellent which, even under strenuous combat conditions, is effective for 4 hours. A "fool-proof'" mosquito bar under which the soldier sleeps has been developed for camps. VI. How does a soldier get malaria? All that is necessary to contract the disease is for the right kind of mosquito?the female of the genus Anopheles?to bite a human being who has the malaria germ in his bloodstream, and a week or two later to bite another human being. Note: The malaria mosquito bites at night, or in very shady places. There is a bewildering variety of Anopheles mosquitoes with different breeding habits and flying ranges. Controlling them depends on which branch of the family you are dealing with.  Sample: The complexity of this identification can be seen from the statement of Army epidemiologists that the variety of Anopheles mosquitoes in the Solomons differs from that in India; and that in turn from the type in Burma, while China has still another. Even Italy and Albania, although separated by only a narrow body of water, have different varieties of mosquito. VII. The treatment of malaria often has to be done repeatedly because the symptoms may recur. Explanation: Among the drugs used in malaria are quinine and atabrine, either of which when given by a medical officer for a week will often cure malaria. But sometimes even though a man feels well after treatment, the drugs have not destroyed all the germs. Some may hide away in the internal organs. Then, after ten days or a month, or sometimes longer, the disease appears again. There may be three or even more such attacks (called relapses) which have to be treated each time like a new infection. VIII. Dysenteries (including diarrheas) constitute another serious disease problem. They cause a large number of hospital admissions in the Army on overseas duty. Treatment: The sulfonamides do yeoman service in dysenteries?this time it is sulfaguanidine?effecting cures of even the more severe bacillary dysenteries in 5 to 7 days. Prevention: Prevention of gastro-intestinal infections is almost exclusively concerned with sanitary supervision, water supply, food supply, disposal of sewage, fly control, etc. IX. There have been no epidemics despite the fact that our soldiers are living and fighting in areas where plague, yellow fever, smallpox, typhus, cholera, typhoid, amoebic dysentery, and a score of other dangerous diseases are prevalent among the civilian population. Explanation: Soldiers going overseas are immunized against many of the diseases endemic in the areas they travel to or through. They are vaccinated against yellow fever, cholera, and typhus if stationed in areas where these diseases exist. They are occasionally vaccinated against plague, if dangerously exposed. More Facts: The record has been: no cases of yellow fever or plague; extremely few (less than 20) cases of smallpox, tetanus, or typhus; very infrequent cases of typhoid, during the war so far. Note: While there is reason to believe that vaccines will prevent these diseases in most exposed persons, the other control measures are never neglected. All possible sanitary steps are still taken. Comment: ''We've succeeded against wounds and diseases only because we've got powerful weapons with which to fight them. That we have... Drugs and, in most cases, enough of them, is due to the... Men and women in the drug industry here at home."?Col. Paul I. Robinson, Director of Army Procurement Medical Supplies. X. American troops already have seen action in areas where typhus infection is prevalent, and the record is excellent. Every member of our armed forces who goes into typhus zones receives three injections of typhus THE SOLDIER AND HIS HEALTH OVERSEAS 191 vaccine. This was the preparation for our troops who went into Egypt and North Africa. Note: The typhus vaccine used for our forces is stated to be the most effective in the world. Comparison: The Germans are known to have a typhus vaccine, but it has been proved that German soldiers, on the North African front at least, are not effectively immunized; nor are the Germans believed to have the vaccine in general use as yet. Figures: Burma-India theaters of operation show only 1 case of typhus. In the Middle East: While our forces were quartered in Egypt, there was a serious typhus epidemic among the civilian population, with an officially reported total of 32,000 cases in the first six months of 1943. There were 500 cases a week in Cairo alone during the peak of the epidemic. The death rate, as is usual with typhus, was about 50 "per cent. The U. S. Army reported less than a score of cases and almost no deaths from typhus in the entire Middle East command during the same period. XI. In this war all inductees receive chest X-rays in their preliminary examination. This is considered the best method of detecting incipient or early tuberculosis. It has eliminated nearly all cases of tuberculosis from the Anny. Comparison: Tuberculosis was a costly factor in the last war. It was first among all reasons for dismissal from the Army, causing almost 15 per cent of the disability discharges. XII. The prevalence of colds, pneumonia, and the common contagious diseases has been at about normal expected levels, but mortality due to these causes has been amazingly low. Prevention: Colds are prevented from spreading by segregation of the infected, adequate spacing of beds in barracks, and various other sanitary measures. Treatment: The sulfonamide drugs disarm many a killer, including pneumonia, which now has a fatality rate of only 4 per cent. Note: In the last war the influenza pandemic was responsible for in the neighborhood of 800,000 admissions to hospitals and for perhaps 25,000 deaths in addition to many deaths ascribed to pneumonia but brought on as a result of influenza infection. With other respiratory diseases it caused about one-third of the total admissions for disease in 1918 and roughly 80 per cent of disease deaths. XIII. The Army's astoundingly good record on venereal disease during this war did not just happen. It is partly due to the vigorous programs of public health authorities and agencies concerned with venereal disease control, partly due to the Army's uncompromising and realistic attack on the problem. Cures: Sulfonamides are used for gonorrhea and cures run approximately 70 per cent in a period of ten days. While the treatment for syphilis requires a longer period, new techniques to shorten the time for treatment are in the process of development. More Facts: The armed forces now accept inductees with uncomplicated cases of venereal diseases because of the high percentage of cures. Since this group of infected inductees is eliminated from the overall figure, it can be said that less than 3 per cent of the personnel become infected with venereal disease in the course of a year.  Note: The Army's rate of infection was even higher in the last war, running at over 9 per cent in 1918... Over go men a year out of 1000. XIV. Psychoneurotic breakdowns are a problem in the present war, as they are in all wars. Causes: Military specialists have assigned many contributing factors to the increase of psychoneurotic breakdowns, not the least of which is the crescendo of noise and tension in modern warfare. The major cause seems to be, according to these experts, unusually prolonged exposure to combat conditions. Figures: A significant proportion of all casualties in combat are psychoneurotic. Definition: A psychoneurosis is the physical expression of mental conflict, and ls not a sign of cowardice. The soldier is torn between his desire to stay at his post, and his natural instinct to stay alive. In the face of extreme exhaustion this conflict may produce an acute anxiety state, paralysis or anesthesia, reactive depressions, from which the soldier may recover promptly with proper rest and care. Oo Sketch of My Life (Continued from page 136) ?containing a house which accommodated two families: one part opportunely made a home for a widowed sister with two children? the other, I rented. This, like many other trivial events in human life, proved to be one of the little hinges on which events of immense weight occasionally turn. My brother Lorenzo' was in a Presbyterian College. From his letters I learned that he was investigating their orthodoxy. At length he wrote me, saying, "If you have nothing better to offer than this, then good bye to all religions." I feared he was approaching the vortex of infidelity, and felt that the only rescue was in the unadulterated Gospel of Jesus Christ, and was anxious to induce him to come where he could see its workings and judge for himself. I wrote him he could have a home with my sister, if he would spend his College vacation with us. He came, and to improve the time he engaged in study under an efficient Hebrew Teacher,' who had opened a school for the benefit of the Saints in Kirtland, and while studying a dead language, he also studied the eternal principles of a living faith. He was baptized ?ordained an Elder, and is now [1885] one of the Twelve Apostles. Although this belongs to my brother's history, I consider it one of the events of my life, inasmuch as he has been a great benefit to me, as well as having been energetically useful in the cause which I esteem dearer than my mortal life.
