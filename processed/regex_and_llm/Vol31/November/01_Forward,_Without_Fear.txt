FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR THE next time she went to see Johanna she was lying exactly as she had been before. For the first time in her life the girl knew stark fear. She must get away from that bloodless, too quiet face on the pillow. Quickly she transferred the mosquito netting from the baby to Johanna. Then she hurried back to her writing, but she did not write. She felt an overwhelming desire to go for Mrs. Lewis. Once she started down the trail, but turned and came back. "I must not be a coward," she told herself. "I know Mrs. Lewis is plumb tired." But her nervousness increased, and when she saw Helga coming she was so relieved quick tears filled her eyes. She realized she was trembling all over. "Evening," she called loudly to hide her agitation. "You-all's been a long time coming." "I worked," Helga answered. "She didn't want any sewing done today so I washed. I think I worked harder than ever in my life." With someone present to assume responsibility, Patty Lou's fears were gone. Immediately she was her carefree self. "Another crazy gal," she cried scornfully. "I wouldn't do anybody's washing. Walk four miles and do a scrubbing just for the fun of being uncomfortable. I'd rather go home. That is why I am writing to papa. How much did she give you, thirty-five cents?" "Twenty-five," Helga corrected. Back in Loftshammar throw a fit, as you say, if they knew what the Mortensen girls were doing?" She nodded toward the shelter. "How is she?" 645 "Mighty poorly, but she is sleeping now. Mrs. Lewis will be back directly." Helga went in, and when she came back she had the baby. Crooning softly she held the tiny face up to her own. "She was stirring," she told Patty Lou. "I was afraid she would wake Johanna." Patty Lou smiled absently. She knew Helga's habit of making excuses for holding Baby Anna, but she was more interested in the basket Helga had brought home. "Did you-all buy something?" "Yes. I went by the trading post on my way home. It is just a piece of smoked salmon for Johanna. Doesn't it look good? It smells like home." The Southern girl wrinkled her nose contemptuously. "Fan me up a breeze. If Norway smells like that I am glad I'm from Alabama." She looked intently at the piece of fish. "I reckon you-all paid all your money for it. Why don't somebody buy something I like?" "How is she?" They turned and Niels was standing behind them. He looked wretched. He had lost his cap, and his thick hair was standing up in all directions. One sleeve of his shirt was torn and there was a skinned place on one cheek. His upper lip was cut and swollen. "Niels," Helga cried. "You have been fighting again." With a movement of utter despair he dropped to the stump and took his head between his hands. He groaned aloud. "What happened?" Helga asked. Something was always happening to Niels. His English had improved. 646 "I am unloading de boat." He used his huge hands to describe the lifting. "Big boxes. Big barrels." "But what happened?" "All day by me a man he talks, talks. All day I keep my hands down. Den he wishes he got one crack at de Mormon Prophet. I take one crack." Patty Lou laughed aloud. "I?ll bet it was a good one. How many teeth did you knock out?" Niels lifted his head. He grinned shyly. "I don't count. Dey come eight-ten. I fight good but de boss won't pay. I started de fight." It was an effort for Helga to speak cheerfully. "Never mind, we'll manage someway; but for Johanna's sake you should try harder. Sometimes I wish you couldn't understand English." He got up abruptly and started for the house, but Patty Lou caught his arm. "Wait a minute. Got the wash basin and towel for him. "Wash the blood and dirt off your face, and comb your hair." While he was washing, Helga took the baby inside. When she came back he was brushing ineffectually at his hair. "She is awake now. Go in and see her; but don't tell her about the fight." Only after he had gone did Patty Lou notice how drawn Helga's face was. Her eyes were wide with fear. "You better go for Sister Lewis." When Matilda Lewis came she said very little. To the girls' delight Johanna ate nearly half the small piece of fish. For days she-had taken nothing but water and a thin gruel. Mrs. Lewis' eyes were more watchful, if possible, but Niels and the girls relaxed. Niels gathered twigs to start their campfire, while Helga made preparations for their scanty meal. Patty fed the baby a little sweetened water from a spoon. Back along a road that roughly followed the river from Montrose, Ann Kristin was placing one weary foot ahead of another. To the east, the sun's slanting rays made a mirror of the water. Grimly she recalled her emotions when first she had looked across the Mississippi toward Nauvoo. She had stood on the wharf after leaving the River Maid, and in that moment the shining dreams of her girlhood had seemed realized. Life stretched before her, a radiant vista of love, peace, and security. Security was gone. Peace she had not yet found, and love?had she lost even love? "I could stand the poverty, the humiliation," she said aloud, "even my withered hand, if only I could do something about Elder Lewis." On her good arm she carried a basket, a replica of the one Helga had carried. Niels had woven them from willows. They carried them whenever they worked, for their pay was usually in produce. The soft clop of horses' hoofs made her look up. She stepped aside to let the buggy pass. Opposite her, the driver stopped his team abruptly. "Kristin. What on earth??" It was Thomas Bedloe. He stared at her in unbelief. "What in the world are you doing here?this way?" Ann Kristin had thrust her bad hand into the pocket of her skirt. "T have been looking for work," she answered, shortly. "But?you mean you walked to FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR Montrose to find work? You mean ?work?" His tone told her all he was thinking. "We must eat, although I have found we can get by with very little of it." Twisting his reins about the brake handle, Bedloe got out. "Allow me." He made as if to help her in the buggy. "I will drive you back." She did not move. "Thank you. I will walk." He studied her. She was very thin, and her bonnet did not entirely hide the effect of wind and sun on her hair. In her eyes a shadow had replaced the fun and laughter. The shadow was not fear, of that he was sure. It could be hurt. He spoke quickly. "Haven't you forgiven me yet? I have tried to explain, darling." "Explain. Will that get Elder Lewis out of jail? He didn't take that money, Tom. I know he didn't. Tell me one thing," she demanded suddenly, "when I signed that paper did you know they would arrest him?" "Must we go over that again? Can't you take my word for it?" "If you will give me your word. Did you or didn't you know they would arrest Elder Lewis?" She wanted desperately to hear him say he, like her, had been duped. She wanted to believe he had not tricked her. Watching her, Bedloe's eyes softened. "Darling, if I erred I did it be cause I loved you. I may have said more than I intended, but they have been hunting a chance to arrest someone. It is all part of the scheme to discourage us, For the 647 same reason his trial has been postponed time and time again." There was no mistaking the love and desire in his eyes. Ann Kristin felt her color rise. It was all so confusing. If he loved her, why had he allowed this thing to happen? More to herself than to him, she explained: "Some English I understand perfectly, but not legal terms ?and the way he fired questions at me was so confusing. I had no idea what I was doing. I have gone to them time and time again. I have tried to withdraw the complaint." "Darling! If you would only marry me as we had planned. You know I shall always love you. When we are married I will use my influence to get him released. I do have considerable influence in Montrose, you know. You are so uncomfortable. Come with me. I want to take care of you." The girl's eyes leaped with sudden hope. She hated this camp. She hated these coarse dusty clothes she wore. She hated asking for work and seeing disdain in the eyes of those she asked. Seeing her indecision, Bedloe intensified his persuasion. In the end she said: "Tomorrow I will give you my answer. Now I must walk and think." With a promise that he would see her tomorrow, he drove reluctantly away. When he had gone, she drew her hand from her pocket. She looked at it, and laughed harshly. It was not enough that she had lost her beloved Norway, her parents, her security. Now she must suffer this?this nightmare. And she must not let Tom see it until after?she must not tell him her beautiful belongings were gone?for food, for medicine, for those things 648 that sustained her physical body while her other self withered and died. She could not go on in this way, with no hope, no future. At the trading post she looked about for Niels. He had said he would be working at the wharf all day. She did not see him; but a number of men, evidently just off work, stared at her so boldly she pulled her bonnet closer about her face and hurried away. Then she thought she saw him between the brush on the trail that led to camp. She called and hurried to overtake him. He turned and too late she saw it was Matt Lewis. She had been carrying the basket on her sore arm; but now she shifted it quickly and put her hand in her pocket again. "I?I thought it was Niels," she stammered. "I was going to walk with him." "Won't I do?" He watched her closely. He thought, she has changed. She is still bitter?no, not bitter. Sick and discouraged. His quick glance saw the hand in her pocket. Rudely he snatched it and held it so he could look at it. Fingers were drawn and taut. "Are you using it?" he demanded. "T can't." For a full minute he did not answer. He turned her hand over. He flexed her fingers. He spoke, and there was command, reproof, and something she could not name in his voice. "That night when you were so ill and mother sent for me, I promised you something. Remember?" She nodded without speaking. "Then you must help. If your arm is to become whole you must The do as I said. The Lord expects us to do what we can." "It's no use," she cried rebelliously. "I have tried and it's no use. There is nothing for me but sorrow." For a moment they walked together in silence. He had not released her hand. "We can't understand completely," he said at length. "Perhaps you need a lesson in walking humbly, by faith." She snatched her hand away. Presently he saw her wipe her eyes. "What's the matter with Bedloe? I thought you would be married by now. Isn't he pressing his suit?" He threw the words at her. She did not know it, but the night she had been so ill had not been easy for him. Before he had administered to her he had gone off by himself. There on his knees he had asked that all rancor be removed from his heart, so there would be nothing between them to stay the answering of the blessing for her. His heart had been at peace, but now he was again restless and unhappy, but for a different reason. He did not want a woman who was in love with a scoundrel. "We may be married tomorrow," she answered, matching his tone. She did not look at him. "He is doing well now. He could give me a home." "Yes. He could give you a home. That is more than?many others could do. Just what does he do? I have never been able to find out definitely." "Why don't you ask him?" "I would if I could get close enough to him. He takes care to keep out of my way." No matter how they started, thev always ended by quarreling. Hei FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 649 heart ached for understanding and
peace. "How are conditions in Nauvoo? Could I get work there, now that my
hand is better?" ''Conditions are bad. I hear the charter may be repealed."
''What does that mean?" "More lawlessness, probably more deaths among the brethren. Certainly, another move. Our patience and forbearance are being taxed beyond endurance." As they came into the clearing, Helga looked up from the corncakes she was cooking. Ann Kristin handed her the basket. "Ann Kristin Mortensen, where did you get this food? Fish, hominy, potatoes? even a little salt pork. You could not have earned this much in three days. Where did you get it?" "I'll explain later." Patty Lou took the basket from Helga, and started for the table. "Jake came," she called over her shoulder. "He's behind the lean-to talking to Niels.? ?I?ll see them.? Matt started toward the thicket, but stopped short. Coming up the trail were two men. They were the same two officers who had  arrested his father two months before. "Be careful what you say," he warned the girls. (To be continued) Money Isn't Everything (Continued from page 619) and suddenly, like a rising fog, doubt and misgiving welled up in her being to veil the shining splendor of her new-found happiness. She shook herself mentally, and
was surprised to note the letter, still unopened, in her hand. The missive was hastily scrawled and difficult to decipher. Halfway down the page, a paragraph focused and held her attention. "I hate to tell you this, but George and I are getting a divorce. He is going back to the ranch. I am to keep the boy. He's quite a handful ? been running around nights while I am at work, and got into some trouble. I am worried sick about him. Please do hurry and come out.
When you get here with Dick, I think Junior will be more content to stay in evenings. He and Dick always got along so well together, and-" "Hi, Mom," called Dick from the gate, "Dad says you can pack his jeans, too. He's going with us! Isn't that swell?? Suppressing a wild impulse to laugh and cry at the same time, Alice rallied her faculties to call back saucily, "Tell your dad, young man,
that I've no time to be taking any such orders from him. I'm going to be busy unpacking.

RELIEF SOCIETY WAR AND WELFARE SERVICES IN MISSIONS (Continued from Magazine for October) Canadian Mission JESSIE R. URSENBACH, president of the Canadian Mission Relief Society, writes as follows concerning the "Bundles for Britain" project which is carried on by the Relief Society women of this mission: "During the Battle of Britain, when hearts and homes of members of this mission were severely torn, the idea of sending bundles to Britain was born. Sister Johan Mark, a faithful member from Scotland whose own mother died as a result of the blitz, was the originator of the idea, with the approval and full support of the mission presidents, President David A. Smith and Sister Emily Smith and of their successors, the late President Joseph Quinney and Sister Ida Quinney. "Twenty pounds per month was the amount allowed by shipping authorities, so early in this year, when President Octave W. Ursenbach was appointed as mission president and Sister Jessie R. Ursenbach was set apart to preside over the Relief Societies, letters were sent out to all Relief Societies, requesting that this be made a mission project. 'Showers for Britain' in connection Page 650 with their annual day commemorations were suggested, so that there would be plenty of clothing always ready, and the bundles could be sent out as regularly and as often as permitted.; "The letters met with enthusiastic co-operation, and, very soon, bundles large and small began arriving at the mission home. Many organizations sent several beautiful bundles. They were filled with warm, clean necessities for the newborn, and for children mostly from six to ten years of age, with some for adults as well. 'The care with which they were prepared bore eloquent testimony of the loving mother-hearts behind the project. Everything was clean and ready for shipment. "Each bundle was accompanied by a postal note of three dollars, the sum necessary to insure its delivery to Britain. In some cases the second bundle with the second postal note arrived from the same organization, and always with some expression; such as, 'When you need more, let us know,' "We are already preparing winter things,' or 'We will soon send another bundle of things to you.' "The joy of Relief Society sisters in preparing these bundles has been expressed by letter, verbally, and by the tiny stitches, touches of delicate embroidery, and individuality that went into their careful preparation.

We know this service has drawn our sisters who have participated closer together in a bond of mutual companionship, such as can be found only where unselfish, loving service is given in a worthy human cause. "The bundles go out regularly, and Sister Ursenbach and her willing, enthusiastic workers are trying to arrange with the shipping authorities to send them oftener, that the needs of our dear ones over there who suffer may be filled as have the hearts of the Canadian sisters who have so lovingly, willingly given."

The Oshawa Branch Relief Society, Canadian Mission, although sustained by only four members and two missionaries, has been exceptionally co-operative in the mission-wide "Bundles for Britain" project. The Oshawa sisters found it very difficult to raise the $3 needed to dispatch each bundle, but they made and sold aprons and obtained funds to finance a second bundle. Of the fifteen Societies in the mission, Oshawa was the only one which sent double
its quota, when the first bundles were received at mission headquarters. Sister Esther Ward, seated center, very happily offers her home or the meetings. She is 84 years of age.

American Mission, standing service in teaching sewing skills to the women through the medicles and also Containing recipes, other useful folders ate provided so that each member may have <t Personal copies of these mimeostaphed sheets. In her travels throughout the mis. Sion, Sister Jones carries several exhibits in order to demonstrate to the kindly Prepared a description of each these articles in sufficient detail to help others desiring to adopt these Suggestions, Supplementing the Photograph are sketches showing utilization of a man's used shirt for an oatmeal carton, three-pound s1ze, covered with crash decorated with bright touches of embroidery and 654 Diagram showing the cutting of dust cap, half sleeves, child?s panties and baby rompers from man?s used shirt, applique from old felt hats. After learning to make the fitted bottom for this bag, the women have been able to adapt the idea in making
fitted coverings for chairs, suitcases, et cetera. The attractive cord for the bag, made of two colors of silkaline, twisted on the wheel of a sewing machine, has stimulated the making of similar cords for dress trimmings, curtain tiebacks, strings for children's mittens, and many other purposes. On July 27, Sister Jones wrote: "Since April conference, I have visited every Relief Society in the mission and every district where we have Relief Society sisters, even
though they have no organization whatever. We are losing our elders rapidly, and are closing a number of districts within the next week or so, but, in the face of all of it, conditions in the Relief Societies are very much on the upturn. We have had good attendance, there being a total of 389 in attendance at Relief Society meetings over the mission. This is better than 100 more than our total enrollment, which shows that our sisters have done a splendid piece of work in interesting investigators. ?Every Relief Society now owns a quilting frame excepting Mercedes, Texas, and they could not buy lumber as there isn't a foot of it in the town. Every Relief Society has made one quilt and sent to mission headquarters, and all are now working on comforters or quilts for their own
members. The project is going over even better than I could have hoped for. 654 Articles from Several Exhibits Used by Ivie H. Jones, Mission Relief Society President, in the Relief Societies of the Spanish-American Mission. (See accompanying detailed descriptions) NOTES FROM THE FIELD 655 EXHIBIT 1?ARTICLES FROM USED FELT HATS ARTICLE 1?HAT MADE FROM MAN'S HAT: (a) Sweat band removed; (b) Crown folded at top of ribbon band, and then crown turned inside out; (c) Brim tilted slightly in front and bright red feather slipped under ribbon band at side front. Time required, exclusive of cleaning?two minutes. ARTICLE 2?CROWN OF MAN'S BLACK HAT AND WOMAN'S WHITE HAT MAKE THIS CREATION: Crown on man's hat was badly worn at the crease on top so a freehand design was cut out and stitched by hand onto the crown of the white hat. Horsehair braid bow in front. ARTICLES 3, 4?BABY SHOES: Brims of both hats were used for baby shoes. Surplus of crown of man's hat used for toe piece of shoe, since brim was rather stiff for that purpose. ARTICLE 5?KNITTING BAG: Tan crash bag with design made from used felt hats, slipped over a 3-pound oatmeal carton. Fitted bottom and double drawstring at top made of two colors of silkaline are neat features. Drawstring is twisted on wheel of sewing machine. EXHIBIT 2?ARTICLES MADE OF MAN'S SHIRT Many useful articles can be made from a used shirt; however, like many other pieces of used clothing, if the shirt must be ripped, recut, and finishings made, the material will not justify the labor. These particular articles are designed to take advantage of seams, hems, buttonholes, etc. ARTICLE 6?HALF SLEEVES TO WEAR IN GARDEN: Shirt sleeve is cut just below worn part at elbow. Hem at top and use elastic if available. ARTICLE 7?CHILD'S PANTIES: Made from upper part of sleeves. Bottom of leg comes at elbow of sleeve, each sleeve making one pantie leg. No ripping necessary.  ARTICLE 8?BABY ROMPERS: Shirt is usually worn at neck where collar touches. (a) Cut just above first buttonhole, making back neck of rompers. Then straight out to arms eye seam. This felled seam makes the hem on the bottom of the sleeve, (b) The front of the shirt makes the back of the romper and the back makes the front. Gathers and top-smocking at neck uses the surplus fullness across back of shirt. The only hand work is stitching on the loop at the bottom of front piece and embroidering top-smocking at neck. ARTICLE 9?DUST CAP: Made of front tail of shirt sewed together. Do not cut off hem. The yoke of the shirt, merely bound at the neck with bias tape where collar was removed, completes the front turnback. ARTICLE 10?WOMAN'S BEDROOM SLIPPERS: Top made from used khaki color work shirt and sole from light shirt too worn for other purposes. Sole is tightly braided and braid turned on end and sewed to form sole. Slipper is lined with felt from used hat. EXHIBIT 3?ARTICLES MADE FROM MEN'S TROUSERS ARTICLE 11-?-LITTLE BOY'S LONG-BIB PANTS AND MITTENS: Made of scraps are lined with dark gray outing flannel. ARTICLE 12?SEWING OR SHOPPING BAG: Outside of bag made from brown corduroy trousers. Lining from rayon underwear dyed orange. Handles are shoe trees painted orange, and design is made from dyed yarn from old sweaters. ARTICLE 13?MAN'S BEDROOM SLIPPERS: Wooden sole with leather hinge. Top of slipper made from worn trousers, merely tacked onto sole. EXHIBIT 4?CARE OF CLOTHING ARTICLE 14?SUIT OR DRESS COVER: Excellent item for any household. Requires 2 yards of 36" material, and 11/2 yards of bias tape for binding opening. Top shaped to fit hanger. Saves many cleaning bills. ARTICLE 15?DOUBLE HOSE BAG: Made of flour sack or any other similar material. Three pieces of material 18x18 inches required. Cut to fit plain wooden hanger. Front and back have oval openings for inserting hose. Third piece left plain for partition. Design and letters are made with crayola steamed in. Lettering on the one side is "darned" and on the other "undarned." 'This bag makes an excellent non-snag container that can hang in clothes closet. MISCELLANEOUS EXHIBITS ARTICLE 16?GIRL'S SPORT SLIPPER: Made of cat-tail stems braided 3, 4, and 6 strands. Braid sewed on end to join sole; edge of sole and the decoration is painted after shoe is completed. ARTICLE 17?CHILD'S SLEEVELESS SHIRT: When union suits are completely worn out, the slanted flaps make lapped shirt fronts, with original hems at edges. Bind neck and armholes. There will usually be the part that folds across the back still worth using. Shirt may be fastened by string, snap, or button. The cuff part of the sleeves or legs could make sleeves for this shirt by merely stretching or fulling into armhole, leaving finished edge at bottom of sleeve. ARTICLES 18, 19, 20, 21, 22?POT HOLDERS: Materials required: One-half of a wash cloth, 2 yards of six-ply embroidery thread, piece of inner tube for lining, raveled twine from flour sack for ring at top, and pieces of bias tape or other colorful material for trimmings. Because of the scarcity of rubber, we will have to forego this luxury for the duration. Inner tube can be used over and over with different covers. It prevents burning the hands and goes through the washer and wringer making ironing unnecessary. Rubber squares in these particular pieces are fully ten years old. If you ever use them, you'll never want any other kind of pot holder. Ironing Procedures
Claire P. Dorius
Equipment: Much of the drudgery of ironing is eliminated if one has the proper equipment. The ironing board should be well padded, firmly mounted, and a comfortable height. The pad should be covered with a smooth, clean cover.
Arrange equipment conveniently?the dampened clothes at the left on a chair or low table to prevent bending over; and the clothes rack to the right within easy reach. Have a supply of coat hangers at hand. Hangers for blouses, shirts, and dresses will save time and preserve the appearance and shape of the garment.
Sprinkle and smooth out wrinkles. Proper sprinkling, removing of unnecessary wrinkles, and rolling up garments will cut down ironing time considerably and produce better results. To dampen clothes use a bottle with a perforated top or an ordinary whisk broom. Use warm water. It penetrates the fabric more readily. Be sure that all parts are lightly and evenly dampened. If possible, roll up clothes in a rubber sheet for even distribution of moisture. Let stand for at least two hours or overnight if possible. But not longer than twenty-four hours as mildewing may set in.
To conserve on fuel, begin ironing fabrics that need low heat. It is easier to iron collars, cuffs, sleeves, belts, and trimmings before the flat sections of the garment.
Cottons and linens (white and colored) are ironed on the right side, and dark-colored ones, silks and rayons on the wrong side. Table linens are ironed first on the right and then on the wrong side. Change the place for folds in the flat pieces to preserve the life of the material. Each piece should dry thoroughly before putting away. Most irons or ironers have heat control indicators, follow these carefully. If not, the following temperatures have been found to be the most satisfactory: Cottons and linens need relatively high heat; wool and silk moderate heat; rayon, low heat. If the material is acetate rayon very low heat is needed. Combinations of fibers?adjust heat to fiber that requires the lowest temperature.
If you have a mangle, learn to use it efficiently. It will take care of all the flat pieces and many other pieces as skill in its use is developed. Table cloths should be folded selvedge to selvedge, right side out. Iron first on one side and then on the other. Fold again lengthwise and iron on both sides again?fold to put away.
Curtains may need to be dried on curtain stretchers. It is necessary, of course, that the stretchers be adjusted evenly to get satisfactory results. However, many of the curtain panels that are for sale at the present time, do not require any stretching or stretching. These fine rayon fabrics should never be exposed to excessive heat or sunlight because they are apt to deteriorate. Such curtains should never be allowed to become very soiled. They should be washed in a mild soapsuds by squeezing through and through the material. Rinse very thoroughly but carefully. Do not 658 wring or pull or rub. Roll in a turkish towel when wet and knead out the moisture. Fold in the center lengthwise and iron with a warm iron. Never use a hot iron. Some panels look well if hung between two curtain rods until almost dry and then pressed. Men's soft shirts: Begin by ironing the yoke first on the wrong side and then on the right. Next the collar, first the wrong side, then right side until perfectly dry, pulling tightly and working from the points in. Iron neckband completely dry. Shape collar by hand, iron edge of crease. For the front and back, first iron the back, then buttonhole side of front, then button side. Iron both sides of front pleat, holding it firmly to prevent wrinkles. Then iron the sleeves. First the cuffs, ironing the same as the collar. Nose iron up into the gathers. Straighten sleeves from underarm seam; iron on both sides. Iron underarm seam dry. Button the collar before putting the shirt on a hanger. Pressing: The pressing cloth should have a smooth weave free from lint. Light-weight muslin and sateen are very good. If the garment to be pressed is very heavy, more than one thickness of pressing cloth will be needed. When pressing a woolen fabric, place the garment on the ironing board so that the yarns in the weave run straight. Each time you shift the garment be sure the yarns lie straight. Dampen the pressing cloth lightly and evenly; place it on the wrong side of the garment to be pressed. Use a medium hot iron. Press down lightly on the iron; lift it and press down on the next section. Do not move the iron as you do in ironing. Do not press until the cloth is dry. The garment should be moist when you have finished pressing it; then hung on a coat hanger to dry. Miscellaneous Blanket Care?15 things to remember: Wash only one blanket at a time. Make rich heavy suds with mild, alkaline-free soap or flakes. Be sure soap is thoroughly dissolved before adding blanket. Soften the water?keep temperature 100?F. If using washing machine do not let it run more than 3 minutes, by hand not more than 3 to 5 minutes, no longer. Never rub or scrub a blanket. If blanket is still soiled, repeat the process. After washing, squeeze water from blanket, never twist. Loosen the roller in the wringer. To dry?hang blanket lengthwise across two lines. Pull it gently into shape. Blankets dry best on mild breezy days. Never hang in extreme cold or heat. References: "Life Insurance for Your Washables," White King Soap Company.

SUPERSCRIPTION Jessie Miller Robinson As long ago, a monk with patient strokes of care Rubbed out a worldly ode to cover with a prayer The priceless vellum; Lord, I ask thee to erase All wrong desire, and write pure Love upon my face, -Theology Church History Lesson 5?The Kirtland Period Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, February 6, 1945 Objective: To study the beginning of the "rising up and the coming forth of my church out of the wilderness" (Doc. And Cov. 5:14). THE spring of 1830 found the Church of Jesus Christ organized again upon the earth. The pattern was once more outlined whereby men could enter the kingdom through faith, repentance, and the waters of baptism, which rebirth then brought confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost. These four simple acts provided a way SO clear that none could err therein. Yet they were profound enough to touch the lives of all living souls even to the four corners of the earth. God had promised believers that "signs would follow" those who did his will which now could be explained by his authorized servants who held the Holy Priesthood. The promise was that his church should "rise up and come forth out of the wilderness." This was an inspiring yet awesome thought. To those who had embraced the new faith and reflected upon its. Wonders, the following reason became apparent. 'The Lord had said the church of men had forms of godliness but denied the power thereof. Could he therefore plant a personal testimony in the hearts of those who were to seek him through the leaders of Christendom who sought not his will but their own? No, the truth must come through humble men whom the world called weak and despised, men of the earth, nourished as it were in the wilderness, apart from the more frequented paths of social life. His voice again would come through such servants crying repentance. If it was hard, as we have seen, for the first favored members of the "little flock" to believe, what then might be expected of others, unschooled in the ways of the Lord, who were to hear the gospel message? Often changes in life are painful even if all the evidence for such changes is apparent. In temporal matters the need for new patterns of living often reveal themselves, but in things of the spirit, only those Page 659 660 who are willing through faith to learn, may see. The Church was organized but its paths ahead were to lead through the struggling ways of little known regions. On Sunday, April 11, 1830, the first public meeting of the organized Church of Jesus Christ was held. Oliver Cowdery, its second elder, delivered its first public discourse. Six new members were baptized that day, and seven the following Sunday in Lake Seneca. Later in the month, Joseph Smith held meetings in the home of Joseph Knight at Colesville, Broome County, New York. It was during these meetings that Newel Knight, a son of Joseph Knight, became possessed of a devil which the Prophet cast out. Newel had promised to pray in the meeting before his friends, but became timid when the time arrived. Still exhibiting faith in the power of God, he sought his Maker in the woods nearby, at which time he was possessed by the evil spirit. So miraculous was his healing, that he and many of those present, who witnessed the event, later became members of the Church. This first miracle of the Church, it should be noted, followed as a sign for those who had believed and attended the meetings. It did not come to satisfy the skepticism of scoffers. Things of wonder spread rapidly. "A church of miracles and a new Bible," went the word over the countryside. Both at Colesville, where he had been, and at Fayette to which place he returned, the talk of strange things came back to the Prophet. On the first day of June 1830, the first conference of the Church was held in Fayette. The outpouring of the Spirit was rich. Many baptisms followed. After the conference Joseph returned again to his home in Pennsylvania, and soon after this, with his wife, he went once more to the home of Joseph Knight in Colesville where he found many who believed ready for baptism. Plans were laid for a service. And a dam was constructed. A mob of the neighborhood set to work tearing this dam away. 'The service which was to have been held on a Sunday was of necessity postponed until Monday. Peace was not to be had from then on at the Knight home. During another visit from the Prophet a mob surrounded the house. Joseph faced the angry men in vain, endeayoring to pacify them. Events moved on, culminating in the arrest of the Prophet on two different occasions while serving the Colesville Branch. At the end of both trials he was set free, nothing having been proved against him. During these troublesome times the Lord remained close to Joseph revealing to him his mind and will. At the Whitmer home, with the assistance of his wife and David Whitmer, the early revelations were arranged and copied. In June of this year came what is known as the "Visions of Moses" (Pearl of Great Price, p. 1). August brought another visit from a heavenly messenger with instructions concerning the administration of the Lord's Supper (Doc. And Cov., Sec. 27:1-4). It was in this month of the year, too. That the break occurred between Joseph and his father-in-law, Mr. Isaac Hale, and the Prophet and his wife Emma went to live at the Whitmers. Things in Fayette were not all favorable for Joseph. Dissensions LESSON DEPARTMENT had arisen among his followers there due to a stone in the possession of Hiram Page, one of the eight' witnesses of the plates of the Book of Mormon. Spurious revelations had misled many, even some of the most prominent members, such as Oliver Cowdery. In the name of the Lord the Prophet informed his friends that these writings were from Satan, and called upon Oliver to induce Hiram Page to do away with the stone and all it had brought. This was done with the result that a complete settlement of differences then existing in the Church followed (Doc. And Cov. 28:1-8). In the revelation concerning the matter of the stone, the Lord also called Oliver Cowdery on a mission to the Lamanites. 'There was a positive look forward in this revelation. If in one way his purposes apparently are thwarted, he will accomplish them in another. Throughout the early rising of his church in the wilderness there are many instances of this. Often in the very midst of trouble and dissensions among the saints, would come the call to new and distant fields of service. The Lord knew where his sheep were willing and ready to hear his voice, and would instruct the servants of his organized Church to carry the message to them. Those who were big enough to heed his word and rise above their petty grievances, lived to bring added joy to their own testimonies, and strength to the Church through new converts. The promised gathering of Israel lay at the base of these missionary journeys (Doc. And Cov. 10:65-66). With the missionary zeal that followed, a flood of new names was entered upon the Church. Many 661 of these became forever a part of the Mormon story that goes to make up the rise of the early Church of Jesus Christ in the fullness of times. Parley P. Pratt is one such name, This man, born April 12, 1807 in Otsego County, New York, and later a resident of Ohio, had returned to the East as a Campbellite minister. While on his journey he saw for the first time a copy of the Book of Mormon. He became converted, and joined the Church on the first of September 1830. In October of 1830, Parley P. Pratt was called with Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer Jr., and Ziba Peterson to carry out the first mission to the Lamanites earlier revealed to Oliver Cowdery (Doc. And Cov. 32). It was on this mission which took the elders through Kirtland, the town near which Parley P. Pratt had owned a home in Ohio, that he visited his friend Sidney Rigdon. Other prominent Church leaders in addition to Rigdon were brought into the faith as a result of this mission, such men as: Isaac Morley, John Murdock, Lyman Wight, Edward Partridge, Frederick G. Williams, and Newel K. Whitney. All joined the Church and helped to provide a haven of refuge, even though but temporary, for the Prophet and his followers in the East, who, because of bitter persecution, were finally given the command to "assemble together at the Ohio" (Doc. And Cov. "But beyond Kirtland traveled this first party of elders. They passed through Sandusky, Ohio, thence to Cincinnati, to St. Louis, and finally on to Independence, Jackson County, Missouri. On this trip in addition to converting hundreds of souls 662 to the Church and establishing many branches, they presented the message of the Book of Mormon to the Catteraugus Indians near Buffalo, New York, the Wyandots near Sandusky, Ohio, and to the Indians of the plains, the Delawares, across the Kansas River. In February of 1831, it was decided that Parley P. Pratt should return to Kirtland with the great news of the mission just completed. Upon his arrival in March he found the Prophet there to greet him, Joseph having come because of the wish of the Lord which was made known during the third conference of the Church held January 2, 1831, at Fayette. In Ohio, he had said, the law of God should be given them and they should be endowed with power from on high. The Kirtland period of the Church which rose "clear as the moon" is so richly filled with the wonders of his word, that not one, nor dozens of lessons could adequately cover it. We shall have occasion to study more in detail at a later time the far reaching results of the few years roughly between 1831 and 1838, that go to make up the first large gathering of the saints in the country called Ohio. To name the more important things that occurred in or about this beautiful town of Kirtland will quicken the imagination of any Latter-day Saint. The Presiding Bishopric was organized; the Law of Consecration or the United Order was introduced; the first distinctive ordination to the office of High Priest was made; the Word of Wisdom was given; the First Presidency of the Church was organized; the first High Council of the Church was called; Zion's Camp, of which we will hear more in the next lesson, was marshalled; the Twelve Apostles were chosen, as also were the first and second quorums of Seventies; the Pearl of Great Price was translated; the Doctrine and Covenants was presented to the general assembly of the Church; and, as the crowning achievement of this period, the first temple to the Lord in the fullness of times was erected March 27, 1836. Only through the failure of the saints as a whole to comply with the commandments of the Lord did dissension and financial difficulties arise, which brought on bitter persecution for all, eventual apostasy for many, and removal to Missouri for those who'remained faithful. Yet even in the most bitter days of failure for this Kirtland period, the Lord set his people face forward again by commanding three of his apostles? Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, and Willard Richards to open a new vineyard on the foreign soil of England. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for our life in this day. 1. When the President of the Church rises to address a general conference session he may be looked upon as any of the great seers of ancient Israel. Why? At the third conference of the Church held on January 2, 1831, at Fayette, New York, section 38 of the Doctrine and Covenants was: given in the presence of those LESSON DEPARTMENT assembled. Read this section and pay particular attention to verse 32. What two things are promised the saints in this verse? 2. How does the higher law as given by Christ embrace the lesser law?the Ten Commandments? The fulfillment of the first promise made in verse 32, that pertaining to the law, came, and is recorded in section 42. This section is fraught with great meaning for all who have taken upon them the name of the Lord. Its careful study will show Christ's love and mercy offered to those who will strive ever to keep the law. The fulfillment of the second promise is recorded in part in section 110. Read this section in class. 663 The next question may be used if needed for further class activity or it may be assigned for home study. Read the beautiful dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple, section 109. Extra readings: sections 28:14-16; 30, 32?the call of the first missionaries to the Lamanites; sections 34; 35; 36?the word of the Lord to Orson Pratt, Sidney Rigdon, and Edward Partridge; section 52?the sending of missionaries forth, following the fourth conference held in Kirtland, June 6, 1831, to assemble again in conference next at Missouri.

The Beatitudes Lesson 5?Blessed Are the Merciful Elder Bryant S. Hinckley For Tuesday, February 6, 1945 "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (Matthew 5:7; III Nephi, 12:7). Objective: To show that mercy, essential to God's plan, is an ennobling quality important in our relationships with our fellow men. O be merciful is to have a heart made warm with the sunshine of kindness. If we are merciful, we search for the best in our fellows, instead of the worst; we seek extenuating circumstances, rather than incriminating ones; we are slow to condemn, and quick to commend. Mercy is a spontaneous expression of a loving heart. If we are merciful, we naturally think and say the best possible of our erring brother. When justice is meted out, we all plead for it to be tempered with mercy. Alma in speaking to his son Corianton expounded the doctrine of justice and mercy. (See Alma 42) The divine injunction to be merciful is magnificently expounded in Shakespeare's portrayal of the 664 character of Shylock in the Merchant of Venice?when Shylock demands his pound of flesh because the bond prescribes that he may do so. Then it is that Shakespeare puts into the mouth of the noble Portia these eloquent words: The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice bless'd; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. "Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes The throned monarch better than _ his crown; His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God's, When mercy seasons justice. (Merchant of Venice, Act 4, Scene I) The way to obtain mercy is to exercise it toward others. Let us be -assured that any man or woman who cherishes resentments and grudges, and who is intolerant toward others, is closing the door that opens the way to his own forgiveness, for in the final analysis the feelings that are in our own souls, the emotions that play upon our hearts determine whether or not we shall be the recipients of the mercy of God, and upon this rests our own forgiveness and our exaltation.

Driggs For Tuesday, February 20, 1945 LIKE four fine voices singing in harmony, the four writers of the Gospels blend in their portrayal of the life and the message of the Savior. Each of them has his own individual approach and style in dealing with varied phases of the sacred theme; yet all are in unison, Matthew, for example, seems to take special interest in the sermons and sayings of the Master; Mark seems to have found joy in preserving significant incidents in the life of Jesus; Luke, as said in a previous lesson, was concerned primarily with writing the events and the words of the Master in sequence?as living history; John devoted himself more - It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 36-38. LESSON DEPARTMENT to interpreting the spiritual life and the divine message of the Savior. It is only natural that from the "beloved disciple" we should get this more intimate portrayal. Of all those privileged to enjoy the friendship and confidence of the Master, none seemed to be held closer than John. He was a part of the family circle. Even on the cross the Savior committed to this devoted follower the care of his own mother; and from that time Mary lived in the home of John. The affection of the Savior for this disciple is brought to us with occasional delicate touches in the Gospel of St. John. Every chapter of this uplifting record also brings one nearer to the inner meaning of the gospel as it was taught and lived by the Son of God. Its opening lines give the keynote, and the central theme of the remarkable book? In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not (John 1:1-5). Throughout this Gospel it is the truth that Jesus Christ was the veritable Son of God, one with the Father from the beginning?that is constantly impressed in word and deeds. Recognition of this divine truth is given at the outset by John the Baptist, who first announced himself as "the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord." And later, when Jesus appears, he says, "Behold the 665 Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" Following this incident, with swift strokes, John tells in his Gospel of the calling of the apostles, of the recognition by Peter and Nathanael of the Messiah. He depicts the first miracle?that of changing the water into wine, then he tells of the cleansing of the temple by the Savior, who with righteous indignation says to the money changers, "Take these things hence; make not my Fathers house an house of merchandise." After this comes another incident which adds emphasis to the fact that Jesus was indeed the Christ. Nicodemus, a Pharisee and a ruler of the Jews, comes in the night seeking wisdom from Jesus, and says, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him." And Jesus, instructing this leader, tells him among other things, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." (John 3: 16). Another incident related by John is that of the "Woman at the Well." To this woman, one of the Samaritans, a mixed race despised by the Jews, Jesus not only gives spiritual counsel, but tells her that he is the long-looked-for Messiah. Throughout the Gospel of Saint John, this truth is impressed and reimpressed. Moreover, the divinity of the work of the Savior is brought forth in many oft-quoted lines. The emphasis in this Gospel is on the spiritual, the inner meaning of the message Christ brought to the 666 world. Following are some sayings to illustrate the point: Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:5). The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise (John 5:19). I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me (John 5:30). If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself (John 7:17). Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me (John 7:33)- Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also (John 8:19). And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (John 8:32). It is truths such as these, presented simply and impressively, that bring one closer to the inner meaning of the gospel. From a literary viewpoint, the Gospel of St. John is less Hebraic and more Grecian in form. Matthew, for example, has the basic characteristics of Hebrew wisdom literature, presenting the teachings of Christ in proverb-like sentences. With John there is more continuity, discussion of the principles presented. The Master is portrayed as an interpreter of the truths he would give to the world. He reasons with those who seek to understand. He meets the Pharisees on their own ground, anticipates and answers their questions, aimed at trapping him with his own words. And during these discussions, he frequently voices gems of truth. Following are a few of these precious sayings: While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light (John 12:36). For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always (John 12:8). My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me (John 7:16). Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me (John 5:39). I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live (John 11:25). Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you (John 14:27). If ye love me, keep my commandments (John 14:15) Our indebtedness to John is great. He has preserved for us many priceless sayings of the Savior. A closer view is given us by this "beloved disciple" of Jesus presenting principles of the gospel. Added to this we have in the Gospel of St. John a number of incidents in the life of the Master not recorded in the other Gospels?stories that enrich and illuminate his life and work. Dr. Dinsmore says of this author: He (John) was persuaded that Jesus, the Christ, was the Son of God, the Eternal Word.... The Eternal Light shines in the world's darkness?it divides men into the children of light and of darkness; the many love the darkness, but those who receive the light become the Sons of God..... This book has no analogue either in ancient or in modern times. A drama, cosmic in its range, written by a Hebrew in the Greek manner, of lucid profundity, the most disturbing, the most comforting of all books, filled with sadness, filled with hope, love pervading it as an atmosphere, LESSON DEPARTMENT 667 It is the Church's Most precious Spiritual document. To feel the uplift, the strength, the literary artistry of the gospel literature given to us by the ''beloved disciple," one must read and reread it with receptive mind and heart. John caught the divine import of the life and work of our Savior; and he portrayed the Son of God living and teaching truth? expounding through word and deed the way of salvation for all mankind. With artistic touches, with devotion to the sacred theme, he has bequeathed to the world a drama of divine love. 1, (a) Point out briefly individual in-terests or characteristics of each of the four authors of the Gospels.

Social Science Modern Applications of Ethical Principles Lesson 4?Freedom and Responsibility Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, February 27, 1945  Lesson Link, One month ago we took a mental an verbal survey of the road to righteousness. "It thinking and talking about it. Action and achievement beyond the ordinary, initiative, effort, accomplishment, these are the things that form the background to the moral life. Righteousness is a process; and he is best who keeps moving and who moves the farthest in the upward direction. Lesson aim. To show that freedom an that consequences follow acts; and that individuals are, therefore, morally responsible for their acts. IF the world is to be made any better or any happier than itis now, it will only be through some great moral reawakening. As long as large numbers of people live blindly, lazily, and selfishly, with little thought for tomorrow and little concern over improvement, humanity will continue to flounder in darkness and despair. As we have seen, it is only through intelligent creative effort that righteousness and supreme happiness are made possible. Creative activity springs from the free agency of man, but even it may become dissipated and perverted unless tempered and controlled by the spirit of responsibility. It is through the effort born of freedom and nurtured on responsibility that the greatest good is brought about and the greatest joy realized. Uses and Abuses of Freedom Man is a free agent capable of weighing alternatives, making decisions, and acting according to his choice. The question of whether man should be free in this way or should be compelled in all things was decided a long time ago in the council in heaven (Moses 4:1-4). And the decision there was a wise one, for out of free agency comes the opportunity for growth and righteous living. There are some who believe that man is not free in the way that we have explained here, but a little thought should dispel any doubt on this point. Some claim that since everything has a cause man is forced to act in the way he does act by the multiplicity of causes which have gone before. Man is not responsible for his thoughts and actions, they say, for both thoughts and actions are predetermined by all that precedes them. But no! This cannot be, for while it is true that everything has a cause, yet there must have been a first cause uncontrolled by precedents. Man is more than a piece of clay molded by circumstances, more than a puppet manipulated by fate. Man is a free agent, influenced by circumstances to be sure, but capable of rising above them. There is a spontaneity, a creative urge, a free agency (call it what you will) within the soul of every man that permits him to decide where he will go, and which makes him master of his own fate. If this were not so there would be little need to talk about morality and ethics, for regardless of the state of man's progress or happiness he could do nothing about it. He would be predestined to the fate before him and in the whirl of circumstances he would stand helpless. But ?fortunately such is not the case. Man does have the power to choose freely, and thereby to lift himself above the forces that would pull him down. Man is a creator; like God potentially. These fatalistic and deterministic  LESSON DEPARTMENT philosophies which picture man as a mere cog in a machine, devoid of free choice and free action, make the concept of ethics impossible and those of right and wrong ridiculous. Morality is based upon a scheme of free agency which lets man choose, but makes him responsible for the way he chooses. Though he may be foreordained, man is never predestined; though influenced by circumstances, man is never controlled entirely by them. The final choice is always up to the individual, freed of all compulsion, and that, of course, is why the individual is always responsible. Freedom, then, is a fact that makes moral responsibility imperative. But there is a tendency, widespread among us, to seek the privileges that freedom affords without accepting the responsibilities involved. It should be realized that freedom and responsibility are inseparably connected. It is impossible to have one without the other, and to try to do so is immoral. But people do try to dodge responsibility, and here are some of the ways: (1) They misinterpret freedom to mean the absence of all restraint and then, in their attempt to have it, they oppose all discipline and control from the outside. This is a distortion of the very meaning of freedom, for it selfishly sidesteps responsibility to others. Carried to its logical end it would mean anarchy and nihilism. Social restraints, whether imposed by parents, governments, or other agencies, are for the good of the individual as well as the group, and those who seek to throw them off often end up at the bottom of the hill. Freedom from the power and pull of evil is the final 669 goal to be sought and it can never be reached by indulgence. (2) They consider themselves to be victims of circumstances and in the spirit of self-justification and self-pity they throw off responsibility by offering excuses and blaming others. This is wrong, for it fails to recognize that, in the final analysis, it is the individual that chooses and is responsible. (3) They sometimes blame the devil for their weaknesses and immoral acts, failing to realize that, while the devil can lead, it is only they who can decide to follow. All in all, it can be said that if the intrinsic relationship between freedom and responsibility were more thoroughly understood, the world would be a better place in which to live. There are obligations involved in every privilege we accept, whether we like it ornot. The free agency with which we are endowed may be either an opportunity or a liability depending on how responsible we are in the use of it. Actually, there are no rights without responsibilities, and those who try to live as if there were will find themselves held doubly responsible when the final score is added up. A Moral Law For the Universe There is a moral order in the universe just as real and just as exact as the physical order. Every act has its consequences; morals as well as motors operate by law. God is not capricious, fickle, or erratic. He does not pass judgment on the basis of whim or fancy. But rather God is equable and dependable, dealing with men through law and with justice, though tempered by mercy. St. Paul recognized this basic truth when he said: "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for 670 whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting" (Galatians 6:7-8.) And this is an immutable law of life, for rewards and punishments must inevitably follow the actions of men as the natural consequences of these actions. Each person works out his own salvation on the solid basis of retribution and compensation. Judgment is largely self-operative. But there are some, many perhaps, who seek to deceive God and man in the hope of getting by and avoiding natural consequences. Man they may deceive, but God never. It is partly because man is so easily deceived by man that some escape with so little suffering in this life, and others are required to endure so much. If mortal life were all there were, then justice would be cheated; but, fortunately, there is an eternity, and the inequalities of the present will some day be ironed out with justice for all. No amount of camouflage will be sufficient in getting one by. God is not mocked. The veneer of conformity, the shell of righteousness, behind which so many hide today, will be of little use when the searchlight of eternity exposes the souls of men as they really ate. And this is at it should be, for it places the responsibility for acts upon the shoulders of those who perform them. It is man's duty to carry this responsibility well, and though he may be called upon to sacrifice and suffer more than his share at times, he can be assured that, in the long tun, things will balance out and he will not be shortchanged. Persons Versus Principles Sometimes it proves very difficult to decide whether one's allegiance should be to a person or to a principle. Since man is a "social being" he has responsibility to his fellow men as well as to himself. But his first duty is toward right and truth as he sees it, and if, by the abuse of authority or in some other way, it becomes necessary for him as a free agent to choose between right and friendship or right and obedience, let him choose the right; let him favor the principle rather than the person. There is a vast difference between real leadership and mere headship. The one springs from righteousness and ability exercised in a responsible manner, while the other depends only on position. The irresponsible use of position for personal advantage or vanity is an abuse of freedom and a perversion of the moral law. Authority to be used righteously must be applied modestly and responsibly. Here is what the Lord said on this point: We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. Hence many are called, but few are chosen. No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile? Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy (Doc. And Cov. 121:39-43). LESSON DEPARTMENT Authority should seldom be used in an arbitrary or dictatorial manner. Both democracy and Christianity cry out against such abuse. Necessity may require a little of the "ordering and forbidding" technique in controlling young children or other immature persons, but when used it should be done sparingly, with love, and only 'as a stopgap or temporary device until self-control is learned. As soon as possible every individual should be made to feel responsible, and outside control should be abandoned in favor of self-control. Discipline is frequently necessary; but the sooner it is transformed into self-discipline the better, for in this way only are freedom, responsibility, and the good life possible. Through free choice man becomes a moral agent responsible for his own acts and capable of reaching upward. Moral Courage But it takes real courage to climb upward in the face of obstacles. It would be easier to follow the line of least resistance, to ignore the future, to dodge responsibility, to blame the devil, et cetera. This, however, is not the way of righteousness nor happiness. The lowest order of action is inactivity, laziness; the next is blind action, ignorance; the next is conforming action, obedience; the next is creative action, initiative; and finally, the last and highest is responsible action, progression. Responsible initiative is made possible by the free agency with which man is endowed, and it is only through using this that man is able to reach forever upward. There is too much whimpering and dodging today; too much 671 cowardice in the field of morals; too little courage. If a thing is right it is our duty to abide by it, regardless of the friends we may lose or the immediate inconveniences we may encounter. Life is eternal, and there is a moral law in nature that provides just compensation for all actions, either now or later. The roads ahead are ours-and we are free to choose which way we will go. But we are responsible for the way we go and in this responsibility lies the basis for moral living. May we live for eternity, not just for today, with vision and courage for what lies ahead. Problems for Thought and Action 1, What does it mean to say that man has free agency? How did he get it? Defend the case of free agency against the philosophy of fatalism which opposes it. How can man be foreordained but not predestined? If special reports on these subjects were assigned a month ago have them given now and discuss the points of view offered. Why does free agency make moral responsibility imperative? Why is the attempt to dodge responsibility immoral? Name and discuss some of the ways people try to dodge responsibility. To what extent should we blame the devil for our weaknesses and mistakes? Discuss. Why does every right carry with it a responsibility? Why may free agency be either an opportunity or a liability? 2. What is the moral law of the universe? What do we mean when we say that judgment is largely self-operative? Are personal consequences involved in every personal act? Are the full consequences of every act realized in this mortal life? Discuss. 3. Why is loyalty to a principle more important than loyalty to a person? What is the difference between leadership and headship? Why is it immoral to be irresponsible in the use of position or authority? Give examples of this and discuss the reference from the Doctrine 672 and Covenants cited in the lesson. Is the arbitrary and dictatorial use of authority ever justified? Discuss, Why is self-control important in the moral life? 4. What is moral courage and why is it important? What are the levels of human action? Why would responsible creative action be impossible without free agency? Why is it necessary for the greatest happiness and the greatest good? What does it mean to live each day for eternity and why is this important? 5. Study the following poem by William C. Clegg and point out its application to the lesson: Know this, that every soul is free, To choose his life and what he'll be; For this eternal truth is given, That God will force no man to heaven. He'll call, persuade, direct aright, And bless with wisdom, love and light; In countless ways be good and kind But never force the human mind. Bring to class a copy of William Ernest Henley's poem "Invictus" and show its relevance to the discussion. If time permits look up and use other poems, scriptures, and quotations on the subject.

GOD'S GARDEN Daphne Jemmett Down in a rocky canyon Close by the Blackfoot River, Deep in the heart of the mountains, Is the strangest garden ever. Roses huge, and cabbages Lying side by side, Hewn from out the solid rock, And strewn on the wild hillside. I wonder if some giant Playing with rock-like clay Fashioned the roses and cabbages And then threw them away; Or did God make a garden there And then just let it stay, A monument to gardening?
