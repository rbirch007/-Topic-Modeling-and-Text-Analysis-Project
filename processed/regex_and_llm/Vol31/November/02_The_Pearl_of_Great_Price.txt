The Pearl of Great Price Elder Joseph Fielding Smith Member of the Council of the Twelve THE Pearl of Great Price is the Here is the title of a small volume which has been accepted by the Church as one of the standard works. It is a compilation of "revelations, translations, and narrations," taken from the history and inspired writings of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The first edition was published in Liverpool by Franklin D. Richards, who was then presiding in the European Mission, in the year 1851. The first edition contained a number of excerpts and revelations which were later eliminated because they appear in the Doctrine and Covenants. These are: "A key to the revelation of John," section 77 in the Doctrine and Covenants; the prophecy on war, section 87, Doctrine and Covenants; passages from sections 20, 107, 27; and the hymn by Elder John Jacques—"O Say, What Is Truth?" In this compilation the prophecy on war, which was given Christmas Day, 1832, was published for the first time, and it will be seen this was ten years before the rebellion of South Carolina.
The recent editions of the Pearl of Great Price have been divided into the following divisions: (1) The Book of Moses, which is a portion of the revision made by the Prophet Joseph Smith of the Bible, commencing with the "Visions of Moses," containing the words which the Lord "spake... at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain." (2) The Book of Abraham. (3) Writings of Joseph Smith, containing "an Extract from a Translation of the Bible, Being the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, commencing with the last verse of the twenty-third chapter, King James' Version," and excerpts from the history of Joseph Smith, and" (4) The Articles of Faith.
The revision of the Bible by revelation commenced shortly after the organization of the Church and when Sidney Rigdon came into the Church he was called to act as scribe for the Prophet. The additional scripture which we have received in these few pages, which comprise about as much as does the Book of Mark, is of the greatest value to the Church because of the additional light which is revealed concerning the history and doctrine of those early times before the flood, making known the fact that the fulness of the gospel was given to Adam and his posterity. In this record many of the precious truths which were taken away have been restored.
The Book of Abraham is a translation of a record kept by Abraham which came into the hands of the Prophet Joseph Smith in a miraculous manner while he was residing in Kirtland, Ohio. The papyrus on which this record was written came from the catacombs of Egypt and was purchased by the saints. The detailed account of how this happened will not relate, for it has been published several times and can be found in the History of the 612 Church, Vol. 2, pages 235, 236, 348, 349 and 350. It is also given in the M.I.A. Course of Study, Adult Department for the year 1938-39. The Church has accepted the writings of Moses and the writings of Abraham as revelations to Joseph Smith, as glorious additions to the doctrines of the Church. It is becoming a popular teaching that Moses did not write the Book of Genesis, but that it is a compilation of several authors giving different accounts of the matters which this Book contains. It is interesting to the Latter-day Saints to read the words of the Lord to Moses in relation to the teachings of our times, which he received by prophecy. To him the Lord said: And, now, Moses, my son, I will speak unto thee concerning this earth upon which thou standest; and thou shalt write the things which I shall speak. And in a day when the children of men shall esteem my words as naught and take many of them from the book which thou shalt write, behold, I will raise up another like unto thee; and they shall be had again among the children of men—among as many as shall believe. That one who was to be raised up is the Prophet Joseph Smith, and we should be humbly grateful that the Lord has fulfilled his words to Moses, through the Prophet of the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times.
