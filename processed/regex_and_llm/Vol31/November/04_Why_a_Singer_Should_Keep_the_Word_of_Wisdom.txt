Why A Singer Should Keep the Word of Wisdom Emma Lucy Gates Bowen ' E who were children fifty years ago kept the Word of Wisdom because our parents taught us that it had been revealed by the Lord to Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Then, later, many of us who went to Europe to study and travel learned its importance through experience. When I was on the boat making my first trip across the Atlantic Ocean I was very seasick, and was confined to my stateroom for several days. I was on a small steamer that took ten days to cross the ocean, and the boat pitched and rolled considerably. When I reached the deck, I was white from nausea and weak from lack of food. I was an object of pity to my fellow passengers, and the word of my illness soon reached the ears of the ship's doctor. In due time, the deck boy came along with a glass of sparkling yellow liquid and offered it to me. I gave one look at it and said, "Take your beer away, Tannie; I want none of it." "Beer!" he said very disgustedly, "this is not beer, but champagne, - the finest thing we have on the boat. The doctor says you must take it!" So I drank it; and while it settled my stomach, its other affects were anything but desirable. That was my introduction to the wines of Europe. Although I tasted other kinds while there, the occasions were rare; I realized I could not make a practice of using them. I had read enough to know that all wines and liquors are drying to the throat as well as exhilarating to the' heart, and that when one is standing before the public to sing in opera, they make him more nervous than he is already. Had I not already been convinced by the teachings of my childhood and the reading of my young womanhood, I would have been won over to the ill effects of using liquor by the advice of my colleagues when I reached the opera house where I made my debut, for they said, "I see you are not taking anything to drink before going on the stage, Miss Gates." I answered that I never had, and that I did not believe in doing so. Then they urged, "Never begin it, for if you do, you will regret it." I remember the second time I had liquor offered me. It was after I had been in Germany about eight months. I had the great privilege of going to the graduating banquet with Dr. John A. Widtsoe, my brother-in-law, who was receiving his doctor's degree from Gottingen, one of Europe's greatest universities. It was an elegant affair, and with the first course red wine was offered. I said, "No, thank you." The young man on my left said, "Oh, perhaps you prefer white wine?" Again I said, "No, thank you." Then he urged, "Let me get you some beer." Again I said, "I don't drink that either." "Oh," he said, "You are Page 613 614 a teetotaler." "Yes," I answered, much relieved. "Then let me get you a cup of coffee or tea," he graciously offered. When I replied again, "I don't drink them either," he glared at me and said, "What do you drink?" "Water," I answered. "Water!" he yelled. "Why water is for washing, not for drinking." And with quite a bit of trouble and fanfare I finally got a glass of water. AS to smoking. I have never had the least desire to even try it. In Germany I never saw a woman smoke, and at the opera house many of the men did not smoke, and those who did always refrained from so doing during the day when they were to sing at night. In my opinion, smoking is especially bad for women. When young girls or women come to me to learn to sing, I can always tell if they are coffee drinkers or cigarette smokers. If they drink excessively of coffee, they are nervous and cannot concentrate. If they are smokers, their voices are husky and even hoarse. I wait for a few lessons to be sure their indisposition is not from a cold (to which they usually attribute it), and then I say, "Do you smoke by any chance?" And if they say, "Yes," I then tell them they must choose between smoking and singing, because the two just don't go together—for women at least.. Smoking makes the voice dry and with an edge, as well as making it hard to produce clear tones. Some students have given up smoking; others have been unable to do so and have dropped out of the singing race. I understand that once one has acquired the habit, it is almost impossible to overcome it. I remember hearing our beautiful and gracious Mrs. Smoot, wife of our Senator and Apostle Reed Smoot, tell about a luncheon given in the White House in Washington, D. C., especially in her honor. She and the President's wife, Mrs. Hoover, were the only two women at the table who were not smoking. The lady on her left said, "I see you don't smoke, Mrs. Smoot." Mrs. Smoot answered, "No, I never have." "Don't ever begin. I wish I had never acquired the habit," said the lady. I also remember my Aunt Nettie Easton telling me that someone (I think it was her father, Brigham Young) said to her, "Daughter, if you never drink tea and coffee you will never have wrinkles in your face." Now, of course, we know of many dear old ladies who have kept the word of wisdom faithfully and yet they have some wrinkles; and some persons who have observed the word of wisdom have died young, nevertheless, that does not alter the fact that our Latter-day Saint women who have observed the Word of Wisdom have, as a rule, looked fresher and lived longer than those of the world who indulge in stimulants. How hard and dried up the skin of the face of a modern young smoking woman looks. You can tell the smoker almost every time. My Aunt Nett lived to be over eighty years of age and kept her beautiful complexion, her wit, and sprightly step until the last. I remember that all the years that she worked in the office of the Genealogical Society she did not use eyeglasses even when searching through record books or newspapers, which was her special task. I recall that one day when she and one of her friends, who was WHY A SINGER SHOULD KEEP THE WORD OF WISDOM twenty years her junior, were walking down town in New York City on a hot July day, the friend turned to Aunt Nett and said, "How old did you say you were, Nett?" And Nett replied, "Seventy-eight." The friend then said, "I wish to heaven you were 104, because you are walking me to death." Now, I feel sure, that my keeping of the word of wisdom contributed in large measure to my success in my musical career, and that it is responsible for my well-being at the present time. And if I had not grown so fat with eating too much good food (which, in a way, is breaking the part of the word of wisdom which indicates that we should use things in moderation), I know I would be  as well and as active as I was at forty. I am now sixty-three years old (telling my age for the benefit of those who saw my picture in TheJuly 1943, p. 367, among those of the wives of the Church authorities. This picture was taken when the public knew me best, and was chosen by your editor—not by me). I hope to keep the word of wisdom more fully and to lose some of my weight, so I can live some years yet to enjoy my loved ones, God's beautiful mountains and valleys here in Utah, and to do more good than I have done in the past. Now, let me tell one more experience of mine. The reader must forgive my talking so much about myself, but I was asked to give some of my experiences in life related to the word of wisdom, and not to give a dissertation on the subject nor talk of its value from a dietetic standpoint. Some years ago, I was asked to visit 615 Glendale and be soloist with the Los Angeles orchestra which was giving a concert there. I am sure Professor Altschuller, the conductor, expected to hear a worn-out prima donna, because so many of my confreres or singers of that time had left the stage and their voices showed great wear and tear, and he was not enthusiastic about having me. Well, we started out on the "mad scene" from the opera Lucia by Donizetti, and I sailed right through it in the original key, going up to high E flat above high C with ease in the cadenza with the flute. When I finished, he put his conductor's stick down on the stand and turned to me; and before those eighty men and women of the orchestra he said, "Let me see, Miss Gates, it must be fifteen years since I heard you, is it not?" I answered, "Yes, I think it is, Mr. Altschuller." "Well," he said, "your voice is as lovely as ever. In fact it sounds like that of a girl of twenty. Will you tell me how you do it?" I was taken aback a bit I can tell you. Then the answer came to me, and I said, “Herr Conductor, I have never dissipated (by that I had in mind drinking, smoking, and loose living) "and I know how to sing." "I'll tell the world you do," he said. "Proceed, gentlemen, with the next aria" (which was the Lakme Bell song). Now I want to leave my testimony with you. Correct living, according to the word of God to Joseph Smith and the men who have followed him. And according to the word of those whom he has inspired with the new truths of science and nutrition, pays dividends. When we break the rules of health or of the spirit we have to pay to the utmost farthing.
