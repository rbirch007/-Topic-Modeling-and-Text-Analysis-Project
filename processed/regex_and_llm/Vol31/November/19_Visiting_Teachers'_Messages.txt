Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength? The Beatitudes Lesson 5?Blessed Are the Merciful Elder Bryant S. Hinckley For Tuesday, February 6, 1945 "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (Matthew 5:7; III Nephi, 12:7). Objective: To show that mercy, essential to God's plan, is an ennobling quality important in our relationships with our fellow men. O be merciful is to have a heart made warm with the sunshine of kindness. If we are merciful, we search for the best in our fellows, instead of the worst; we seek extenuating circumstances, rather than incriminating ones; we are slow to condemn, and quick to commend. Mercy is a spontaneous expression of a loving heart. If we are merciful, we naturally think and say the best possible of our erring brother. When justice is meted out, we all plead for it to be tempered with mercy. Alma in speaking to his son Corianton expounded the doctrine of justice and mercy. (See Alma 42) The divine injunction to be merciful is magnificently expounded in Shakespeare's portrayal of the 664 character of Shylock in the Merchant of Venice?when Shylock demands his pound of flesh because the bond prescribes that he may do so. Then it is that Shakespeare puts into the mouth of the noble Portia these eloquent words: The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice bless'd; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. "Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes The throned monarch better than _ his crown; His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God's, When mercy seasons justice. (Merchant of Venice, Act 4, Scene I) The way to obtain mercy is to exercise it toward others. Let us be -assured that any man or woman who cherishes resentments and grudges, and who is intolerant toward others, is closing the door that opens the way to his own forgiveness, for in the final analysis the feelings that are in our own souls, the emotions that play upon our hearts determine whether or not we shall be the recipients of the mercy of God, and upon this rests our own forgiveness and our exaltation.

Driggs For Tuesday, February 20, 1945 LIKE four fine voices singing in harmony, the four writers of the Gospels blend in their portrayal of the life and the message of the Savior. Each of them has his own individual approach and style in dealing with varied phases of the sacred theme; yet all are in unison, Matthew, for example, seems to take special interest in the sermons and sayings of the Master; Mark seems to have found joy in preserving significant incidents in the life of Jesus; Luke, as said in a previous lesson, was concerned primarily with writing the events and the words of the Master in sequence?as living history; John devoted himself more - It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 36-38. LESSON DEPARTMENT to interpreting the spiritual life and the divine message of the Savior. It is only natural that from the "beloved disciple" we should get this more intimate portrayal. Of all those privileged to enjoy the friendship and confidence of the Master, none seemed to be held closer than John. He was a part of the family circle. Even on the cross the Savior committed to this devoted follower the care of his own mother; and from that time Mary lived in the home of John. The affection of the Savior for this disciple is brought to us with occasional delicate touches in the Gospel of St. John. Every chapter of this uplifting record also brings one nearer to the inner meaning of the gospel as it was taught and lived by the Son of God. Its opening lines give the keynote, and the central theme of the remarkable book? In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not (John 1:1-5). Throughout this Gospel it is the truth that Jesus Christ was the veritable Son of God, one with the Father from the beginning?that is constantly impressed in word and deeds. Recognition of this divine truth is given at the outset by John the Baptist, who first announced himself as "the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord." And later, when Jesus appears, he says, "Behold the 665 Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" Following this incident, with swift strokes, John tells in his Gospel of the calling of the apostles, of the recognition by Peter and Nathanael of the Messiah. He depicts the first miracle?that of changing the water into wine, then he tells of the cleansing of the temple by the Savior, who with righteous indignation says to the money changers, "Take these things hence; make not my Fathers house an house of merchandise." After this comes another incident which adds emphasis to the fact that Jesus was indeed the Christ. Nicodemus, a Pharisee and a ruler of the Jews, comes in the night seeking wisdom from Jesus, and says, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him." And Jesus, instructing this leader, tells him among other things, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." (John 3: 16). Another incident related by John is that of the "Woman at the Well." To this woman, one of the Samaritans, a mixed race despised by the Jews, Jesus not only gives spiritual counsel, but tells her that he is the long-looked-for Messiah. Throughout the Gospel of Saint John, this truth is impressed and reimpressed. Moreover, the divinity of the work of the Savior is brought forth in many oft-quoted lines. The emphasis in this Gospel is on the spiritual, the inner meaning of the message Christ brought to the 666 world. Following are some sayings to illustrate the point: Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:5). The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise (John 5:19). I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me (John 5:30). If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself (John 7:17). Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me (John 7:33)- Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also (John 8:19). And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (John 8:32). It is truths such as these, presented simply and impressively, that bring one closer to the inner meaning of the gospel. From a literary viewpoint, the Gospel of St. John is less Hebraic and more Grecian in form. Matthew, for example, has the basic characteristics of Hebrew wisdom literature, presenting the teachings of Christ in proverb-like sentences. With John there is more continuity, discussion of the principles presented. The Master is portrayed as an interpreter of the truths he would give to the world. He reasons with those who seek to understand. He meets the Pharisees on their own ground, anticipates and answers their questions, aimed at trapping him with his own words. And during these discussions, he frequently voices gems of truth. Following are a few of these precious sayings: While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light (John 12:36). For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always (John 12:8). My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me (John 7:16). Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me (John 5:39). I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live (John 11:25). Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you (John 14:27). If ye love me, keep my commandments (John 14:15) Our indebtedness to John is great. He has preserved for us many priceless sayings of the Savior. A closer view is given us by this "beloved disciple" of Jesus presenting principles of the gospel. Added to this we have in the Gospel of St. John a number of incidents in the life of the Master not recorded in the other Gospels?stories that enrich and illuminate his life and work. Dr. Dinsmore says of this author: He (John) was persuaded that Jesus, the Christ, was the Son of God, the Eternal Word.... The Eternal Light shines in the world's darkness?it divides men into the children of light and of darkness; the many love the darkness, but those who receive the light become the Sons of God..... This book has no analogue either in ancient or in modern times. A drama, cosmic in its range, written by a Hebrew in the Greek manner, of lucid profundity, the most disturbing, the most comforting of all books, filled with sadness, filled with hope, love pervading it as an atmosphere, LESSON DEPARTMENT 667 It is the Church's Most precious Spiritual document. To feel the uplift, the strength, the literary artistry of the gospel literature given to us by the ''beloved disciple," one must read and reread it with receptive mind and heart. John caught the divine import of the life and work of our Savior; and he portrayed the Son of God living and teaching truth? expounding through word and deed the way of salvation for all mankind. With artistic touches, with devotion to the sacred theme, he has bequeathed to the world a drama of divine love. 1, (a) Point out briefly individual in-terests or characteristics of each of the four authors of the Gospels.
