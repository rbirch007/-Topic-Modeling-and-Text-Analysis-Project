ALL THESE REMAIN Betty Wall Madsen We still have these, within a troubled land: The warm simplicity of children's trust, The friendship held in someone's outstretched hand, And love that lives when everything is dust.

All of the other Baltic provinces, including Poland, took the same course between the months of November 1917 and February 1918. BUT the type of government in Finland was not decided without civil war and bloodshed. The Russian Soviet quickly recognized the independence of Finland, but it was soon supporting a Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic which seized power in Helsinki at the end of January 1918. General Mannerheim, a Swedo-Finn, and formerly of the Russian Imperial Army and then (1918) an intense foe of Bolshevism, organized a White Guard and established his headquarters at Vaasa (modern Nicholaistad) on the Gulf of Bothnia. Within a few months, Mannerheim, ably assisted by a German contingent under General von Goltz, occupied Helsinki and the entire country along the Gulf of Finland. The last Red stronghold at Viipuri (modern Viborg) capitulated on May 16, 1918. But the price the Finns were to pay for German intervention was soon made evident through the infamous Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, by which the Soviet Union withdrew from the war. By terms of this treaty, Russia relinquished her claims to Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Courland, Livonia, Lithuania, Bessarabia and the Aaland Islands, and ceded Russian Armenia to Turkey. However, the freeing of these states by Russia carried with it the obligation to recognize any program of Germanization that Germany might attempt, and the Reich was determined to establish a series of protectorates in this immense Baltic area. As a result, Finland was at once reduced to the status of a mere military and economic outpost and dependent of Berlin under the leadership of one, Prince Frederick Karl of Hesse, who was named King of Finland. These developments were fortunately terminated by the armistice which ended World War I in 1918. With the forced withdrawal of German troops and the temporary assumption of the Regency by General Mannerheim, the Finns proclaimed their country a republic, and, in July 1919, elected Professor Stahlberg as its first president.
Though relieved by the Treaty of Paris (1919) from respecting the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918), and though victorious in war with several border states, within which she hoped to establish friendly Bolshevik governments, the Soviet Union persevered in the policy of recognizing the independence of the nationalities formerly subject to her. Thus, by a series of treaties signed in 1920, she recognized the independence of Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia (comprising the Letts of Livonia and Courland), and Lithuania. In July 1921, Russia and Finland signed a neutrality pact and, in 1925, an arbitration treaty. The Treaty of Dorpat (October 1920), defined the Russo-Finnish frontier. By this treaty, Finland renounced her claims 640 to East Karelia, while Russia surrendered her claims to Petsamo, which thereupon became Finland's only ice-free port on the Arctic Sea. The long quarrel with Sweden over the Aaland Islands was referred to the Council of the League of Nations. This body on June 24, 1921, recognized the claim of Finland to the islands but insisted that they remain unfortified. This decision led to the calling of a regional conference on Baltic problems in October 1921. The result was a multilateral treaty, signed April 6, 1922, by Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Germany, Poland, Great Britain, France and Italy, guaranteeing the neutrality and international protection of the Aaland Islands. In 1921, Finland appealed to the League of Nations in behalf of the Finnish population of eastern Karelia. The Finns claimed that the Russians were not allowing the Karelian Finns the right of self government as they had promised to do by the Treaty of Dorpat (1920). However, neither the League Council nor the Permanent Court of International Justice to which the problem was finally referred, did anything to satiate the Finns, because each organization hesitated to challenge the Soviet Republic. The situation continued unchanged, and it proved to be one of the roots of the present Russo-Finnish War, for the Finns are fighting today to annex Karelia. Beginning with the Litvinov Pact (1929), in which Russia, Poland, Latvia, Rumania, Lithuania, Turkey, and Persia agreed to patch up their border differences, Russia entered into similar conventions with Finland, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Mongolia. IN the fall of 1939, Russia took full advantage of Germany's preoccupation in the west to strengthen her own strategic positions, ostensibly for the purpose of acquiring better frontiers for future defense against Germany. Thus in September 1939, the Russians and Germans partitioned hapless Poland; and, on September 29, October 5, and October 10, respectively, the Soviet Government, through treaties with the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, acquired the right to establish military, naval and air bases in their territories, and thus reduced the three states to strategic vassalage. But the republic of Finland did not meet the Soviet overtures with the same complacency. The Russians demanded of Finland territorial concessions on the Karelian Isthmus for the better security of Leningrad, territorial concessions in the Petsamo area for the defense of Murmansk; and a naval base at Hango. When the Finns refused, Russia, ignoring her Russo-Finnish Non-aggression Pact, began her attack on the Republic, November 30, 1939. The next day (December 1st), she set up a puppet government at Teryoki. Thus began the second Russo-Finnish War. The Finns appealed to the League of Nations and, on December 14. That body declared Russia the aggressor, and expelled her from the organization. In the United States widespread sympathy was expressed for Finland's cause. Credit for nonmilitary supplies was extended through the U. S. Export and Import Bank, and the American people gave FINLAND generously for Finnish relief. Great Britain and France supplied some military equipment and a number of Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes volunteered for service in the Finnish army. However, none of the Scandinavian governments was willing to participate in the war, for fear of Nazi retaliation. For this reason, Norway and Sweden refused a formal request: from Great Britain and France (March 2, 1940) for the right to use their territories for the transportation of war, supplies to Finland. To have granted such a request would have courted almost certain invasion by Germany, who obviously could not tolerate the establishment of Allied bases on her northern flank. Thus, by a peculiar combination of circumstances, "the Allies were saved from going to war with Russia, but the embittered Finns were saved to become allies of the Nazis." (Haynes and Hoffman The Origins and Background of the Second World War, p. 561). Although fighting brilliantly, the Finns, deprived of Allied support, were forced to come to terms. By the Treaty of Moscow (March 12, 1940), Finland was compelled to cede to Russia the whole of the Karelian Isthmus; the important port of Viipuri (modern Viborg); several islands in the Gulf of Finland; the territory north and west of Lake Ladoga; a tract of land near Salla; and a small area about Petsamo. She also granted the Russians a thirty-year lease of the port of Hango. The Soviet Government at once organized the new Karelian acquisition as the "Karelian-Finnish Socialist Federative Soviet Republic." In the summer of 1941, Finland, still resentful toward the Soviet 641 Union because of its untoward attack, joined with Hitler in a secret military alliance. Then, when the Germans determined upon an invasion of Russia (June 22, 1941), the Finns resumed their "Russo-Finnish War" and supported actively the German invasion. However, the Finns declare that in this renewed war they were not the aggressors but that their active participation resulted only after the Russians had first attacked. This point of view is represented in a very lucid article which appeared recently in a reputable British publication, the Nineteenth Century. Part of the article is worth repeating here. It follows: "Finland did not take advantage of the occasion offered by the German attack on Russia in June 1941, to avenge the defeat she suffered at the hands of the Red Army in the previous year and to recover her lost territories. Finland was not the aggressor?she was, for the second time, the victim of aggression. When Russia was herself invaded on June 22, 1941, she at once resumed her active hostility to Finland," and this despite the fact that the Soviet Government had expressed satisfaction with the treaty of March 12, 1940. "On that same day," continues the commentator, "the Russians bombed the Aaland Islands and attempted to bomb two Finnish warships. On the 23rd, Abo (modern Turku), was bombed by twenty-four Russian airplanes. The open city of Villmanstrand was bombed on the same day?so was the Malm airdrome near Helsinki. By the 26th, more than ten Finnish towns had been bombed. By the Russians and suffered heavy casualties. On that day, the President, Risto Ryti. 642 broadcasted a declaration that Finland would fight. 'They decided to fight in self-defense for a second time. But they limited their military operations to the recovery of the districts that had been wrested from them in the previous year. They did not take part in the offensive against Leningrad?they deny that their guns have bombarded that Russian port." But, regardless of which country was the aggressor, the point is that Finland today, as an active ally of Germany against Russia, finds herself in a most precarious and unfortunate position. In spite of the justice of her cause, it is difficult to discern just how her cause can be aided by the Allies at the forthcoming peace conference, for it should be clear that the Allies will be forced to co-operate with the Soviet Union and recognize its demands for territorial security, and this, of course, will involve the fate of Finland. In the opinion of the writer, under these untoward circumstances, the Finns will be fortunate to escape with a settlement based on the provisions of the Moscow Treaty of 1940. This much is certain, the best immediate guarantee for continued independence of the Republic will be the establishment of friendly relations between the Finns and the Russians. ? Lula Greene Richards HE long and active earth life of one of the Church's interesting and gifted women was brought to a close Friday, September 8, 1944, when Louisa Lula Greene Richards passed away at her home in Salt Lake City at the age of ninety-five. Since her girlhood, the literary compositions of Sister Richards have delighted and inspired the women of the Church and won for her an enduring place in their hearts. In her early twenties her writing ability so attracted Church leaders that she was called to be first editor of the Woman's Exponent, forerunner of Theand the first publication owned and printed by Latter-day Saint women. Sister Richards creditably fulfilled the exacting requirements of this position, serving from June 1, 1872 to July 15, 1877, when family responsibilities made it necessary for her to relinquish her editorial work after having set standards and established patterns many of which were followed throughout the life of the publication. Sister Richards was dainty in appearance, refined in manner, and a devoted Latter-day Saint. Throughout her life she was active in Church auxiliary work, For many years she was a member of the Primary General Board. She was also an active temple worker. Sister Richards found joy and comfort in her testimony of the divinity of Christ and the sure knowledge of the resurrection. The Relief Society General Board acknowledges with gratitude the contributions of Lula Greene Richards to the Relief Society.
