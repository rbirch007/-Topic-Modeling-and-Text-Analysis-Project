THANKFUL THOUGHTS Gertrude Perry Stanton November is not bleak and drear Though trees are gaunt and winds are chill; Around the hearth is warmth and cheer, When ice-bound is each lake and rill. The books that one has longed to read, The friends who come to chat, will bring To these gray, shortened days their meed Of joy bright as spring's blossoming. And when has come that day of days While dear ones gather in the home To feast, and render grateful praise For good things past and still to come, We thank thee, God, for all thy gifts, Cherished in wintry days like these; True friendships held from year to year, And Oh, thank him for families!
