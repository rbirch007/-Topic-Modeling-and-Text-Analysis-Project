Social Science Modern Applications of Ethical Principles Lesson 4?Freedom and Responsibility Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, February 27, 1945  Lesson Link, One month ago we took a mental an verbal survey of the road to righteousness. "It thinking and talking about it. Action and achievement beyond the ordinary, initiative, effort, accomplishment, these are the things that form the background to the moral life. Righteousness is a process; and he is best who keeps moving and who moves the farthest in the upward direction. Lesson aim. To show that freedom an that consequences follow acts; and that individuals are, therefore, morally responsible for their acts. IF the world is to be made any better or any happier than itis now, it will only be through some great moral reawakening. As long as large numbers of people live blindly, lazily, and selfishly, with little thought for tomorrow and little concern over improvement, humanity will continue to flounder in darkness and despair. As we have seen, it is only through intelligent creative effort that righteousness and supreme happiness are made possible. Creative activity springs from the free agency of man, but even it may become dissipated and perverted unless tempered and controlled by the spirit of responsibility. It is through the effort born of freedom and nurtured on responsibility that the greatest good is brought about and the greatest joy realized. Uses and Abuses of Freedom Man is a free agent capable of weighing alternatives, making decisions, and acting according to his choice. The question of whether man should be free in this way or should be compelled in all things was decided a long time ago in the council in heaven (Moses 4:1-4). And the decision there was a wise one, for out of free agency comes the opportunity for growth and righteous living. There are some who believe that man is not free in the way that we have explained here, but a little thought should dispel any doubt on this point. Some claim that since everything has a cause man is forced to act in the way he does act by the multiplicity of causes which have gone before. Man is not responsible for his thoughts and actions, they say, for both thoughts and actions are predetermined by all that precedes them. But no! This cannot be, for while it is true that everything has a cause, yet there must have been a first cause uncontrolled by precedents. Man is more than a piece of clay molded by circumstances, more than a puppet manipulated by fate. Man is a free agent, influenced by circumstances to be sure, but capable of rising above them. There is a spontaneity, a creative urge, a free agency (call it what you will) within the soul of every man that permits him to decide where he will go, and which makes him master of his own fate. If this were not so there would be little need to talk about morality and ethics, for regardless of the state of man's progress or happiness he could do nothing about it. He would be predestined to the fate before him and in the whirl of circumstances he would stand helpless. But ?fortunately such is not the case. Man does have the power to choose freely, and thereby to lift himself above the forces that would pull him down. Man is a creator; like God potentially. These fatalistic and deterministic  LESSON DEPARTMENT philosophies which picture man as a mere cog in a machine, devoid of free choice and free action, make the concept of ethics impossible and those of right and wrong ridiculous. Morality is based upon a scheme of free agency which lets man choose, but makes him responsible for the way he chooses. Though he may be foreordained, man is never predestined; though influenced by circumstances, man is never controlled entirely by them. The final choice is always up to the individual, freed of all compulsion, and that, of course, is why the individual is always responsible. Freedom, then, is a fact that makes moral responsibility imperative. But there is a tendency, widespread among us, to seek the privileges that freedom affords without accepting the responsibilities involved. It should be realized that freedom and responsibility are inseparably connected. It is impossible to have one without the other, and to try to do so is immoral. But people do try to dodge responsibility, and here are some of the ways: (1) They misinterpret freedom to mean the absence of all restraint and then, in their attempt to have it, they oppose all discipline and control from the outside. This is a distortion of the very meaning of freedom, for it selfishly sidesteps responsibility to others. Carried to its logical end it would mean anarchy and nihilism. Social restraints, whether imposed by parents, governments, or other agencies, are for the good of the individual as well as the group, and those who seek to throw them off often end up at the bottom of the hill. Freedom from the power and pull of evil is the final 669 goal to be sought and it can never be reached by indulgence. (2) They consider themselves to be victims of circumstances and in the spirit of self-justification and self-pity they throw off responsibility by offering excuses and blaming others. This is wrong, for it fails to recognize that, in the final analysis, it is the individual that chooses and is responsible. (3) They sometimes blame the devil for their weaknesses and immoral acts, failing to realize that, while the devil can lead, it is only they who can decide to follow. All in all, it can be said that if the intrinsic relationship between freedom and responsibility were more thoroughly understood, the world would be a better place in which to live. There are obligations involved in every privilege we accept, whether we like it ornot. The free agency with which we are endowed may be either an opportunity or a liability depending on how responsible we are in the use of it. Actually, there are no rights without responsibilities, and those who try to live as if there were will find themselves held doubly responsible when the final score is added up. A Moral Law For the Universe There is a moral order in the universe just as real and just as exact as the physical order. Every act has its consequences; morals as well as motors operate by law. God is not capricious, fickle, or erratic. He does not pass judgment on the basis of whim or fancy. But rather God is equable and dependable, dealing with men through law and with justice, though tempered by mercy. St. Paul recognized this basic truth when he said: "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for 670 whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting" (Galatians 6:7-8.) And this is an immutable law of life, for rewards and punishments must inevitably follow the actions of men as the natural consequences of these actions. Each person works out his own salvation on the solid basis of retribution and compensation. Judgment is largely self-operative. But there are some, many perhaps, who seek to deceive God and man in the hope of getting by and avoiding natural consequences. Man they may deceive, but God never. It is partly because man is so easily deceived by man that some escape with so little suffering in this life, and others are required to endure so much. If mortal life were all there were, then justice would be cheated; but, fortunately, there is an eternity, and the inequalities of the present will some day be ironed out with justice for all. No amount of camouflage will be sufficient in getting one by. God is not mocked. The veneer of conformity, the shell of righteousness, behind which so many hide today, will be of little use when the searchlight of eternity exposes the souls of men as they really ate. And this is at it should be, for it places the responsibility for acts upon the shoulders of those who perform them. It is man's duty to carry this responsibility well, and though he may be called upon to sacrifice and suffer more than his share at times, he can be assured that, in the long tun, things will balance out and he will not be shortchanged. Persons Versus Principles Sometimes it proves very difficult to decide whether one's allegiance should be to a person or to a principle. Since man is a "social being" he has responsibility to his fellow men as well as to himself. But his first duty is toward right and truth as he sees it, and if, by the abuse of authority or in some other way, it becomes necessary for him as a free agent to choose between right and friendship or right and obedience, let him choose the right; let him favor the principle rather than the person. There is a vast difference between real leadership and mere headship. The one springs from righteousness and ability exercised in a responsible manner, while the other depends only on position. The irresponsible use of position for personal advantage or vanity is an abuse of freedom and a perversion of the moral law. Authority to be used righteously must be applied modestly and responsibly. Here is what the Lord said on this point: We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. Hence many are called, but few are chosen. No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile? Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy (Doc. And Cov. 121:39-43). LESSON DEPARTMENT Authority should seldom be used in an arbitrary or dictatorial manner. Both democracy and Christianity cry out against such abuse. Necessity may require a little of the "ordering and forbidding" technique in controlling young children or other immature persons, but when used it should be done sparingly, with love, and only 'as a stopgap or temporary device until self-control is learned. As soon as possible every individual should be made to feel responsible, and outside control should be abandoned in favor of self-control. Discipline is frequently necessary; but the sooner it is transformed into self-discipline the better, for in this way only are freedom, responsibility, and the good life possible. Through free choice man becomes a moral agent responsible for his own acts and capable of reaching upward. Moral Courage But it takes real courage to climb upward in the face of obstacles. It would be easier to follow the line of least resistance, to ignore the future, to dodge responsibility, to blame the devil, et cetera. This, however, is not the way of righteousness nor happiness. The lowest order of action is inactivity, laziness; the next is blind action, ignorance; the next is conforming action, obedience; the next is creative action, initiative; and finally, the last and highest is responsible action, progression. Responsible initiative is made possible by the free agency with which man is endowed, and it is only through using this that man is able to reach forever upward. There is too much whimpering and dodging today; too much 671 cowardice in the field of morals; too little courage. If a thing is right it is our duty to abide by it, regardless of the friends we may lose or the immediate inconveniences we may encounter. Life is eternal, and there is a moral law in nature that provides just compensation for all actions, either now or later. The roads ahead are ours-and we are free to choose which way we will go. But we are responsible for the way we go and in this responsibility lies the basis for moral living. May we live for eternity, not just for today, with vision and courage for what lies ahead. Problems for Thought and Action 1, What does it mean to say that man has free agency? How did he get it? Defend the case of free agency against the philosophy of fatalism which opposes it. How can man be foreordained but not predestined? If special reports on these subjects were assigned a month ago have them given now and discuss the points of view offered. Why does free agency make moral responsibility imperative? Why is the attempt to dodge responsibility immoral? Name and discuss some of the ways people try to dodge responsibility. To what extent should we blame the devil for our weaknesses and mistakes? Discuss. Why does every right carry with it a responsibility? Why may free agency be either an opportunity or a liability? 2. What is the moral law of the universe? What do we mean when we say that judgment is largely self-operative? Are personal consequences involved in every personal act? Are the full consequences of every act realized in this mortal life? Discuss. 3. Why is loyalty to a principle more important than loyalty to a person? What is the difference between leadership and headship? Why is it immoral to be irresponsible in the use of position or authority? Give examples of this and discuss the reference from the Doctrine 672 and Covenants cited in the lesson. Is the arbitrary and dictatorial use of authority ever justified? Discuss, Why is self-control important in the moral life? 4. What is moral courage and why is it important? What are the levels of human action? Why would responsible creative action be impossible without free agency? Why is it necessary for the greatest happiness and the greatest good? What does it mean to live each day for eternity and why is this important? 5. Study the following poem by William C. Clegg and point out its application to the lesson: Know this, that every soul is free, To choose his life and what he'll be; For this eternal truth is given, That God will force no man to heaven. He'll call, persuade, direct aright, And bless with wisdom, love and light; In countless ways be good and kind But never force the human mind. Bring to class a copy of William Ernest Henley's poem "Invictus" and show its relevance to the discussion. If time permits look up and use other poems, scriptures, and quotations on the subject.
