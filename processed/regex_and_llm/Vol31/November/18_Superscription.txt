SUPERSCRIPTION Jessie Miller Robinson As long ago, a monk with patient strokes of care Rubbed out a worldly ode to cover with a prayer The priceless vellum; Lord, I ask thee to erase All wrong desire, and write pure Love upon my face, -Theology Church History Lesson 5?The Kirtland Period Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, February 6, 1945 Objective: To study the beginning of the "rising up and the coming forth of my church out of the wilderness" (Doc. And Cov. 5:14). THE spring of 1830 found the Church of Jesus Christ organized again upon the earth. The pattern was once more outlined whereby men could enter the kingdom through faith, repentance, and the waters of baptism, which rebirth then brought confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost. These four simple acts provided a way SO clear that none could err therein. Yet they were profound enough to touch the lives of all living souls even to the four corners of the earth. God had promised believers that "signs would follow" those who did his will which now could be explained by his authorized servants who held the Holy Priesthood. The promise was that his church should "rise up and come forth out of the wilderness." This was an inspiring yet awesome thought. To those who had embraced the new faith and reflected upon its. Wonders, the following reason became apparent. 'The Lord had said the church of men had forms of godliness but denied the power thereof. Could he therefore plant a personal testimony in the hearts of those who were to seek him through the leaders of Christendom who sought not his will but their own? No, the truth must come through humble men whom the world called weak and despised, men of the earth, nourished as it were in the wilderness, apart from the more frequented paths of social life. His voice again would come through such servants crying repentance. If it was hard, as we have seen, for the first favored members of the "little flock" to believe, what then might be expected of others, unschooled in the ways of the Lord, who were to hear the gospel message? Often changes in life are painful even if all the evidence for such changes is apparent. In temporal matters the need for new patterns of living often reveal themselves, but in things of the spirit, only those Page 659 660 who are willing through faith to learn, may see. The Church was organized but its paths ahead were to lead through the struggling ways of little known regions. On Sunday, April 11, 1830, the first public meeting of the organized Church of Jesus Christ was held. Oliver Cowdery, its second elder, delivered its first public discourse. Six new members were baptized that day, and seven the following Sunday in Lake Seneca. Later in the month, Joseph Smith held meetings in the home of Joseph Knight at Colesville, Broome County, New York. It was during these meetings that Newel Knight, a son of Joseph Knight, became possessed of a devil which the Prophet cast out. Newel had promised to pray in the meeting before his friends, but became timid when the time arrived. Still exhibiting faith in the power of God, he sought his Maker in the woods nearby, at which time he was possessed by the evil spirit. So miraculous was his healing, that he and many of those present, who witnessed the event, later became members of the Church. This first miracle of the Church, it should be noted, followed as a sign for those who had believed and attended the meetings. It did not come to satisfy the skepticism of scoffers. Things of wonder spread rapidly. "A church of miracles and a new Bible," went the word over the countryside. Both at Colesville, where he had been, and at Fayette to which place he returned, the talk of strange things came back to the Prophet. On the first day of June 1830, the first conference of the Church was held in Fayette. The outpouring of the Spirit was rich. Many baptisms followed. After the conference Joseph returned again to his home in Pennsylvania, and soon after this, with his wife, he went once more to the home of Joseph Knight in Colesville where he found many who believed ready for baptism. Plans were laid for a service. And a dam was constructed. A mob of the neighborhood set to work tearing this dam away. 'The service which was to have been held on a Sunday was of necessity postponed until Monday. Peace was not to be had from then on at the Knight home. During another visit from the Prophet a mob surrounded the house. Joseph faced the angry men in vain, endeayoring to pacify them. Events moved on, culminating in the arrest of the Prophet on two different occasions while serving the Colesville Branch. At the end of both trials he was set free, nothing having been proved against him. During these troublesome times the Lord remained close to Joseph revealing to him his mind and will. At the Whitmer home, with the assistance of his wife and David Whitmer, the early revelations were arranged and copied. In June of this year came what is known as the "Visions of Moses" (Pearl of Great Price, p. 1). August brought another visit from a heavenly messenger with instructions concerning the administration of the Lord's Supper (Doc. And Cov., Sec. 27:1-4). It was in this month of the year, too. That the break occurred between Joseph and his father-in-law, Mr. Isaac Hale, and the Prophet and his wife Emma went to live at the Whitmers. Things in Fayette were not all favorable for Joseph. Dissensions LESSON DEPARTMENT had arisen among his followers there due to a stone in the possession of Hiram Page, one of the eight' witnesses of the plates of the Book of Mormon. Spurious revelations had misled many, even some of the most prominent members, such as Oliver Cowdery. In the name of the Lord the Prophet informed his friends that these writings were from Satan, and called upon Oliver to induce Hiram Page to do away with the stone and all it had brought. This was done with the result that a complete settlement of differences then existing in the Church followed (Doc. And Cov. 28:1-8). In the revelation concerning the matter of the stone, the Lord also called Oliver Cowdery on a mission to the Lamanites. 'There was a positive look forward in this revelation. If in one way his purposes apparently are thwarted, he will accomplish them in another. Throughout the early rising of his church in the wilderness there are many instances of this. Often in the very midst of trouble and dissensions among the saints, would come the call to new and distant fields of service. The Lord knew where his sheep were willing and ready to hear his voice, and would instruct the servants of his organized Church to carry the message to them. Those who were big enough to heed his word and rise above their petty grievances, lived to bring added joy to their own testimonies, and strength to the Church through new converts. The promised gathering of Israel lay at the base of these missionary journeys (Doc. And Cov. 10:65-66). With the missionary zeal that followed, a flood of new names was entered upon the Church. Many 661 of these became forever a part of the Mormon story that goes to make up the rise of the early Church of Jesus Christ in the fullness of times. Parley P. Pratt is one such name, This man, born April 12, 1807 in Otsego County, New York, and later a resident of Ohio, had returned to the East as a Campbellite minister. While on his journey he saw for the first time a copy of the Book of Mormon. He became converted, and joined the Church on the first of September 1830. In October of 1830, Parley P. Pratt was called with Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer Jr., and Ziba Peterson to carry out the first mission to the Lamanites earlier revealed to Oliver Cowdery (Doc. And Cov. 32). It was on this mission which took the elders through Kirtland, the town near which Parley P. Pratt had owned a home in Ohio, that he visited his friend Sidney Rigdon. Other prominent Church leaders in addition to Rigdon were brought into the faith as a result of this mission, such men as: Isaac Morley, John Murdock, Lyman Wight, Edward Partridge, Frederick G. Williams, and Newel K. Whitney. All joined the Church and helped to provide a haven of refuge, even though but temporary, for the Prophet and his followers in the East, who, because of bitter persecution, were finally given the command to "assemble together at the Ohio" (Doc. And Cov. "But beyond Kirtland traveled this first party of elders. They passed through Sandusky, Ohio, thence to Cincinnati, to St. Louis, and finally on to Independence, Jackson County, Missouri. On this trip in addition to converting hundreds of souls 662 to the Church and establishing many branches, they presented the message of the Book of Mormon to the Catteraugus Indians near Buffalo, New York, the Wyandots near Sandusky, Ohio, and to the Indians of the plains, the Delawares, across the Kansas River. In February of 1831, it was decided that Parley P. Pratt should return to Kirtland with the great news of the mission just completed. Upon his arrival in March he found the Prophet there to greet him, Joseph having come because of the wish of the Lord which was made known during the third conference of the Church held January 2, 1831, at Fayette. In Ohio, he had said, the law of God should be given them and they should be endowed with power from on high. The Kirtland period of the Church which rose "clear as the moon" is so richly filled with the wonders of his word, that not one, nor dozens of lessons could adequately cover it. We shall have occasion to study more in detail at a later time the far reaching results of the few years roughly between 1831 and 1838, that go to make up the first large gathering of the saints in the country called Ohio. To name the more important things that occurred in or about this beautiful town of Kirtland will quicken the imagination of any Latter-day Saint. The Presiding Bishopric was organized; the Law of Consecration or the United Order was introduced; the first distinctive ordination to the office of High Priest was made; the Word of Wisdom was given; the First Presidency of the Church was organized; the first High Council of the Church was called; Zion's Camp, of which we will hear more in the next lesson, was marshalled; the Twelve Apostles were chosen, as also were the first and second quorums of Seventies; the Pearl of Great Price was translated; the Doctrine and Covenants was presented to the general assembly of the Church; and, as the crowning achievement of this period, the first temple to the Lord in the fullness of times was erected March 27, 1836. Only through the failure of the saints as a whole to comply with the commandments of the Lord did dissension and financial difficulties arise, which brought on bitter persecution for all, eventual apostasy for many, and removal to Missouri for those who'remained faithful. Yet even in the most bitter days of failure for this Kirtland period, the Lord set his people face forward again by commanding three of his apostles? Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, and Willard Richards to open a new vineyard on the foreign soil of England. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for our life in this day. 1. When the President of the Church rises to address a general conference session he may be looked upon as any of the great seers of ancient Israel. Why? At the third conference of the Church held on January 2, 1831, at Fayette, New York, section 38 of the Doctrine and Covenants was: given in the presence of those LESSON DEPARTMENT assembled. Read this section and pay particular attention to verse 32. What two things are promised the saints in this verse? 2. How does the higher law as given by Christ embrace the lesser law?the Ten Commandments? The fulfillment of the first promise made in verse 32, that pertaining to the law, came, and is recorded in section 42. This section is fraught with great meaning for all who have taken upon them the name of the Lord. Its careful study will show Christ's love and mercy offered to those who will strive ever to keep the law. The fulfillment of the second promise is recorded in part in section 110. Read this section in class. 663 The next question may be used if needed for further class activity or it may be assigned for home study. Read the beautiful dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple, section 109. Extra readings: sections 28:14-16; 30, 32?the call of the first missionaries to the Lamanites; sections 34; 35; 36?the word of the Lord to Orson Pratt, Sidney Rigdon, and Edward Partridge; section 52?the sending of missionaries forth, following the fourth conference held in Kirtland, June 6, 1831, to assemble again in conference next at Missouri.
