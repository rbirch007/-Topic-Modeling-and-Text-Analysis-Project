Money Isn't Everything Olive C. Wehr “I wish you wouldn't go, Alice." Jack Hayden's big, work-hardened hands lifted in a brief gesture of appeal, then dropped hopelessly as he concluded, "Money isn't everything." His young wife bent her auburn head to examine the worn knee of a pair of her son's brown cords, then folded them decisively into the large, shabby family suitcase spread open on the bed. "Do we have to go all over that again?" she asked wearily. "Just because you are rooted to the 'good earth' is no reason I should go on grubbing my life away, doing without things, getting older, wearing last year's clothes—" She stopped abruptly to search hastily for a handkerchief. Jack's face reddened, and his Adam's apple moved convulsively. Fifteen years ago when he had married the pretty, impetuous, little district school teacher, some years his junior, his mother had prophesied that she would not be content for long to remain on the ranch. He had scoffed at the idea then, and the years had passed swiftly and uneventfully. Now it seemed that the break had come. Maybe it was the war, he reasoned to himself. It did things to folks. Alice had never been like this before. "Listen, honey, this has been an unusually dry year," he explained in his slow, patient drawl. "Got to expect a lean year now and then. Next year, like as not, there'll be bumper Page 618 crops, and then we can start buildin' an'—" "That's precisely what you said last year," she flung at him, her dark eyes flashing. "But I don't aim for you to work," he began. "No use arguing, Jack," she retorted, snapping shut the lock on the bulging suitcase. "My mind is made up. If you won't leave the ranch and go out to the Coast where you could make all kinds of money, with half the work, then I'll go alone! I'll stay with Mable. She has an apartment and the two boys can play together while we are away working— they're old enough." "If you will go," he groaned, "then leave the boy here with me. It's no place for him." "Don't be selfish, Jack," she commanded. "He will have opportunities he has never had before—city schools, music, everything he can't have here. Don't you see? It's for his sake I want to earn money, lots of it, and give him a chance in life. He is getting older now, and he is beginning to need things we can't afford." She turned to him and laid her head against his arm. "Jack, don't be selfish," she pleaded. "Can't you see it is best for him and for me? Won't you come with us? You could get work. You have lived on this ranch all your life—you're just afraid." He shook his head. "It's not that," he said slowly. "I can't exactly explain. I've always wanted the boy to grow up here as I did." MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING 619 “And never get anywhere in life!” she flared. "No, Jack, it takes money" Maybe, Alice, it's like the Big Book says, 'Money is the root of all evil/ The desire for money—"If you quote that again, I'll scream!" she interrupted defiantly. "Listen, I can quote scripture, too. 'As a man soweth, so shall he reap, but I note you sowed wheat last year in the wheat field, and all you reaped was thistle and wild mustard. . . . O Jack, I'm sorry! I'm just overwrought." "Hi, Mom, we got a letter!" A whirlwind of a boy with long,
coltish legs, and a thatch of red hair burst into the room. In one hand he carried an air-mail letter and in the other a half-eaten carrot. Alice took the letter mechanical-"It's from Mable," she commented. "She said she would write me
bus connections." "Mom, when we go out to Seattle, may Bill and I go to the movies every night?" asked the boy eagerly. "No, of course not! Not every
night," she replied crossly. "Well, what will there be to do then?" he demanded.
"Maybe you better stay here. Son, with me," his father said softly. The boy stopped crunching his carrot, and stood, legs far apart, looking from one parent to the other. Both stood silent, tightlipped and pale. Understanding dawned at last in the boy's bright blue eyes, and he rushed from the room, sobbing brokenly. Slowly Jack faced his wife. "I guess you're right," he admitted thickly. "Ed better go with you —for the boy's sake. Phone Abner, tell him the ranch is for sale— at his figure." "Jack, darling!" Alice cried, and ran to throw herself into his arms; but he brushed blindly past her. She followed him out onto the long, cool porch, and watched him as he strode across the meadow to
Where the boy lay, face down, in the Alice wiped her eyes. The dear goose, she thought. She wouldn't have gone without him. A woman had to force her husband's hand sometimes, just as Mable had said. He would be better off, once she got him away from the ranch. Then they would begin living— marvelous wages-good times-every advantage for the boy. It would be nice seeing Mable and George again, too. It had been frightfully lonely since they had moved away some months ago. How she had missed the friendly smoke that used to wave a silent greeting
to her daily from the chimney of the roof she could see rising above the hill beyond the pasture gate! Her husband and son were coming toward the house now, arm in arm. She noted for the first time that Jack's shoulders sagged as he
walked. He looked old, defeated, and suddenly strange, she reflected in some alarm. At the yard gate, he and the boy turned for a long look at the sunset
beyond the purple-shadowed hills to the west. They both loved those wooded hills where they had so often gone fishing and hunting together. They were daily growing more companionable, she thought gratefully, (Continued on page 649) .
