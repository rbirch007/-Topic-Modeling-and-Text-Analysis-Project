NOTES TO THE FIELD Notice of Special Ward Relief Society Meeting to Be Held January 30, 1945 (Fifth Tuesday) "THE General Board of Relief Society recommends that all local Relief Societies hold a_ special meeting on the fifth 'Tuesday of January 1945, relating to the non-use of liquor and tobacco. Our Church leaders, as well as many civic, business, and welfare leaders in the United States and other countries are concerned over the alarming increase in the use of alcohol and tobacco. It is desired that this problem be considered by the Relief Society in a special meeting devoted entirely to this subject, where the standards of our Church with respect to the non-use of alcohol and tobacco may be re-emphasized, and the advantages and blessings of abstinence discussed. Following is a suggestive program for this meeting, but local Relief Societies may, of course, plan their own programs if they prefer, provided they carry forward the purpose of the meeting. The Church's General No-Liquor- Tobacco Committee, headed by Elder Joseph F. Merrill as chairman, with headquarters at 40 East South Temple Street, Salt Lake City 1, Utah, directs the activities of similar no-liquor-tobacco committees in stakes and in wards on which priesthood quorums and auxiliary organizations have representation. It is suggested that ward officers might call on the Relief Society representative on the ward or stake no-liquor tobacco committee for assistance with this program if more pamphlets or reference material are desired, and that the Relief Society representative on the ward no-liquor-tobacco committee be asked to give one of the talks. The references in the suggestive program include a pamphlet distributed through the General No-Liquor-Tobacco Committee. It is suggested that requests for copies of pamphlets be made first to your ward or stake no-liquor tobacco committee, and that if they cannot be obtained through this means that requests for copies be sent direct to the General No-Liquor-Tobacco Committee.

Suggestions for December Work Meeting CHRISTMAS this year will perhaps have a deeper significance than ever before because of the tragic condition of the world today. Let the last sewing day of this eventful year be a preparation for the true Christmas spirit. On this day there may be sewing that must be taken care of, but would it not be interesting to have a few innovations? Somebody has said, "The Christmas tree in our homes is a symbol 634 of Christ as the tree of life, who offers freely to all his gifts of light, and life and wisdom." Would it not be interesting to include in the work meeting program suggestions on how to attractively and inexpensively decorate a Christmas tree. A tree glittering with ornaments, shining with tinsel and icicles can be made very attractive; but where these are difficult to obtain, ornaments made of bright-colored paper, strings of snowy-white popcorn, pine cones and other inexpensive trimmings might well substitute for the commercially made and more expensive tree decorations. Some people are fond of the silver trees decorated with blue baubles and blue lights. For this, tree radiator paint and a spray gun will be needed. Some people like to use the white frosting made with white hot-water kalsomine mixed according to the directions on the package and applied by slapping the branches with a brush. Then, there are the lovely Christmas greens, the mistletoe and holly, and the red and white candles. These, too, are symbols of Christmas and add to the spirit of the occasion. Suggestions for the attractive use of these during the holiday season would, no doubt, be of interest to Relief Society members. In every ward there are excellent cooks. Recipes for cookies, plum pudding, fruit cake, cinnamon apples, and cranberry jelly might be exchanged. A demonstration showing how festive the Christmas table can be set and how to arrange a center piece is always appreciated. This year, it may be difficult to purchase just the items we would like for Christmas giving, and those available will, no doubt, be expensive and of wartime quality. Why not have the women' bring their own sewing and exchange ideas? There are many fine suggestions that might be made for making such articles as lovely handkerchiefs and dainty aprons. There is a need for laundry bags, and guest towels. Dolls are scarce and expensive this year. Rag dolls and stuffed animals can be made very attractive and at little expense. Doll clothes might also be of interest to mothers with little girls. Luncheon sets made of monk's cloth outlined with colored thread or those made of butcher's linen appliqued with colorful materials are very pretty as well as useful. In the words of Annie Wells Cannon: "Now may the Christmas candle burn in every window, and the light of love in every heart." For additional suggestions see: "For Christmas This Year' Nellie O. Parker,, p. 675; "How to Glorify Christmas Gifts,'' Lucile W. Wolf,, p. 816. Suggestions for Choristers and Organists Song Practice The knowledge of songs can be enlarged considerably in Relief Society organizations if the two song practice periods each month are carefully planned. New songs should be presented from time to time, and appropriate songs should be selected not only from the Relief Society Song Book but from other Church NOTES TO THE FIELD songbooks. It is advisable that the chorister and organist rehearse together so that they may learn the songs thoroughly before offering them to the group. The new song should be rehearsed just long enough to give the women a general idea of it; it may be taken up in more detail in the next song practice. Some of the period should be used to improve the singing of familiar hymns so that the members may sing with greater fervor and enjoyment. While it is conceded that the standing position is best for singing, yet after hurrying through a busy morning in order to attend Relief Society meeting, many women find it very tiring to stand for any length of time. 'Therefore, it would be considerate on the part of the chorister to have the audience remain seated for most, if not all, of the practice period. Nothing should ever detract from the spiritual uplift and enjoyment that can come to us from singing together. Suggestions for Special Occasions Many groups of Singing Mothers have already planned special activities for the coming season. They are working on new program numbers 635 to be given on various occasions 'n their wards or stakes. Some have chosen the Thanksgiving holiday as the time for a special musicale, featuring thankfulness for the earth's bounties as the central theme. Around this theme they will group their songs and readings. The stage for a Thanksgiving musicale may be decorated in beautiful autumn colors, creating a festive atmosphere. Other choruses are preparing special musical programs for the Christmas holidays, improvising a program around a lovely Christmas story, using Christmas chorals along with other appropriate numbers, displaying a "living picture" of one or two of the famous paintings of the Madonna and Child, the Manger, the Wise Men, the Christ Child, et cetera. The Christmas cantata is always a favorite with both singing groups and audiences, it can generally be prepared in a few weeks' time. The work of the chorus can always be lightened by having a special trio or double trio do one or more of the chorus numbers. Requests have come for the names of Christmas cantatas for women's voices.
