Income Management In Wartime Claire P. Dorius "Thrift is no longer a private virtue. It is a patriotic duty." Anon. MOST of us have been trained to think that the word income is measured always in terms of money. Howard F. Bigelow in his book Family Finance gives a much broader view to the meaning of income. In the terms of Bigelow's real income, our attention is drawn to a sense of appreciation for the goods and services that are available for our use. Have we been taught, and are we teaching our children to gain real satisfaction from a well-ordered home in which one can find equipment wisely chosen, some good furniture and furnishings, fine books and magazines, with a few good pictures and opportunities for some of the best in music? Real income may also include the capacity to enjoy a beautiful sunset or a walk along the countryside. This type of income is not of course a money income. Our enjoyment of the opportunities and goods that come to us grows out of the training and development we received in our childhood. The writer recalls a visit to a certain home in which money had been spent lavishly. The materials and furnishings were in beautiful color harmony and arrangement, but the rooms did not contain one single book nor magazine, and not a musical instrument. Even the flower arrangements were all artificial. This might serve as a perfect example of money income Page 464 with no appreciation or understanding of real income. We must not, however, forget the fact that the wise use of money income is essential to a successful family life. An unwise expenditure of the money available often leads to frustration and unhappiness. The feeling of financial security is a great factor in the building of a satisfactory home. 'The present emergency demands have brought drastic changes in the consumption pattern of the American people. Many families on fixed incomes are having to do some very careful planning in order to make it possible to buy bonds, pay taxes, and keep up long-time investment obligations, and provide adequately for family members. Postponement of spending for certain items until the postwar period is vital for controlling inflation. 'The family budget is more than ever important today as an effective tool by which to adjust to the new war economy. Let us be careful to make that budget simple, convenient, flexible, and adequate for essential needs. In drawing up the blueprint for the budget in war economy, the most important things must come first. Therefore, at the top, taxes and savings will be recorded. Next will come the allotment for food, followed by all other necessary items in order of importance. Many families are shifting to moderate or INCOME MANAGEMENT IN WARTIME low-cost diets. If we follow the diets recommended by the Bureau of Home Economics, there need be no significant sacrifice in adequacy. Much friction in married life over the question of money can be avoided if the husband has a broad viewpoint regarding it. He should not believe that the man alone earns the income, but rather that the wife's services in the home enter rightly into the financial equation. 'The husband's salary or income should be regarded as a product of mutual effort, and its management, a subject for joint consideration and administration. Had this plan been followed universally, some mothers who have gone into war jobs, leaving their small children to care for themselves, would no doubt have preferred to assume the home responsibilities as their contribution to the war effort. The use of money in wartime presents special problems. Many families have more money available now than ever before. It is a temptation to buy new clothes and furnishings that one has forgone in the past because of a lack of money. But we are being told constantly that it is patriotic to buy only what we actually need. The pre-war dress which hangs in the closet will clean better and look prettier than the one that is displayed in the shop window. We must learn to make over our clothes and keep those we have in top repair. It may be difficult to have more money than you have ever had before and be so restricted. Remember that boys and girls won't be in such great demand for jobs when the soldiers come home. Savings put away now for the future will come in handy when they are badly needed. 465 Why not urge the young people to assume more of the family's financial responsibilities with some of their extra earnings? Perhaps some debts incurred for John's or Sally's education are still unpaid, or there may be more payments yet due on the mortgage on the home. Bills from the doctor and dentist may be worrying the head of the household. By taking the advice of the family doctor?wearing the proper amount of clothing, observing sensible habits, and providing well-balanced diets, we can keep the expenditures for medical services at a minimum. Ellen H. Richards, the founder of home economics education, once said, "There are today many temptations to spend for things attractive in themselves but not necessary to effective living."

Page 466 Ni: EYDE PARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 2?The Book of Mormon Revealed For Tuesday, November 7, 1944 Objective: To show that in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established" (Doc. And Cov. 6:28). THE power of God which Joseph Smith learned to know as a result of his prayer in the Sacred Grove was now a living reality to him. As with all great moments in life, so it was with this. The young Prophet spoke but little of it, except to those whose sympathy and understanding he felt might be relied upon. 'Thus it was to his mother and family he first confided his experience with God. Then, as one would expect, he turned to the leader of the faith in which he had been interested. "Some few days after I had this vision," he wrote, "I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement(See Lesson One); and, conversing with him on the subject of religion, I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had. I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not only lightly, but with great ate saying it was all of the devil...."" (Joseph Smith 2:21). Such an attitude by a professed minister of religion certainly would have left an honest and impressionable boy wondering. For had _ his vision been as the preacher said? from the power of evil?then the least Joseph might expect from a man of God was sympathetic understanding. He and others like him "ought to have been my friends," he wrote, "and to have treated me kindly, and if they supposed me to be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and affectionate manner to have reclaimed me" (Joseph Smith 2:28). But such was not the case nor could it be. The Lord had said they (the manmade creeds) had a form of godliness but 'they denied the power thereof. Joseph, then, for himself must be convinced of the truth of this statement since he, at first, would be required to stand alone in the knowledge of that power. IE, as he soon saw, the great majority of professed believers in religion would not be his friends, then, in learning this truth, he would of Page 467 468 necessity be drawn closer in friendship to God. Three years passed following that wonderful morning in the Sacred Grove; and, during these years, Joseph learned to know firsthand how truly God had described the religions of men. He found it was not necessary to tell his story of the vision again and again, even though he might have chosen to do so. Others told it for him. He merely had "to affirm" its truth. After his experience with the Methodist preacher wherein he "took occasion to give him an account of the vision," he wrote, "I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all sects? all united to persecute me" (Joseph Smith 2:22). It must then have become evident to the young Prophet, that if God was to show him the way to life eternal?and that way was to be for all men who would believe?then other means than a_ personal testimony of his vision would be necessary. With faith strengthened under persecution, Joseph pursued his work about his father's farm until the twenty-first of September, 1823. On that night, after he had retired to his bed, he was desirous to know his standing before the Lord. In prayer he sought His Maker, confident of obtaining a divine manifestation, having had one before. "While I was thus in the act of calling upon God," he wrote, "I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my_ bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor. He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom. Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him I was afraid; but the fear soon left me. He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people. He said there was a book deposited. Written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. LESSON DEPARTMENT He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants; Also, that there were two stones in silver bows?and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim?deposited with the plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted "seers" in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book" (Joseph Smith 2:30-35). Here was a real and earthly evidence of the power of God to doubting men?another record containing the fullness of the everlasting Gospel as delivered by the Savior to the. Inhabitants of ancient America! Moroni not only told of the record, but gave evidence of the divine source of its safekeeping by citing prophecies in the Bible which spoke of its coming forth. He said, however, that a period of time would have to pass before this book from the earth ?a proof of God's power?could be given through Joseph to the world. After this communication, the heavenly messenger disappeared, but only to return again, twice more during the same night, with the same message word for word, until Joseph heard the cock crow, and observed that day was approaching. Shortly after this he arose, and went about his farm work. His father, observing that all was not well with his son, told him to return home. Upon attempting to cross a fence near the house, Joseph sank to the ground and lost consciousness. A voice called him. It was that of Moroni. Again Joseph heard the 469 identical message of the night before at the conclusion of which, this time, he was told to go and tell his father of the vision and the commandments which he had received. This the boy did, and found sweet joy in the way his parent accepted his account of the same, saying, "Go and do as commanded by the messenger." Immediately after, therefore, Joseph went directly to the hill in which he had been told the plates were deposited. Having seen this hill four times in vision, he had no difficulty finding it. There, on its western slope, "not far from the top, under a stone of considerable size" he saw the plates. With them was the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. He made an attempt to remove them, when again Moroni appeared and forbade him, saying that not "until four years from that time" could he expect to receive them. Further he said, wrote Joseph, "that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time, and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates" (Joseph Smith 2:53). Four years did pass from that day on the 22nd of September, 1823, during which time Joseph worked on the farm, and, later, to help the family finances which through a misfortune had become depleted, he hired out to a Mr. Josiah Stoal. This gentleman set him to the task of working his silver mine which was located in Harmony, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. It was here Joseph met Emma Hale who later, January 18, 1827, became his wife. The young Prophet kept faithfully 470 his appointment with the heavenly messenger every 22nd of September. Finally, almost eight months to the day after his marriage, he went to the hill for the last time and received the plates from the hands of  Moroni. The word that Joseph Smith had in his possession some golden plates spread rapidly. If men were not willing to believe this young Prophet?s story of the power of God revealed in his first vision, they were certainly not slow rushing to disprove the earthly evidence that some power had produced?evidence which fanned anew more bitter and sever persecution for this once, obscure youth from the rolling farm lands of upstate New York. But, try as they would, men of evil designs could not and did not stop the bringing forth of this American witness for Christ?the Book of Mormon. Within this Book of Mormon is recorded the fullness of the Gospel once again for the world? the Savior's Gospel with its sweet and precious truths to enlighten the mind and quicken the heart of all who hunger
after righteousness. During the translation of the ancient record from which the Book of Mormon was produced, Joseph found new friends whom God raised up to aid him in the work. Friends who, with him, were to bring again to earth the true Church of God with all its power and right to act in the name of Deity. The Book of Mormon thus became a second witness for the Christ, the first being the Bible. The Lord has said that in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. Suggestions for Active Reading And Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the Doctrine and Covenants to discover
wherein we must ''give heed unto His word" which has been written especially for our life in this day. the Doctrine and Covenants which is a part of the message which Moroni delivered to the Prophet on the night of September 21, 1823; and note well the great sweep of things to be accomplished. Have the class explain: (1) the significance of "reveal the Priesthood"; (2) "dreadful day of the Lord";(3)"plant in the hearts"; (4) "whole earth would be utterly wasted." (The teacher will find historical enrichment for t his discussion following Section
2 in the Doc. and Cov. Commentary.) 2. The story of the power of God, as
felt by one of those who came to the aid of Joseph Smith in his translating of the Book of Mormon, can nowhere be read more directly than in Sections 3 and 5 of the Doc. and Cov. Here is the story of Martin Harris who later became one of
the three witnesses to see the angel and view the records. (The teacher should
study the notes of these Sections found in the Doc. and Cov. Commentary, and come prepared to relate or have related by a class member, the part Martin Harris played in helping the Prophet. See also Joseph Smith 2:59-65. With this as a background have Sections 3 and 5 read in class. Wherein could one apply the value of the lesson, taught here to Joseph Smith and Martin Harris, to his own life? Cite verses you best remember. The next question may be u:ed if
needed for further class activity or it may be assigned for home study. Just how is the coming forth of the Book of Mormon "a marvelous work?" Can you list five or more startling facts concerning its discovery, its story, its influence, its translator, its power? Read Section 4 of the Doc. And Cov. LESSON DEPARTMENT And especially the notes on this Section found in the Doc. And Cov. Commentary. 471 Note: See the article "The Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon" by Preston Nibley, in this issue of the Magazine, P. 431 432. Visiting Teachers /Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes Lesson 2?Blessed Are They That Mourn For Tuesday, November 7, 1944 "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted" (Matt. 5:4). Objective: To point out that even thou sorrow may be appeased, and he may find c Lord. NEVER were more soulful words spoken than these. No one who grows to maturity remains untouched by sorrow?escapes mourning. People mourn for righteous reasons; some because of mistakes which they have made. This is the godly sorrow, spoken of in the Scriptures, that worketh repentance. It is the sorrow that brings reformation. All who mourn because of their weaknesses and who have a sincere desire to overcome them, are in the pathway to repentance; and true repentance brings to every soul "that peace that passeth understanding." Repentance is one of the most glorious and comforting principles revealed from heaven. Another source of righteous mourning is through the loss or misfortune of loved ones. The Master taught that mourning should be lifted above bitterness, and crushing grief. It comes to all; and if it is borne with faith and submission, it elevates, ennobles, and sanctifies the soul. To mourn with others, to share their sorrows, to sympathize with the in their misfortunes to help the, is to render a service that is satisfying and comforting. The Scriptures tell us it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting. This is true, because when one goes into the presence of the departed he searches his soul for the meaning of life and death; he sees things in the light of eternity; and thus he is able to equate the true value of experiences, to know the permanent and satisfying, and what is only fleeting and transitory. This is a day of mourning the world over. There are many who are mourning the loss of loved ones. 472 Surely those who have lain so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom shall be blessed and comforted. The words of Isaiah, coming across the centuries, carry a spirit of hope and comfort to those who are called to mourn during these anxious and troubled days of war: The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me_ to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn, To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified (Isaiah, 61:1-3). How solacing are these words of the Master: "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted." Literature New Testament Lesson 2?Story Telling in the New Testament For Tuesday, November 21, 1944 MANY of the events recorded in the New Testament exemplify rare art in story telling. With simple sincerity, with fervor, yet fine restraint, with flowing musical sentences, dramatic incidents in the life of the Savior and His Apostles are portrayed. Added to this, the stories make great truths live. Our best way to feel the force of these statements is to read and reread them, both for spiritual uplift and for appreciation of their artistry. To stimulate and direct this study, selections from the various Gospels of the King James translation are presented in this lesson. For easier reading in line with the central purpose of this course, the stories are arranged in literary form. Let each of them be read silently and aloud. Then study them in light of suggestions that follow. THE ANGEL AND THE SHEPHERDS (Luke 2:8-14) And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night: And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. LESSON DEPARTMENT And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, Good will toward men. An outstanding characteristic of this story is its lyric qualities. Voiced appreciatively, its sentences sing. They are rhythmic. Various expressions in it also bring beautiful pictures: "shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night"; "the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger." In the lines, too, are dramatic touches: the fear and the consolation; the announcement of our Savior's birth; the chorus of angels, singing peace and good will. It is small wonder that this story has been an inspiration through the ages for musicians, painters and poets, as well as for evangelists. TEMPTATION OF JESUS (Matthew 4:1-11) Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil: And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 473 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. This story is dramatic in its rising effect. Observe how. Matthew, with terse, thought-laden sentences, portrays the event. Step by step it moves in climax to its splendid close. Skillfully recorded conversation drives home living truths. THE RICH YOUNG MAN (Mark 10:17-23) And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me. 474 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions. And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God. Note again the thought-filled sentences, the dramatic strength, yet simplicity, with which Mark, like Matthew, presents this little drama out of real life. CHRIST BEFORE PILATE (John 18:29 ff.) Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to dent... Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. Observe with what restraint this stirring incident is portrayed. With simple directness, with no useless description, we are given the story. Yet how surcharged with controlled emotion, how vital is the scene; and how filled with spiritual meaning the words of the Master as He replies to the questions of the Roman ruler. It is drama of highest art. MARY MAGDALENE AND THE SAVIOR (John 20:10-17) Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre. And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. LESSON DEPARTMENT She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. Again, note the artistry, the delicate touches with which this story is portrayed. Its depth of feeling is brought forth, not with ornate language but with expressions of vibrant simplicity. Every hue in this beautiful little drama of our risen Lord touches the heart strings, and uplifts the responsive soul. Suggestions for Discussion and Activities 1.
