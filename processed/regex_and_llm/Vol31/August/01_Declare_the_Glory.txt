DECLARE THE GLORY Vesta P, Crawford "The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork." I still must walk with faith to beckon me For there is much I cannot understand; The world is filled with depths of wonderment, The reaches of the sky and the familiar land; Earthbound, I walk to feel the bladed grass, The mist of morning and the veil of night, And yet there is a reaching in the heart For that which lies beyond, for further light. Consider the stars our Father has ordained Like silver lamps above our common ways, The glory of Andromeda, the Pleiades, And matchless Vega with unnumbered days; The turning worlds must move in symmetry Within the pattern that is given there? The flame of Rigel's torch, Capella's fire, The Compass Star, the shining of Altair. The universe records its vast design, There is no boundary to space and years, The jewelled planets neither rise nor set But turn within the orbit of the spheres. Earthbound, I walk to touch the bladed grass And feel the breath of wind upon my face, And yet this night my eyes are lifted up To see the stars in their appointed place! VOL. 31, NO. 8 AUGUST 1944
