Notes from the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104. RELIEF SOCIETY WAR AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES THE 1943 annual report, published in the preceding July issue of the Magazine, summarized accomplishments for the year, but space limitations precluded inclusion of any of the many interesting narrative reports received from numerous stakes and missions. The following excerpts from many of these reports relate principally to the war and welfare services carried forward in the stakes. Similar reports from missions will appear in a later issue of "Notes From the Field." Portland Stake (Oregon) "TERESSA S. JOHNSON, president of Portland Stake Relief Society, wrote in May of this year: "In accordance with instructions from the General Board, we have encouraged all Relief Societies in the wards of our stake to take advantage of the Red Cross home-nursing classes in each community where they are available. We have just completed a very successful twelve-week course in home nursing, in which the five Portland wards participated. Three classes were held each week with a total enrollment of seventy-nine Relief Society women, ranging in age from twenty-three to seventy years, and including many Page 454 young mothers. 'The course required twenty-four hours in class, and sixty-one women completed the course and received certificates. Through the efforts of Sister May Randall, president of Moreland Ward Relief Society, in helping to promote these classes, we procured the services of Sister Lou S. Firth of that ward, who is a registered nurse and licensed Red Cross instructor. Her very efficient and capable management of the classes, together with the sincere and humble spirit she radiates, and her desire to give all instructions that would be most helpful, truly made these classes most inspirational and outstanding. "Since in these times it is often impossible to buy many of the necessary sick-room supplies, instructions were given on how to make them from materials available in most every home. These included bedpans and covers, bedroom slippers, paper bags, and many other things from newspapers, and back rests made from large cardboard boxes covered with oilcloth so as to be easily kept clean. Many other suggestions for making useful articles, including bedroom furniture for the sick room, were given. "On April 14, 1944, films and NOTES FROM THE FIELD lectures on communicable diseases, and the Birth Atlas were given to the three classes, and an invitation was extended to all women and girls over twelve years. About 1 56 attended. This was also given two weeks later to men and boys over fourteen years, "As a final feature of our home nursing course, a special demonstration was held to review and explain again how to make articles for use in the sick room, with stake board members and officers from the five Portland wards in attendance. Wards were encouraged to make these articles and keep them on hand, along with their ward first-aid Kits, "Some of the wards have already given many of these useful articles to the sick and homebound in the homes visited, adding greatly to their comfort. We have advised them to do this instead of giving flowers or other things which are expensive in these times, when everyone is asked to do his part in buying bonds for the war effort. We hope to have these useful homemade supplies on hand in each ward so they can be given when needed. "Sister Firth was given high praise by the Red Cross when she turned in her report to them, A gift was Presented to her from the members of the three classes as a token of their appreciation for the benefits they had received." San Diego Stake ( California ) a very interesting summary submitted by Mary McKay Christiansen, President, and Lucia Kemp, secretary of the San Diego Stake Relief Society, we quote: "Our ward organizations have one day a week assigned to them for sewing 455 mending, quilt making, et cetera, at the welfare center, and some of the women take the work home to do. One good sister, much past seventy years old, has made fifty fancy pillows from salvaged welfare material in a year. These have a ready sale at $1.50 to $3 each. "The women of the stake have donated hundreds of hours to the canning plant, and many have helped members of the Priesthood gather crops from the stake field. "Through the efforts of the stake board, seven lovely sacrament cloths were given to servicemen in different camps near San Diego. Also. Through suggestions from the board, women in the wards, sponsored by their Relief Societies, have given blood to the blood bank." Box Elder Stake (Utah) IN response to the request of the US. O., the fourteen wards of our stake arranged for hostesses each week, and have been doing so for nearly a year now. We have a representative on the U. S. O. Council... A suggestion was made that the books in the ward libraries be donated to the library of the veterans' Bushnell General Hospital at Brig ham City. This was done, and the Red Cross librarian was grateful for this addition to the hospital library" Josie J. Jeppson was released last February as stake Relief Society president, and Beatrice B. Hansen was appointed to this position. Mt. Ogden Stake (Utah) ELLA B. FARR, president, and Katie Empey, secretary of the Mt. Ogden Stake Relief Society, submitted the following summary: "We obtained permission to use the canning plant in our region to do community canning as well as welfare canning. This, perhaps, was one of our greatest missionary endeavors as people joined in this project who had not had contact with the Church for years. Joyous, happy participation was evident in every ward, and 52,505 cans were stored in the combined cupboards of ward members as a result of their efforts. Much of the produce, too, was grown in their ward gardens.
"The health of our people in the main has been good; but, in lieu of the shortage of nurses, some wards have organized a volunteer group who have taken turns spending a day with the sick when needed.
"A great service has been rendered by our women to the Red Cross. They have gone in groups to the Red Cross rooms to sew. They have taken sewing into their organizations and into their homes. They have knitted countless articles, have sent hundreds of dozens of cookies to the servicemen's canteen, and have served at the canteen. Many are serving at the U.S.O. and as nurses' aids, and are loyal to every call made in the war bond drives, and in every other way they can serve.
"Never before in our stake has there been greater enthusiasm for the work meeting than at present, and this we attribute to the joy the women receive in contributing to the Church Welfare Program. We made the assignment the second stake in Utah (first) of one quilt for every one hundred people in the ward, and the complete assignment of 500 quilts was sent on January 31 to February. The rest of the assignment of seven dozen shirts, four dozen house dresses, and three dozen children's dresses was just as willingly done, and the women were eager to serve not only for those in need but also to get their own supplies in order.
"We have obtained from a local clothing manufacturing company a great many pieces that would otherwise have been sold for quilt scraps, and the women are combining these and are making aprons and children's dresses in unbelievable numbers, a few of which are shown in the accompanying picture."
This work was done under the direction of Estella Hansen, stake counselor in charge of sewing and welfare work, and called for the ingenious use of many small strips and pieces Sister Hansen, who also directed production of the quilts and several dozens of other articles for the Church Welfare Program, planned well and carefully in order to cut material to the best advantage, selecting patterns which would cut with little waste and still provide clothing of good style and fit. The report continues:
"When the Church Welfare sewing assignment was first presented, it was suggested and urged every ward to equip a work room. This matter was presented to the bishops at the monthly stake welfare meeting, and their assistance and cooperation were most helpful. Where two wards are using the same building, the wards have combined their equipment and sew on alternate Tuesdays. Where those in charge of sewing are the wards plan well, the entire monthly assignment is finished in one day, beginning at 10 and, in order to give every possible assistance to the ward, the stake representative selected patterns with care as to economy and style, and cut and finished a sample of the month's assignment. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 457 A few of the many aprons and articles of children's clothing being made from small pieces by the Relief Societies of Mt. Ogden Stake, under direction of Estella Hansen, stake counselor in charge of sewing. Note the combination of plain and printed material, and even the combination of two prints in the same article, some of same design but different coloring, and some of different pattern but of harmonizing color. Strips left from cutting the pajamas at lower right made the boy's shirt at lower left, and the dotted sections of the apron at left. The little girl's apron at top was made from quilt block pieces. Twelve yards of pink-checked material made thirteen of the tots' dresses like the one in center of the picture. The sample is displayed at the monthly union meeting where the following month's assignment is given, and cutting problems are discussed if material has not already been cut before being issued to the wards. Ward leaders bring in their finished work at the following month's union meeting, and project slips are made and returned to bishops so that wards may be properly credited with the completion of the assignment. We find it most advantageous to distribute and collect assignments monthly." Bannock Stake (Idaho) ANNA LLOYD is president of the Bannock Stake Relief Society whose narrative report included the following: "A baby clinic with a local doctor and county nurse has been held once each month during the year. Arrangements for the house and all other assistance possible has been given by the Relief Society stake board. "As our welfare project for the year, each family was encouraged to raise a garden and can enough vegetables for its own use. And each ward was asked to see that, where necessary, the families received help in canning their vegetables. 458 "As the Relief Society contribution to the stake welfare budget, each member was asked to contribute fifty cents toward the purchase of 100 pounds of butter and to provide a part of $100 to turn over to the welfare committee. The wards made forty-five welfare quilts which were put in the storehouse. Shelley Stake (Idaho) ANNIE B. JOHNSON ls president of Shelley Stake Relief Society which reported: "We have representative reports from each of out wards of the canning done in the homes by our Relief Society women, and these reports of a little better than 500 quarts of fruits and vegetables per family, also an adequate supply of stored vegetables, and some meats canned and cured. This would give us 254,500 quarts for over 549 Relief Society members. Our bedding survey shows adequate bedding in most homes with steps being taken to supply where there is a shortage." This stake also gave sewing Service at a stake welfare sewing center where they did quilting, weaving, buttonholing, and altering, and helped women with their own Sewing and remodeling. Reno Stake (Nevada) BERTHA J. PURDY, president of Reno Stake Relief Society reports: "During the year 1943, the Reno Stake Relief Society officers have endeavored to acquaint the ward and branch Relief Societies with educational pamphlets and pictures on the value of new dress materials, Tayon hose, household linens and draperies, and the care of these items. Furnishing pamphlets on victory gardens, home canning, and giving the latest information on food values, together with proper selection of foods for different age groups in a family. This has been helpful in starting the use of the forms furnished by the General Board for welfare work. "Due to the fact that Reno Stake does not have a central storehouse, we have urged the sisters to help one another in making quilts, and in general to encourage the family unit to prepare for the future. Stake officers have been co-operative with the stake Relief Society officers by allowing us the privilege of calling some of the ward or branch Relief Society officers in when the bishops come to the stake center for their meetings. At these meetings many questions have been answered, exhibits displayed of handwork and of first-aid kits as recommended by the General Board, and demonstrations of methods of canning, drying, at these early morning meetings preceding stake conferences. The mass feeding demonstration was under the direction of the Red Cross nutrition chairman. The director of the Mono National Forest Service assisted by lending and setting up equipment. Many of our members have taken the nutrition, canteen, and home-nursing courses given by the Red Cross." NOTES FROM THE FIELD North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho) THE following excerpts are from narrative reports Prepared by May W. Andrus, president, and the counselor in charge of welfare work of the North Idaho Falls Stake: "Our twelve wards and branches are carrying on their Relief Society work, some under serious handicaps and difficulties, but with a sincere feeling of its importance. The attendance record is much lower than we would like because many of the members are at work in dehydrating Plants, as salesladies, and taking the place of men and boys on farms, et cetera. "The response made by the wards last October to the call for contribution of temple clothing for the new Idaho Falls Temple was very fine, Many of the wards were all prepared to contribute suits of clothing when the call was made. Others felt they would like to donate cash as materials were scarce at that time. Every one of our organizations gave either articles or cash. Many of the stake members have their own suits ready for use when the temple opens as a result of the effort and encouragement of the Relief Society. "Last March a stake banquet was held to secure additional funds for the new stake house. The Relief Society women Planned, donated fruits and vegetables from their cellars, and served twelve hundred people. "Our welfare assignment for 1943 of twenty-five quilts and 112 cases of beans and 112 cases of corn, was filled by the help of all wards and branches. The quilts were divided among all organizations and the 459 stake board. Twenty-nine quilts were turned in. "The canning Program was assigned to the wards nearest the canning center, the rural wards raising the vegetables, and the three town wards furnishing the women to help at the center. We completed 140 cases of beans and 112 cases of corn, The total woman-hours at the canning center was 912, with 211 women participating, "After the canning program was Over, we arranged for three of the town ward Relief Societies to furnish women for the sewing rooms at the Red Cross one day (Thursday) a week, In co-operation with the Mutual Improvement Association, they have given many hours of service in the gauze room, mostly evenings. We have asked the Red Cross for bundles for our rural women to work on, but with our help their quotas are met and available materials used, and so they don't want to send bundles out. Four of our wards and branches are in other counties and do Red Cross work At Dubois, one Relief Society counselor is chairman of the Red Cross. "We have a Project among our board members of visiting the sick at our Latter-day Saint hospital. We obtain a list from the office and try to see that the people farthest from home and from our distant branch and ward are remembered." N unusual and interesting suggestion for making quilt tops from stocking tops has been submitted by Edith Southwick, a member of the Caltman Ward of North Idaho Falls Stake. 460 She aptly calls this suggestion? The Last Leg "Seven years ago I made a quilt top from the tops of men's socks which were cut off above the heel and then opened, making a piece about seven and one-half by eleven or twelve inches. I put a pair of worn-out woolen blankets in the quilt instead of a batt, used a flannel material from the tails of farmers' winter shirts for the back, and tied it with yarn from a pair of old bedroom slippers, so the cost was only for the thread. Later, I made one the same way from the legs of ladies' silk-and-wool winter hose. My idea was to help those who didn't have good bedding. Last week I started a top from ladies' cotton hose to give to the Relief Society, and I am sure it will wear with an outing back, as my quilt from the silk-and-wool mixture legs has been used for six years. I would be very happy if this idea could be of help to the Relief Society sisters over the Church now that we are making so many quilts. One would never believe what a soft, lovely quilt hosiery tops make. I wouldn't part with mine for any price. One reason is that it was my own idea." Phoenix Stake (Arizona) MARTHA E. NELSON, secretary of the Phoenix Stake Relief Society of which Mable D. Mortensen is president, reported: "The Phoenix Stake Relief Society had charge of a dehydrating project at the U. S. Government Indian School last summer. All material dehydrated was donated to the school, and our people were invited to do the work at the plant for one half the dehydrated finished products. We received at the end of the project 2460 pounds of dehydrated potatoes and 1140 pounds of dehydrated carrots. Each family doing work on the project received potatoes and carrots as pay, which helped to increase food stocks in many homes. "About 300 family first-aid kits have been distributed in our stake, and each of the larger wards has a first-aid chest, and a survey of the stake has been made for home-nursing equipment available upon call. Our welfare assignments have been filled 100 per cent for 1943; and 1944 assignments are well under way.": Alpine Stake (Utah) THE executive officers of Alpine Stake Relief Society, of which Fern A. Walker is president, submitted the following narrative report: "The Relief Society sisters of the Alpine Stake have been very loyal in supporting and helping in the Church Welfare Plan of our stake. When the assignment came to the Alpine Stake for one quilt to every hundred members, the various ward Relief Societies willingly ?_accepted their allotments and, by the end of May 1943, forty-two quilts were turned in to our stake storehouse. In addition to this quilt assignment, 435 hours were spent by 103 different women at the stake sewing center during January, February, and March. "For the canning project in our stake, 248 women spent 991% hours at the canning center for Church Welfare, snipping beans, preparing fruits, corn, beans, and peas for canning. NOTES FROM THE FIELD These women Prepared 9,200 cans of fruits and vegetables for the Church Welfare Program, "In addition to the welfare canning, nearly all families used facilities of the center for their own canning. "Every ward in our stake followed the advice of the General Board in Preparing first-aid kits. Two Red Cross home-nursing classes were given during the year. Those sisters who took these classes have assisted the school nurse during the year in the different immunization clinics, and the pre-school clinics. The supplies for emergency care." Snowflake Stake (Arizona) THE Snowflake Stake Relief Society, of which Leonora S. Rogers is president, reported: "Red Cross courses in nutrition, first aid, and home nursing were held in nine of the wards this year, many of the women participating in more than one. These courses helped the women to handle the first-aid kits that were purchased and placed in all of the wards. The increase in in juvenile delinquency reported throughout the country stimulated a ?Better Youth Project? for the four meetings during the summer. An appropriate topic was Prepared by the stake board and sent out to the wards for presentation in the monthly work meetings. The young girls in the communities were invited in to hear these topics. We feel that our efforts did some good. ?A survey to locate any needy people in the wards was made, in July, by the ward Presidents, and the results reported to the stake welfare committee. During the same month the visiting teachers carried a circular to all the homes urging a check on the food supply and food needs for the coming winter. The aim was to see that every hoe be supplied with fruits and vegetables, and that provisions were being made to conserve and preserve sufficient in every family. If any families desired help, it was to be supplied while the foods were available for conservation. "A contribution of bottled fruit and vegetables was made to the two maternity hospitals in the county? each woman being asked to donate one quart. A generous response was made. "Letters of sympathy and love have ben sent by the stake board to any families of servicemen in our stake who have been reported dead or missing.? Rexburg Stake (Idaho) following excerpts relating to war and welfare work are from the very comprehensive narrative report of the Rexburg Stake Relief Society: "In spite of the unsettled conditions Prevailing in most of the homes and Organizations, due to the war and its rapid encroachment upon our lives, we feel that this year, 1943, has seen much accomplished by the women of the Rexburg Stake Relief Societies, "Instruction classes offered by the Red Cross were well attended; 121 received certificates in home nursing, twenty-two in first aid, and seventeen in nutrition. Many wards have given substantial aid in rolling bandages and assisting with sewing at the Red Cross centers, 462 "All assignments for the Church Welfare Program, including the allotment of fifty-three woolen-pieced quilts, have been carried out with the full co-operation of the ward officers and members. Early in the year, the stake Relief Society executive officers met with the ward presidents at the welfare center, and together they sorted, boxed, and labeled all articles of used clothing which had been collected. Those not suitable to be used in the condition in which they had been received were cleaned and made ready for use. Many of the old wool sweaters were sent to be made into batts for quilts which were made from wool pieces salvaged from the collection. "Under the direction of Elizabeth Stowell, stake Relief Society president, a project launched two years ago?that of compiling a short history of every ward since its organization?was completed. In many wards early records had been lost, and this loss necessitated many hours of search through stake and ward priesthood files to obtain the necessary data. There are now on file in the stakehouse vault the completed histories of all the wards and of the stake organization. It is an inspiration to learn of the labor and faithful devotion to Relief Society of those women who pioneered this valley, many of whom have passed away. "When the assignment was received for temple clothing to be furnished for the new Idaho Falls Temple, the stake board assumed the responsibility of supplying some of the articles, and the wards contributed the others. The stake assignment was completed in August and delivered to the custodian of the temple at Idaho Falls in September ?the first in this temple district. "Another project undertaken by the board during the summer was the providing of white suits for the use of the children at the monthly baptismal services at the stake tabernacle. After a committee appointed for the purpose had investigated the various types of clothes, the board decided to use a short one-piece play suit for the girls, and long white trousers and sport shirt for the boys. Twenty-four suits are now available and are stored in a cabinet at the tabernacle. They are rented for the cost of laundering, which is twenty cents. Since many adults in the stake have recently applied for baptism, the board plans to provide several suits for adults in the near future. Oakland Stake (California) RUTH S. HILTON, president of Oakland Stake Relief Society, wrote in a letter dated May 2: "All of our ward organizations are participating in Red Cross activity. Members go in groups to the Red Cross centers and also to the blood bank. Also, many of our Relief Society women are giving liberally of their time to the U. S. O. And hospitality centers. In fact, our Maxwell Park organization, under the supervision of Counselor Irene Schatz, was instrumental in organizing a center, under the sponsorship of the A. W. V5S., near the local naval hospital at Oak Knoll for the men who are convalescing and are unable to go the distance to the larger centers. We know that these women are rendering invaluable service in this particular center, and we are indeed proud of them. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 463 The majority of our women have taken majority of our women have taken advantage of the courses offered in first aid, home nursing, nutrition, et cetera. We have supplied the Oak Knoll Hospital with a large number of afghans, as well as some bedding.
"The welfare work is gradually consuming more and more of our time and attention. The sisters seem to find real joy in the common projects which this work affords them. We are right in the midst of renovating our particular quarters at the welfare plant. Since the counselors in our stake and ward organizations have become work directors, we feel that this type of work is being conducted more efficiently. The highlight of our recent activities was a meeting of all ward presidents with the stake executive officers, held Sunday, February 27. With the consent of our stake presidency, we asked the ward Relief Society presidents to come into Oakland to discuss the use of Relief Society funds for the 1944 welfare clothing assignment as authorized in Bulletin No. 23. We feel that the spirit of the Lord was with us at this meeting. Each sister bore testimony to the joy and satisfaction which come from her work. The cost of our 1944 clothing assignment was apportioned and promptly met. In spite of acute shortages in many lines assigned to us, about one-half of the material is now purchased and our buying committee, under the direction of Sister Inez McFarlane, stake work director, is pushing this work forward as fast as possible. We believe that the entire assignment will soon be obtained. The next step of cutting and sewing will move forward without difficulty, we feel assured. We are truly grateful for this privilege of service and the many others which our Society gives to us."
St. Joseph Stake (Arizona)
GRACE M. CLUFF, president of the Central Ward Relief Society reported:
"Ours is a small ward of St. Joseph Stake?we have about sixty-five members. In complying with the wishes of the General Board to see that families of our ward had plenty of bedding, we made sixty-seven quilts during the summer of 1943. We made four welfare quilts and four quilts for the organization bazaar; all the rest (fifty-nine quilts) were for the members of our organization. Every Tuesday we held an all-day quilting. We divided our ward into four groups and each group put on one quilt and quilted it off each Tuesday. The group finishing first helped the others. We certainly had the support of the sisters."
San Bernardino Stake (California)
EVELYN WILDE HEATH, president of San Bernardino Stake Relief Society wrote:
"We had occasion to be particularly happy and grateful at our stake conference, October 10, 1943. We had made our Church Welfare assignment of fifty quilts to the Relief Societies of the various wards, and had set our October conference as the time for completion. Considering that many of our wards are small, and also that they had heavy quilt assignments for their ward first aid kits, it was indeed gratifying to have each ward complete its assign-
