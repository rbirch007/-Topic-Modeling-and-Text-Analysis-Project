Mormon Pioneer Culture Alice Merrill Horne Former Member of Relief Society General Board S one who has crossed paths A with the first pioneers of Utah, I remember with gratitude the distinguished personality of those gracious men and women, They came determined to cast off the shackles of the ages; they came to build a New Jerusalem; they would cleanse themselves by sacrifice to do this thing. They left behind them trails of rich romance; they builded well; artists dwelt in their habitations. Close by reaches a great branching tree. Its roots search for the deep soils, that, set free from stones by winter frosts, have come down with floods to this safe mountain fastness., Art is like that. To grow to great proportions its soils must be patiently brought together until they reach depths sufficient to provide safe anchorage for widely spreading roots against the shock of wind and weather.. American Art has not found Opportunity to become deeply rooted in the soils needful for mature ripening, because, from its foundations, America has been passing through Stages of rapid transition. Expediency, ever Art-shy, became the uppermost question in the dividing up and parceling out of the Atlantic Seaboard when its acres were thrown open to Old World colonizers. Because the Pacific Coast was also accessible mainly by means of the sailing vessel, California was said to have been founded in a day, and Art found no habitat in the California gold rush. Likewise, into the heart of the great Mississippi Basin a quick flood of settlers poured. They sought land by means of the natural arteries of trade, either the widening Mississippi River, or its deep-flowing tributaries, but even in those rich lands Art found scarcely a resting place. But far beyond those lands of quick colonization waited a Territory, inaccessible, remote, dormant, for builders of an Intermountain Empire, which must bring together certain indwelling traits that would forefeel a real American culture. On the one side, the Rocky Mountains, perpetually snow-crested,: rose to challenge and to chasten the invader of its loneliness. On the opposite border stretched the Great American Desert, whose weary wastes drove back any who sought entrance thereat. Strange indeed, it is, that this isolated West, forbidding in its isolation, became to an earnest people a guerdon in its forbiddance. So entered the Mormon pioneers, history's most intrepid adventurers, carrying hand axes in their belts, driving their tedious ox teams (walking beside them to ease the covered-wagon load) into that remote Territory, And Art took comfort and became the pioneer's wayfarer, for Lo! In the heavy hold of each covered wagon Page 419 were treasures of beauty, were fabrics of fine workmanship, were heirlooms from generations of elevation and subtilization saved for posterity!
For behold! It had come to pass in the Latter Days, that the Prophet Joseph Smith had sent forth disciples by twos, without purse or scrip, preaching to the New World to gather to Zion. Many indeed were the followers at those famed gathering places. And it came to pass that the Prophet called the apostles to cross the wide waters, and they carried the glad tidings of great joy to the Old World.
Among those young Mormon leaders were historians, scientists, statesmen, Christ exemplars, who without purse or scrip, abounding in love and fellowship, once again proclaimed the saving principle "I am my brother's keeper." The harvest was rich. Thousands upon thousands of Old World converts went down into the waters of baptism. At one time, thirty-five thousand Britishers waited to emigrate to Zion in America. The Saints of the Old World turned their faces toward the West and joined forces with the Saints of America, who suffered persecution for conscience's sake.
Thus did a unity of purpose, such as had never been attained before, may never again be witnessed, establish the high destiny of that westward migration.
It was well nigh 100 years ago?to be exact, ninety-seven years ago last July 23rd, that the advance company of those very first Utah pioneers unhitched their oxen just back of where the Lion House now stands. They took their shovels and tapped City Creek and dug the first white man's water ditch in the Americas. My mother's father, President George A. Smith (dubbed "Potato Saint"), planted the first potato. The prayerful pioneers sought for themselves open to the inspiration that the time and the occasion afforded. The men in that advance company that day plowed, planted, and irrigated five acres of crops. But they did more, by that very act of flooding a canyon water ditch over the dormant soil, they proved the desert habitable by white men. For through the knowledge of irrigation the desert could be made to blossom as the rose!
THE message that went to the Old World, as well as to the New, appealed to artists, poets, musicians, singers, horticulturists, decorators, authors, editors, wood carvers, pottery builders, lace makers, orchestral leaders, oratorio leaders, costume designers, and gardeners, so that the first settlers were persons of culture. Thus it came about that for years all that was made was made by hand, beautiful and lit. From their covered wagons the pioneer settlers in every valley of the Stake moved into new log cabins. But the pioneers were home builders and very soon they set up lovely colonial adobe mansions. If lumber was not available from the sawmills, set up on the many canyon streams, the settlers used their cabin logs for sleepers for the new adobe mansions. Red brick came into favor and the adobe made was made by hand also. No furniture appeared in the shops for the reason there were no furniture shops. Because there arose the need for Art to grace those new mansions, something wonderful transpired. Artists set out to answer that need, and presently there appeared handmade, hand-carved chairs, chests, mantel pieces, and center tables. Even carved newel posts graced the stairways. Soon a spinning wheel appeared in each and every home. PIONEER BIGLER-LAMBSON HOME First plastered house in the valley. It stood on the southwest corner of First West and North Temple Streets. The pioneer women, not to be outdone by ambitious wood craftsmen and builders, carded, spun, reeled, and wove wool, cotton, linen, and silk that was raised in the Territory. Chests were filled with towels and blankets. Wool suitable for men's clothes and women's dresses was sewed by hand and fashioned into apparel revealing true style. Floors of beautiful white pine and even of native oak very soon were covered with braided rag rugs and bright-colored rag carpets woven on hand looms. My _ grandmother, Bathsheba W. Smith, ambitious from girlhood, spun and wove a carpet in green and black stripes for her long back parlor in her home in the Historian's Office. That room of dignity and charm made a fitting background for the fastidiously clothed ladies, Eliza R. Snow, Zina D. Young, Hannah T. King, Dr. Romania B. Pratt Penrose, Phebe Woodruff, Sarah M. Kimball, Emmeline B. Wells, Rachel Grant, Elizabeth Howard, Martha Hughes Cannon, Emily Hill Woodmansee, 'Marinda N. Hyde, the sweet songbird Mrs. George Careless, Mrs. Harriett A. Thatcher Preston, and "Ma" Smoot. They visited that room where suffrage meetings, Deseret Hospital Board sessions, Women's Exponent and various "Retrenchment" groups held forth. These ladies were seated in charming rocking chairs, "Congress" chairs and lounges. Fortunately, my own seat was my grandmother's lap. Also for my use was a cushioned stool grandmother had ingeniously fashioned from a log sawn for wood.  HOME OF DANIEL H. WELLS Between these two houses, located on South Temple Street where the Templeton, 7. C. M. I. And Medical Arts buildings now stand, flowed the first white man's ditch in America. TODAY, many examples of those eatly-day fashions in art and architecture have vanished. Here and there are groups of the fine old types of pioneer adobe, rock, and red brick houses, if not the first log ones. Heber City has the best in the State which should be saved and cherished by a grateful people for the sake of history. There were charming coverlets spun of cotton and linen. Many women netted black mitts. Every woman of prominence had at least one white cotton embroidered petticoat. The hand-braided straw bonnets, hand-fashioned and trimmed with colored flowers, were worn by women of style. Each woman seemed to know what would improve her personality?which resulted in style rather than fashion, the women of this era were persons of style and not fashion. The men even had beaver hats. My grandfather Albert Merrill, Utah's first hatter, was kept busy, and sold his "cowboy" beavers at high prices to the first settlers. Then there was the knitting. My! My! How the knitting needles HISTORIAN'S OFFICE Bathsheba W. Smith lived in the Historian's Office. Clicked on men's socks, children's long stockings. White lace for pillow casing was knitted of linen thread. Sik worms were fed mulberry leaves, silk cocoons presently emerged into silk evening dresses, and real laces were made and worn adding charm to artistic bonnets and gowns, and Art took renewed courage and stability. Culture in Utah spread with the completion of the Tabernacle, the building of its matchless organ, and the organization of the Tabernacle choir. The Social Hall provided the perfect background for artistic step dances, and the Salt Lake Theater made all things possible for appreciation of the best in dramatic art. Artists came and went by the famed Overland Stage. Did Ralph Waldo Emerson point to the Mormon pioneers and their posterity when he made the prophecy, "The Art of America will come out of the West, amidst the feet of a brave and earnest people"? Surely the beginning of that West ?the redeemed desert?predestinate what must be accomplished by the posterity of the pioneers, in the days upon the very threshold of which we now stand!
