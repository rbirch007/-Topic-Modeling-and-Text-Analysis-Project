Social Science Modern Applications of Ethical Principles Lesson 2?"Men Are, That They Might Have Joy" For Tuesday, November 28, 1944 Last month's discussion presented a picture of confusion in our times, War was shown to be particularly and a cry was sounded for honest, intelligent effort now, in order to better understand the social and moral problems about us, that we might plan and build for a better world.  Lesson Aim. To develop the thought that happiness is the goal of all human endeavor, the inner quest of the soul; and that the greatest Happiness is the greatest good. It was Jesus who said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." The abundant life is merely the happy life; and happiness is at the heart of morality. The Happiness Goal One need not look far to discover this basic truth. It is conceded, of course, that the average person seldom understands the real motives within him; but, personally recognized or not, the mainspring of human action is nevertheless the desire for happiness. Sometimes it is called by other names?satisfaction, gratification, thrill, pleasure, fun, joy, et cetera; but whatever the name, it is the pleasurable response of the soul that satisfies and that drives men on to action. Satisfactions vary with behavior, it is true, but with all behavior there is some satisfaction, or the behavior would otherwise be abandoned for some other. The most sinful of sinners derives some thrill or satisfaction from his debauchery, as does the most saintly of saints from his righteousness, else he would not so behave. The problem, then, is to discover what it is that brings the higher satisfactions and to eliminate that which does not. Happiness and satisfaction will be used synonymously in this lesson, and to indicate any pleasurable response to human activity. But actions differ in the amount and the kind of satisfaction they bring, and for this reason it will be necessary to 1/John 10:10. 2/II Nephi 2:25. View happiness as relative. Satisfactions of the most pure, supreme, and enduring type we will call joy. Not many years ago there was a popular song which contained these words: "'Aren't we all in search of happiness? To each one it means a different thing. To some it's wealth, to some it's health, to some it's only what love can bring." There is a lot of truth in this statement. The desire for happiness is the drive back of all humanity's search; but it means different things to different persons, and the struggle for it has led men into gluttony, lust, avarice, vanity, and cruelty, just as it has to temperance, self-control, love, modesty, and kindliness. Not every path is equally satisfying; and the highest satisfactions are not in the realm of the physical appetites and material wealth. It was of this higher type of satisfaction that Nephi spoke when he said, "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy."" The purpose of life is the attainment of joy at the very crest of the happiness scale. The Problem of Relative Values But since happiness is relative, the actions which determine it must be judged or weighed as to their relative importance. Things that are good are not equally good, and things that are bad are not equally bad; life has a graded system of values, and he who seeks after the higher ones reaps the greater rewards in happiness. Hugh M. Woodward in his recent book Humanity's Greatest Need LESSON DEPARTMENT 
outlines seven levels of satisfaction:*
1. Satisfactions of passion and physical comfort.
2. Satisfactions derived from physical possessions and personal power.
3. Satisfactions from aesthetic enjoyment in the world of music, art, and beauty.
4. Satisfactions that come from intellectual activity and achievement.
5. Satisfactions from the world of service, altruism, and justice.
6. Satisfactions that come from accomplishment and self-mastery.
7. Satisfactions known only to those who love.
The first is rather intense and of short duration, and, unless used with moderation and control, will weaken a person's capacity for the higher enjoyments.
The second, where followed selfishly without the spirit of justice and right, leads only to disappointment. The others, particularly the last three, are all of a higher order and yield the deeper and more permanent joys of the spirit. Any satisfaction is considered evil only in so far as it deprives the individual of enjoying satisfactions which are better. Man is the chooser, but upon his choice will depend how rich, abundant, and satisfying his life is to be. Several centuries before Christ, there arose in Greece two contrasting moral philosophies. The one, known as Epicureanism, contended that pleasure is the one and only good, holding, however, that pleasure should be sought in honor and justice. The other, known as Stoicism, contended that the supreme good is to accept destiny as it is, and to conform dispassionately, indifferent and alike to pleasure and pain. Both of these philosophies
3/ Woodward, Hugh M., Humanity's Greatest Need, pp. 92-96.
had many followers, and still have for that matter, although the modern varieties are sometimes a far cry from the originals. Epicureanism is sometimes used as an excuse or justification for sensual license, which was never intended by the founders of this philosophy. So much has the concept become perverted and contorted in the popular mind, that the term epicurean is now commonly used to describe any reckless irresponsible pleasure seeker.
Closely related, and almost identical with this concept, is that of Hedonism. A hedonist is anyone who acts pleasure as uppermost in his system of moral values, anyone who acts primarily is interested in the gratification of his pleasure-seeking dispositions. Now this wouldn't be so bad if pleasure were made synonymous with joy, and if the baser satisfactions were eliminated so that the higher ones could be realized. But that, unfortunately, is too frequently not the case. There are too many people today who are willing to indulge on the lower levels of pleasure and thrill, and then to stop there, rationalizing their position on the basis of happiness. Actually, they are only half-happy or less. Those who argue that nothing should be permitted to stand in the way of happiness are right if they have the higher happiness in mind. But, unfortunately, most of them do not. There are too many epicureans in the modern world; too many hedonists blinded by greed and lust.
Patterns of Sorrow and Despair
When the cheer leader calls to his group, "Is everybody happy?" and gets back a loud "Yes!" as is typical in many American gatherings, he does not receive a true answer from his listeners. Although carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, and willing therefore to say verbally that they are happy, many of them, nevertheless, are loaded down with grief and sorrow. Quarrels, fights, divorces, suicides, wars?these and many other trouble signals?bear clear evidence that all are not happy. But why? If happiness is the goal of all, and is accessible to all, why is it so infrequently and inadequately realized? Many reasons could be given, but central. In any explanation would be ignorance, selfishness, and the discovery too late of what might-have-been. Sometimes the struggle for happiness fails because it is too closely tied up with the goal itself, without the realization that the greatest satisfactions come from love and unselfish service to others. Sometimes it fails because of distortions in the value system that the individual adopts; he aims for the wrong things. Sometimes it fails because means and ends are confused, so that, in the struggle for some end, unethical means are used, and in total happiness the individual finds himself shortchanged. If material wealth becomes a primary goal, for example, and the person cheats to get it, he will fail in his happiness quest because of both distorted values and the immoral means employed. Always the search for happiness succeeds where the effort is sincere, intelligent, and unselfish: and always it fails where there is ignorance or indifference toward the value system, and the consequences of acts within this system. Morality and Happiness Can we agree, then: (1) that happiness is the goal of life; (2) that different acts bring different degrees of happiness; and (3). That because of selfishness and ignorance, largely, a great many people never teach the deeper, richer joys within their grasp? What has all of this to do with ethics and morals? Simply this. Since happiness is the supreme goal of life, its most complete realization is the supreme good. If the very purpose of life is the attainment of joy, as we have tried to show, then to interfere with this purpose is wrong, while to foster it is right. Systems of value, which are the framework of ethics, must be built upon the scale of satisfactions, that thing being valued most which brings the greatest total satisfaction, and vice versa. The good life is the happy life; and anything which tends to interfere with the attainment of complete happiness is bad, and, in the broad sense, immoral. Happiness, then, becomes the standard or criterion for moral judgment. Because of this, every individual is morally obligated to analyze himself, find out what is wrong, and then do what is necessary to correct the mistakes and build for the thrills of a higher order. There are aids that will prove helpful in this process of self analysis', but introspection without the use of such devices 4/ See, for example, Hornell Hart, Chart for Happiness (New York: Macmillan, 1940). In this little book Professor Hart discusses a scale that he has constructed for measuring happiness, and for determining the causes of happiness or unhappiness in any particular situation. LESSON DEPARTMENT is entirely possible, though it may not be quite as objective or revealing. Sometimes a discussion with a friend or even a trained psychiatrist will prove extremely valuable in understanding oneself. But, whatever the method, it is important that each individual know himself; if he is unhappy he should understand why, and start doing something about it. It is unethical to remain unhappy. Being wrong innocently, isn't sin, for everyone makes mistakes in the process of growth, but staying wrong is sin. In conclusion, let it be said that the major personal conditions leading to the greatest happiness, and hence the highest morality, are these: (1) the sense of personal achievement and progress; (2) the feeling of comradeship and brotherhood that comes from love and service to others; and (3) good health, both physical and mental, which implies a correct attitude as well as mental and physical efficiency. More will be said about all of these as the lessons of this series unfold, but, in passing, it should be noted that supreme joy and righteous living are both products of the same thing, and that the source of them both is something more than the commonplace selfish thrills of the moment. That which is best requires the greatest struggle to attain. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Examine the thesis that happiness is the mainspring and the goal of all human effort. Can you think of any action that is entirely void of satisfaction to its performer? Why are not all actions equally satisfying? Discuss. Does the Scripture, "Men are, that they might have joy," excuse anyone in giving vent to his passions and seeking after the thrills of the moment? Why or why 479 not? Which of the following terms indicates the greatest satisfaction to you, and which, the least: happiness, fun, pleasure, thrill, joy? 2. What do you understand by the term, relative values? Why are values relative? Discuss Dr. Woodward's scheme for describing the levels of satisfaction. Do you agree with the order in which he has them listed? Try an arrangement of your own and compare. Should the satisfactions of the flesh be avoided entirely, or only controlled and regulated to their proper place? (Draw on Latter-day Saint beliefs in marriage and sexual morality to answer this question.) Is it ever immoral to choose a lower satisfaction when a higher one would have been possible? Discuss. What are Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Hedonism, and how do they apply to persons or situations that you know? 3. Why is there so much unhappiness in the world today? How much is due to social conditions, and how much to personal causes? Can individuals do anything about it? Should they, or is it better to welcome sorrow now, and even seek discomfort and self-denial in the hope that by so doing the rewards will be all the greater on the other side? Discuss pro and con. 4. What is the relationship between happiness and morality? Do you agree that it is immoral to needlessly remain unhappy? Why or why not? What are the three conditions named in this lesson for producing the greatest happiness and the highest morality? Briefly discuss each.
