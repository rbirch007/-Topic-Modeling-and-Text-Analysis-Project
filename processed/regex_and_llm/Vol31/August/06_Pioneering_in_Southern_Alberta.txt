PIONEERING IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA, CANADA Some First Events Jennie B. Knight Oh, would ye hear and would ye hear Of the windy wide Northwest? Faith: ?tis a land as green as the sea?That rolls as far and rolls as free With drifts of flowers, so many there be Where the cattle roam and rest Moira O?Neil SUCH was the prairie land that greeted Charles O. Card and his two companions, J. W. Hendricks, and Bishop Isaac Zundell, when they arrived in Southern Alberta in the fall of 1886.
Zion was growing, so President John Taylor sent Charles O. Card, then president of the Cache Stake, to select a place in which some of the Latter-day Saints might settle. After weeks of searching, an old mountaineer, in British Columbia, told him of a grass-covered buffalo plains country to the east. President Card was so impressed by the story that he and his associates took the train to Calgary, then by team they pushed on over tall grass-covered prairies until they came to Lee's Creek in Southern Alberta. Here, this pathfinder selected a townsite which later was appropriately named Cardston in his honor. These men returned to Utah with such glowing reports of this "cattleman's paradise," and its wonderful agricultural possibilities, that, by April 1887, a number of families had sold their homes to trek some 600 miles and settle in a foreign land. President Card with others?Brothers Preece, Allen, Anderson, Leavett, Daines, Layne, and Matkin, preceded them, and arrived at Lee's Creek in March. Here they broke up one and a half acres of ground, planted a vegetable garden, and made other preparations for the oncoming pioneers.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Zina Y. Card, her two children?Sterling and Joseph?with teams, wagons, and drivers, were en route from Logan to join her husband. John A. and Mary Woolf and their six children, also well equipped, joined them, making a very happy group. Other families were added to this caravan as they journeyed northward.
After long hard weeks of slow travel, they reached Helena, Montana, where President Card met them, he having come from Lee's Creek on horseback. Here he took the lead and their journey continued. On the morning of June 1st, he stopped his teams and, waving his hat, shouted for all to come forward to view a pile of rocks, which, he explained to them, marked the international

Spontaneously, all hats were doffed, then handkerchiefs, scarves, bonnets, and aprons were waved while shouts of "Three Cheers for Canada," "Hurrah for Canada," filled the air.

A pause?and then their prayer, their songs and laughter were borne away by the prairie breezes. The ceremony closed as each placed a rock with the other rocks, as a silent pledge that they would rear monuments of enduring values in the land of their adoption. On, these pioneers went, as far as the eye could see there was prairie! prairie! with only one relief, blue Big Chief Mountain in the distance, then, as now, a reminder of the beloved Rockies they had left behind.
The most breath-taking and hazardous experiences encountered en route were fording the rivers. At such times, the wagons had to be tied down and the teams doubled up. The families then would climb into their wagons with all their precious possessions, and the teams and wagons would plunge into the turbid waters, while the occupants practically held their breath until they landed safely on the other side.
Although it was June before the pioneers reached the St. Mary's River, providentially it snowed all day, and at night a heavy frost came, causing the river to drop two feet. Sergeant Brimmer of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police met them at the crossing, June 3rd, and gave all possible assistance. Wagons, cattle, and all were safely brought across in three hours' time. Joy was in their hearts?by evening they would be home! But when they arrived there, the children with quivering voices asked, "Ma where are the houses?" All they could see were a few covered-wagon boxes placed on the ground. But, like Israel of old, they pitched their tents. They slept soundly, and busily all that night the snow heaped up highway and hollow with a silence pure and white. When morning came there were five inches of snow on the tents and ground, prognosticating a life full of adventure under a new flag. PIONEERING IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA, CANADA 427 Thus, on June 3, 1887, the first Mormon settlement in Southern Alberta was established. Cardston is situated between two large Indian reservations, the Blood Indian reservation being on the north. Their chief, Red Crow, thinking this colony was settling on their lands, came to see about it. He was accompanied by twenty-five braves, decorated with war paint and feathers. One of those who was present, tells of the meeting: "Mr. Card (In-no-ye-sto-ye), meaning 'Long Beard,' gave us a full belly and we had a long talk. After the talk the chief clasped Mr. Card's hand and told him that his children, meaning the Bloods, 'will be brothers and friends to the white man as long as Old Chief Mountain is looking on the earth' "?a pledge which still stands.
The Indians were the first mail carriers. Mail came via Great Falls, Montana, to Fort Macleod, from which place the Indians brought it to Standoff where they swam the river on horseback, delivering the mail to Samuel Matkin who brought it to Cardston.
Some of the old ranchers, also, looked upon the presence of these settlers as an offense to them. It is reported that one morning Mr. Cochrane, a wealthy rancher, asked his foreman to hook up his buggy so they could go and fire the Mormons off their lease. When they arrived at the hill where the Indian hospital now is located, and looked at the little camp of immigrants, Mr. Cochrane stopped the buggy and said, "We shall leave them alone, they will all winter kill anyway," and they returned to the ranch. The same fall, however, all of the men of the colony were hired to put up the ranch hay for the Cochranes, which was a godsend to the people in furnishing them necessary funds. Mr. Cochrane knew what it meant to face a winter with heavy snows, piercing winds, and a temperature which some days reached 62 below zero. These pioneers did not "winter kill"; but, later, their Church purchased the Cochrane ranch containing 66,500 acres, where today may be seen comfortable homes and prosperous ranches of Mormon people.
These pioneers were home builders. Their log cabins soon replaced their tents, and they were made comfortable and homelike by the deft fingers of the women folk. Their homes were a refuge from the storms?a place of peace and cheer for the family?a haven of rest for the stranger.
THE first Church services were held in a tent, and later in the bowery, where, on June 12, 1887, Brother Jonathan S. Layne prophesied that a temple would be built on this land owned by the Church.
The first summer with its glorious long sunny days, its wild berries and flowers, abundant fish, game, and fresh vegetables gave way to early autumn frosts and wintery blasts. On December 17, 1887, the first new babies were welcomed into the community?a little daughter, Zina Alberta, came to the Woolf home; and several hours later, a son, Lee Ora, to the Matkin home. Sister Card,

The first summer with its glorious long sunny days, its wild berries and flowers, abundant fish, game, and fresh vegetables gave way to early autumn frosts and wintery blasts. On December 17, 1887, the first new babies were welcomed into the community?a little daughter, Zina Alberta, came to the Woolf home; and several hours later, a son, Lee Ora, to the Matkin home. Sister Card,
428 with other sisters, attended the mothers and babies. As the first Christmas time approached, the children feared that Santa Claus would not find them in that far-off land. However, resourceful Aunt Zina called a meeting of the mothers at her home. Other secret meetings were held, where mothers went with their scraps and sewing kits, and fathers with carpenter tools and odd boards. The older girls were allowed to unravel old hose and to help with cookies and. Candy. They were as surprised as anybody on Christmas morning when they also received gifts from the community tree, which stood in Aunt Zina's dining room. No one was forgotten. Cheer and gratitude prevailed everywhere; a delicious dinner for every family was followed by a dance in the evening, with music furnished by a mouth organ. Thus ended their first Christmas. New Year was celebrated on the 29th of January by the dedication of their first meeting house, followed by a grand housewarming. The meeting house was built of logs, furnished with homemade tables and benches, and heated by a stove which stood in one corner. Coal-oil lamps with reflectors were hung in brackets on the walls. This building became the community center for all occasions as well as the schoolhouse, where Jane E. Woolf taught the first school. The first bride was the jolly, adorable Amy Louise Leonard, who became the wife of Heber S. Allen, April 2nd, 1889. She was lovely in her long white dress, with its tightfitting, high-necked bodice. The skirt was gracefully cascaded by shirrings and puffs. LATER HOME OF PRESIDENT AND MRS. C. O. CARD, ERECTED 1900 Their reception was a grand affair held in the Church. All adults were invited to partake of the feast. A large, beautifully decorated seven-tiered wedding cake formed the centerpiece of the banquet table. The hospitality and joy which marked this event was symbolic of the life they spent in Canada.. On June 12th, a daughter arrived at the Card home. They named her Zina after her mother and her grandmother, Zina D. H. Young, who had come from Utah for the blessed event, for Cardston was fifty miles from a doctor. President Card, realizing the need of a trained nurse for the community, called Mrs. Elizabeth Hammer on a mission to go to Logan to take a course in nursing and obstetrics. She accepted this call, and, after completing her studies in Utah, she returned to Cardston full of confidence in the blessings given her by the Church leaders, in which she had been promised that she would be a successful nurse among the sick of the pioneer families in the Cardston district, whether they were members of the Church or not. Nearly 400 infants were assisted into the world by this saintly woman without the loss of a single mother. PIONEERING IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA, CANADA LATTER-DAY SAINT ALBERTA STAKE SOCIAL CENTER, CARDSTON, ALBERTA, CANADA She herself was the mother of four children. No community of Latter-day Saints is complete without its auxiliary organizations, and this colony had theirs, also. Mary S. Woolf was the first president of the Relief Society. She and her able assistants at once took up the traditional duties of the organization. They never failed in deeds of charity and social betterment. Only those who have traveled by team over unmarked prairies, encountered unexpected snow and wind storms, crossed swollen streams, and fought dreaded summer prairie fires, can appreciate the courage with which these officers and members of this group carried on. Sarah B. Daine was the first Primary president. Zina Y. Card was the first president of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. John D. Higginbotham, referring to Mrs. Card in his book When the West Was Young, calls her "The Mother of the Mormon Colonies," and says she inherited much of her father, Brigham Young's, energy and ability, that "she was a fluent and convincing speaker, as well as a woman of grace and charm, and exercised a far-reaching influence in the development of Southern Alberta." She entertained and was kind to people in all walks of life. Officials of the Government, of the Church, men of the range or strangers, always found a spontaneous welcome in her log cabin home equal to that which she extended later on in her more palatial brick dwelling. Her own people revered her and called her their own beloved "Aunt Zina." She was loyal to President Card and supported all the enterprises that were so necessary in a new country?such as sawmills, cheese factories, gristmills, and stores. In fact, "toward the development of Cardston and its immediate district, her legacy from her father, of about $30,000, was expended with little return in interest and less in capital." Mr. C. A. Magrath, a prominent, influential Canadian, writing of his 430 experiences in Western Canada says: I visited the Mormons in their small settlement on Lee's Creek in 1887, and was much impressed with what I saw. question if any organization is quite as well fitted for colonization work as the Mormons. Pioneering-life on the frontier always has been a great struggle in order to get established. The community life of a people naturally must be invaluable to the weaker ones of the group, who, if they stand alone, would run considerable danger of failing. I am reminded of an incident of what community life may mean. I remember a young man losing his wife in the early spring. He took her remains south to Utah, when he returned he found ten acres of his land had been ploughed and seeded. In my opinion, the movement of the Mormons to Southern Alberta was of inestimable value in opening up that section of the West, They understood irrigation and we were continually being told of the wealth that could be created by the diversion of some of our waters that were wasting down our rivers, (By co-operation of the Galt interests and the Mormons, the first great canals in Southern Alberta were made.) THE people of Alberta had their trials similar to those of their fathers and mothers who pioneered the Great Basin of the United States. They had their compensations as well? in the marvelous families they reared; in the contributions of valuable citizens and unsurpassed soldiers they have given to their nation; in t he canals they made (the first in Southern Alberta); in the trees they planted; in their beautiful temple; in the first schools; in their homes and churches; and in their grain elevators and sugar factories (the latter the first in the Domin-ion) . All of these proclaim the stability of these Mormon pioneers and attest to their blessings from God in whom they put their trust. Author's Note: I wish to express appreciation to in writing, much of the early history of Cardston, and to the Jubilee Number, of the Lethbridge Herald for much of the information of the Galt interests and the Mormons, the first great canals in Southern Alberta were made. ) HE people of Alberta had their trials similar to those of their fathers and mothers who pioneered the Great Basin of the United States.
