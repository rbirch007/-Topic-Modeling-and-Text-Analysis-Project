FRUITION Leone G. Layton Dedicated to Lydia Purnell Gaunt as a wind-stripped poplar, she Holds up her arms to eternity. Life's storms have swirled about her trunk; Deep from the earth her roots have drunk. No careful nurture in sheltered field But wind-swept wastes have been made to yield. Her strength was drawn from earth and sky; The calm of the heavens deepened her eye, And peace born of faith in One above Who watched o'er her with a Father's love. No dread of the passing in her mien, No senseless whine of what might-have-been. Though weakened her roots, waiting leave of earth Stalwart she stands, welcoming rebirth.
