    "content": "A Memorial to the Relief Society Sisters Bishop LeGrand Richards Presiding Bishop of the Church (Address delivered at the morning session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, Thursday, September 30, 1948). Think you are wonderful. I believe the Lord thinks you are wonderful. I know what Sister Spafford and her counselors think of you because we have talked and visited together a good many times about what you have done. When you launched your Building program a year ago, I did not have any misgivings. I knew you would do it. You are the only one hundred per centers we have in the Church, in fact, I think you might call yourselves the One Hundred Per Cent Club or organization, if you would like to, and it would always be that because, well, having been a bishop of three different wards and president of a stake, and now for ten years having served as adviser to the General Relief Society Presidency, I have paraphrased the old statement that if you want anything done give it to the busy man, and I say, \"If you want anything done give it to the Relief Society.\" 'They never fail. I do not know how many of you have heard Brother Thomas E. McKay's little story about when he was at a stake welfare meeting recently. They were just going to close the meeting when he said, \"Oh, president, we have not heard from the Relief Society and we sure ought to have a word from them.\" And so the stake president called the president of the Relief Society of the stake and she stood up and said: \"Brother McKay, the Relief Society is behind the Priesthood one hundred per cent,\" and the president of the stake stood up and said: \"Yes, President McKay, and the Priesthood is behind the Relief Society one hundred years.\" Now, if there ever comes a day when we can call the Priesthood of this Church the One Hundred Per Cent Club, it will be a great day for the Church I can assure you. When this program was first launched I think the sisters had some little misgivings because there were rumblings went out over the Church and there were some who had adverse criticisms to offer. When the sisters told me just now that I would have more than three minutes, I picked up the Bible and thought of the little experience when Jesus went into the",

    "content": "Heart-deep in Winter Eva Willes Wangsgaard With you so lately gone it seemed untrue That winter had relaxed and spring was near. Half-heartedly the northern ranks withdrew Relinquishing to spring the infant year; And spring came blithely, undisturbed by death. The soil had quickened; I could feel it stir, Perfumed by hyacinths; the morning's breath Was stroking cheek and throat like rabbit fur. The autumn bulbs erupted wells of gold; The lilacs leafed, for day was April warm; But night kept lagging back with icy cold And threatened lily fringe with frost and storm. Heart-deep in winter, unprepared, alone, The night and I and newly lettered stone! Second Prize Story Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest They Die in the Harness Myrtle M. Dean MYRTLE M. DEAN HIS same thing had been hapT pening several times the last few months, Doctor John waking in the middle of the night from fragmentary dreams, starting from his bed. \"It's the telephone, Mary,\" he said, waking his wife. \"Hurry, Mary, see who it is while I get my bag. Someone needs me; someone is sick.\" He had risen to sitting position on the side of the bed, his feet resting on the rug beside it. \"Sh—shh—, John, you are dreaming again. Lie down and go to sleep. The phone isn't ringing.\" There was deep concern in Mary's voice. \"Oh, I thought—I thought the Page 80 phone was ringing; someone wanting me.\" Dr. John rubbed his eyes and shook his head confusedly as he spoke. \"You've got to stop this waking with a start and climbing out of bed; you know it is bad for you, John.\" Mary took him by the shoulders and gently pushed him back on his pillow. \"Now, go to sleep,\" she said, as though she were speaking to a child. He lay quietly, but he did not sleep for a long time, and he knew Mary was awake, too, but she lay quite still, saying nothing. There was that same empty feeling sweeping through him, leaving him trembling and weak. Doctor John Boyd, retired; retired at sixty, he thought. No telephones ~ ringing for you tonight, nor tomorrow, nor anytime at all. Just lie back and take it easy. Let the phones ring for Matthews and Brown and Carson and all the others. You let them tell you you were too tired, too sick, he said derisively to himself. He had known it would be difficult, but he wondered now why he had thought he could make his retirement a resigned sort of thing instead of this nagging discontent which followed him day and night; this sense of falling to pieces like rotten timber and being discarded. It was Dr. Matthews whom his THEY DIE IN THE HARNESS nurse had called when he had collapsed suddenly down at the office last June, and they had sent for Mary. \"You've got to stop this,' Matthews had said firmly. \"This going day and night all during the war has been too much for you. The doctor shortage is over now, John; plenty of them back, now let them take over.\" Dr. John still remembered how bone-weary he had felt, and with Mary there looking so frightened and Matthews shaking the finger of death grimly in his face, he had given in to them. Matthews had said, \"Let your son Philip take over; carry on the Boyd tradition. He has made quite a name for himself, I hear, and has done some fine work in army hospitals.\" HE Boyds had been doctors for four generations. Dr. John remembered when he was just a little boy, how his grandfather, Alex Boyd's little black satchel had held such a fascination for him. \"Would you like to be a doctor, Johnnie?\" his grandfather had asked. \"Tm going to be one, just like you, Grandpa,\" he had answered seriously. Dr. Alex' little satchel had contained not much more than a bottle of chloroform, a pair of umbilical scissors and a bit of cord, and some pink pills in little bottles. Instead of a stethoscope, he tapped with his fingers and listened for sounds with his ear over the chest. Dr. John's own father, Dr. David, was considered a great surgeon in his day. Then Dr. John had come along through horse and buggy days, 8] riding over dusty, winding country roads, then up through the period of rapid advancement in medicine and surgery, and the use of the new miracle drugs. Day or night, Dr. John had always been on the job. He had been very happy when Philip, his only son, had chosen to be a doctor, too. \"Guess it's in the blood, Dad,\" Philip had said. \"That little black bag holds a magnetism we can't get away from.\" \"Tt is hard work, son,\" Dr. John had warned. \"T still want it,\" Philip had answered seriously. Philip had seemed so young when he had graduated from medical school, and John and Mary had been so proud of him. He had just finished his internship when he went with the army, working in army hospitals in London and Paris. The ultimate climax of Dr. John's life was to have been reached on Philip's homecoming, when' they were to enter the new Boyd Hospital at Alton, with father and son working together in this impeccably equipped place. The hospital was the result of a shining dream, of am- | bitions and work winging to heights of splendor. Philip had written from overseas, giving minute details of the latest in instruments, the finest in equipment and structure that should go into it. \"Tt will be wonderful, Dad, the two of us working together,\" Philip had written enthusiastically. Dr. John had hovered about like a mother hen over her brood of chicks, meticulously attending to its building. He had explained to Dr. Matthews when he had told him to stop 82 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 work, \"The new hospital, Matthews, that is for us, Philip and me, working together.\" There had been a note of pleading in his voice. Matthew's next words had been a near command. \"You can't go into that hospital, Boyd. If you do, it will be as a patient.\" Dr. John had forbidden Mary to tell Philip why he was retiring. \"I won't have my son probing me, examining me, putting me to bed,\" he had said vehemently. \"Just tell him you are retiring like anyone has a right to do at your age if one has the means to live adequately. Dozens of men here, no older than you, are retired and enjoying life.\" Mary had spoken so calmly casual that John had burst forth almost fiercely, \"Doctors don't retire if they have any guts. They die in the harness.\". Mary had checked him before he could continue. \"Yes, they keep on until they die like your father. He died at sixty-three. He died in the harness. Your mother was a widow for twelve years. I don't want that, John.\" Mary's eyes had grown dark with fear, and she looked delicate and defenseless as she stood there. Dr. John thought, she has stood by me through all my struggles, but she cannot quite understand that being a doctor is more than a job. It makes one part of life itself, living with people in their happiness and their sorrows, in life and in death. A baby born into the world, a life going out, this had all become a part of him. PHILIP had come home and gone into the new hospital with young doctors Martin and Alder, to assist him. He had seemed puzzled and a little hurt at his father's sudden unexplained decision to retire. Dr. John and Mary had gone away for two months for a rest, but he had grown restless and had returned, thinking perhaps it would seem better at home with people he knew and loved. ) Now as he lay sleepless, deep in the night, memories rushing upon him, he thought, it gets harder as time goes on, not easier. Matthews has my office and equipment, while I stay twiddling my thumbs.\" John had been firm on one point. He wouldn't give up his little black bag and its contents. \"Just as well cut off my right arm,\" he had said. He had placed it on his closet shelf and sometimes when Mary wasn't around he would take it out and finger its contents lovingly. After a restless night, Dr. John always looked tired and pale. Mary eyed him anxiously, but in silence. \"Guess I'll walk down town for a bit of exercise,\" he said as he finished his breakfast. He tried to sound cheerful. \"Better wear your overcoat. It's cold out this morning,\" Mary said. \"Yes, pretty nippy for the first of November,\" he answered, while he thought, June and now November. One marks off the days on the calendar, but nothing makes the days go faster. Only work and living can do that. He met old friends on the street, heard bits of news. He stopped at a newsstand and bought a morning paper, then went into the hotel lobby that was nearby, to rest awhile and read. He chose a big chair off in one end of the long room. There THEY DIE IN THE HARNESS were two, well-dressed men who sat | near his chair. Strangers, Dr. John said to himself. Getting so I don't know folks so well anymore. Lots of new people coming in since the big steel mill was built during the war. | Then a warm glow of satisfaction filled his heart as his eyes fell on a news note in the paper. \"Miracle of Surgery Saves Life of Son of Wealthy Banker,\" was the caption. Then he read on: Car accident causes serious brain concussion and critical internal injuries to young Tony Barton, son of Thomas Barton, prominent citizen and President of the First National Bank of Alton. Credit for the saving of the young man's life is given to the marvelous skill and swift precision of the operation performed by Dr. Philip Boyd at the Boyd Hospital. Young Barton is reported as being in good condition at Boyd Hospital today. My happiness must come, now, through my son's success, Dr. John said to himself. 'Then he heard the two men near him talking. \"A town the size of Alton is lucky getting such a skilled doctor as young Boyd, and having. Such a fine hospital,\" one of them remarked. \"Yes, his father, Dr. John, had the hospital built at Alton.\" \"They say the son isn't a bit like his father. Philip is a big doctor all tight. He has a big hospital, wealthy patients, pretty nurses, everything he needs, but he hasn't the big heart like Dr. John.\" \"He's an only child, they tell me. Maybe that's it,\" the first speaker said with a sarcastic chuckle. Dr. John's hands clenched tightly. His first impulse was to confront these strangers. Such talk would be damaging to Philip. Then, with perturbed thoughtfulness, he 83 sank back heavily into his chair. I must face facts squarely. Philip is our only son. Have we done too much for him? R. John slipped, unobserved, through a side door and moved slowly toward home. As he went in he moved near the fire that burned on the grate, and rubbed his hands together to warm them. He tried to put a cheerful note in his voice as he told Mary little bits of news he had heard in the town, but he did not tell her what he had heard about Philip at the hotel. He did not want her to be hurt. He handed her the paper, pointing to the article about Philip. \"You'll be proud of your son,\" he said, smiling tenderly. \"I knew he would be a great doctor,\" she said, maternal pride shining in her eyes. \"I think [ll drive over to Alton, offer my congratulations to Philip and take a look at the hospital,\" he said then, quite unexpectedly. \"I may not be back until late. See that Martha takes good care of you.\" Martha was their housekeeper who had been with them for fifteen years. John knew that Mary would like to go along and see Philip. They usually went together, but he wanted to see Philip alone today. \"Tell Philip how proud I am of him, too,' Mary said, \"and give Janie my love. I had hoped Philip would marry before now. He needs a good wife.\" \"Every man needs a good wife. What would I have done without my good wife? It is you who have given me courage to do everything I have done, Mary.\" \"Every woman loves to hear her 84: RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 husband say such things, John, even if they are a bit farfetched.\" They had both secretly hoped Janie and Philip would marry, and had suspected that Janie had been in love with Philip ever since she was a girl sixteen. Her parents had both been killed in an accident when she was twelve, and Mary and John had been like a mother and father to her since then. She had become a nurse, and now worked with Philip in the Boyd Hospital. Alton seemed wrapped in a quiescent hush. The great smokestacks of the smelter and mills looked cold and foreboding in the absence of the gray smoke that usually belched from their tops. Picket lines marched in front of the mill gates. The Boyd Hospital stood like a clean white monument on the far side of the town, etched against a background of burnished, autumnal hills; a monument to the name of Boyd.. Philip would be busy most of the afternoon in the examining office. Dr. John decided to look about the hospital before he tried to see him. The sun was shining, trying to temper the cold wind that swept up fallen leaves from the lawn and piled them in little heaps against the wide marble steps. [NSIDE the front hall, Dr. John took off his topcoat and hung it on the rack. He stood for a moment, almost breathless from the force of the cold wind.. He saw that the outer waiting room was already full of people waiting their turn to be taken in. They were mostly well-dressed, the sort of folk one would expect to see in such a setting as this hospital made. 'tention, Dr. Incongruously, among the others, he noted a woman who looked to be a foreigner. She was poorly dressed. Her coat was shapeless and frayed. A boy of about ten leaned wearily against her gaunt side. His face was pale, but a vivid spot burned on either cheek. His breath came in uneven panting jerks. The mother's face was filled with anxiety. That child needs immediate atJohn said to himself, and instinctively he thought of his black bag he had surreptitiously taken from his closet shelf and placed in his car while Mary had gone to bring his muffler. Then he saw Elise Boulton emérging from the examining room. She was wrapped snugly in her sable furs. Her voice was lilting as she spoke to the nurse. \"It will be wonderful to have a nice rest in such a nice room. Dr. Philip says I may have room 16, my same, darling, sunny room.\" \"Yes, you are lucky. The hospital is crowded full,\" Jane said, and then, \"your turn next please,\" she said to another patient. Still the sick child waited. Dr. John felt in no mood to meet Elise. As she went out, he went through a side door and took an elevator to the top floor, thinking to himself, I guess Elise has had another disagreement with Jim Boulton, so is running away, pretending sick, to get his sympathy, and Philip is humoring her whims. Sure, she can pay for the best room in the hospital. He went about the hospital reveling in its perfection. Finally, he glanced at his watch, and knew he must go down if he wanted to see Philip. Time had passed so quick- THEY DIE IN THE HARNESS ly in this Utopian world in which Philip worked.. There were only a few persons left in the waiting room. The woman_and her child had gone in. Dr. John moved to a front window in an alcove of the room. Then, he stood in shocked silence, for he saw the woman and her boy coming out again from the examining room, and he heard Jane's voice saying, \"I'm sorry, but Dr. Boyd says every room is taken, and your son will require hospitalization for some _ time.\" Then, making her own observation, she continued, \"Your child is very ill. You should call your family doctor at once or go to some other hospital. Goodbye,\" she said kindly. A woman who was still waiting her turn to go in, sensing the child's urgent need asked, \"Didn't you have an appointment here? Your child needs attention immediately.\" \"No, I have none. I just come. My boy, he so very seck. I come here. Doctor Boyd so good a doctor. Everyone say that. The paper this morning, it say so too. So I just come. I be here in Alton not so long. I don't know doctors. The strikes, my husband, he have no work now. I come to this good hos- | pital. My boy so seck, so seck.\" She went out murmuring brokenly. FoR a brief moment, Dr. John stood unbelieving and _bewildered, his fists clenched tightly. His first impulse was to go in to Philip, but he heard Philip saying to Jane, | \"T have an engagement now, so must leave. Call Morton down to finish here,\" and he left by a side door to take his car. The woman and child were mov- 85 ing slowly down the front walk. Their battered old car stood by the curb. Without a formulated plan, Dr. John hurried to the door. \"Come on back,\" he called, his voice drifting out to them on the sharp, cold air. The woman turned hesitantly, as though she would brook no further delay. The wind whipped her coat tantalizingly against her thin legs. \"Bring the child back. We will take care of him here,\" he said as he moved out toward her. Her eyes turned up to his, at first_ questioning doubtfully, but she saw the kindness in his face, and turned back murmuring gratefully, \"Oh, thank you. My boy, he so seck.\" Dr. John called Jane and two other nurses to assist him. It was all over in a few hours. 'The child was resting in room sixteen, finest room in the hospital, the room Elise Boulton had expected to occupy at ten the next morning. Dr. John gave quick, concise orders to the head nurse on the floor. \"Keep a special nurse on the case for a few days. Administer oxygen continually until further directed. Watch those drain tubes. There was a lot of pus in that right lung.\" He turned, then, to the boy's mother. \"You must go now. The child needs rest. You may come tomorrow and see him,\" he said kindly. Tears of gratitude welled in her eyes as she started to go, then hesitating a moment, she asked anxiously, \"He will get well?\" He nodded affirmatively, \"Yes, he will be all right now.\" \"Oh, thank you, Doctor—Doctor —I don't know your name.\" 86 | RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 \"[''m Dr. Boyd,\" he answered unrevealingly. \"Oh, I find wrong doctor then. That is it. I find wrong doctor first time.\" She went out, nodding her head and smiling. Then he turned to Jane. \"Don't forget to notify Elise Boulton that an emergency case came in, and has to occupy room sixteen. We'll need it for at least ten days.\"\" There was a cryptic satisfaction in his smile as he spoke. 'Then his face became somber as he studied Jane's face. \"How are things with you, Janie?\" he asked. \"With you and Philip, I mean?\" For a moment her dark eyes grew serious, and wavered beneath his gaze as she answered a bit hesitantly. \"Sometimes I think I am only a part of the impeccable equipment of this place, like the elevator, the X-ray machine, moving like an automaton through his days.\" Then a slow smile lighted her, face and there was an eager, shining look in her eyes. \"Then other times—\" she said, leaving the sentence unfinished. \"Philip needs-you, Janie,\" he said earnestly as he turned to leave. \"But, Dr. John, what about you, you here doing this?\" she questioned, as she motioned toward the child's bed. \"That child would have died. You know that, Janie, but I came here because I had a feeling Philip needed me today, and I needed him, too.\" Jane gave him an understanding smile, and pressed his hand gently as she said, \"Philip needs you every day, Dr. John.\" He turned and drew himself up a little straighter and taller as though a sudden resolve had been born within him. And he said, \"I'll be back again tomorrow, Janie, and each day thereafter.\" A satisfied smile curved his lips, and a peaceful light stole over his face. Eight boys. Is a junior at B. Y. U.

Judd, Member, Relief Society General Board) [Continuity from a recording presented at the annual general Relief Society conference in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Thursday morning, September 30, 1948, at the special session in recognition of the Building Fund achievement. In making the record the parts of living characters were voiced by themselves. ] Narrator: The greatest art of all time will forever be of people, not of things. It was 4 teacher who phrased it thus, and a student who remembered those words.. - - \"of people, not of things.\" Yet we talk of a building. A building that ls structure—stone on stone —wood on wood—marble on marble. It ls, itself, a thing.. Until, we talk of it not alone as a building, but as a dream. Then the building becomes a part of all the people who have dreamed and planned and worked for it. % % * * A part of Zina D. H. Young, who stood, as the third president of our organization, in a Relief Society conference in the Assembly Hall, over half a century agO.--- (Fave) ZINA: The Relief Society needs a house of its own. The women of the Church have done so much to help build other public buildings and temples that they have no means to build one for the Relief Society. Narrator: It is a part of Sarah M. Kimball, who was the general secretary of the Relief Society and who spoke at that same conference, that day in 1896..-- SARAH: I feel it's a humiliation to be without a place of our own. We've contributed to all public places. Now we want to have a house, and we want land to build it on and it should be in the shadow of the temple. It should be a place to receive strangers in when they come, a place where letters can be written from, and information given. The Prophet Joseph Smith gave the sisters in Nauvoo a lot belonging to the Church and a house on it which could be repaired and made useful. We need a house of our own here. Now I want to ask you sisters if you want such a building as I have described. (SOUND: VOICES IN APPROVAL. ) Narrator: 'They wanted it, of course. The voting was unanimous. But it takes more than votes to build a building. It took, among other things, the Sunday eggs. LITTLE GIRL: Oh goody, Mamma! Forty-eight of 'em today. MOTHER: That's just grand, Betsy. Put 'em in the case. LITTLE GIRL: The Relief Society Case, Mamma? MOTHER: Yes, Dear. Page 88 THE SYMBOL OF A DREAM 89 FATHER: Hmmm! Forty-eight! Looks to me like you've got those hens on your side, Emmy. I swear they never lay like that any other day of the week. (FADE) Narrator: Yes, it took the Sunday eggs. And it took the wool from the wire fences and posts and bushes after the flocks had left the enclosure. (FADE) MOTHER: There's some more down by that post, Betsy. BETSY: Oh, Mamma! Haven't we got enough now? MOTHER: Run down and get it. The exercise'll do you good. BETSY: You mean it'll do the Relief Society good! Narrator: Yes, it took the wool. And it took the wheat— wheat gleaned from the fields after the harvesters had gone—Relief Society wheat—a story in itself. To build that building took the co-operative help of the Mutual and Primary Associations. President Lorenzo Snow spoke of the joint project in the pages of the Woman's Exponent in July of 1901: PRESIDENT SNOW: We commend the undertaking and have contributed a valuable building site opposite the temple, valued at $18,000. The women must have $20,000 before commencing the house. NARRATOR: $20,000! That was a lot of money for those days. But Sister Zina was not discouraged. Before a year passed, though, both she and President Lorenzo Snow had been called to the other side. Joseph F. Smith was the next Church President; Bathsheba W. Smith the next Relief Society President. Under her leadership funds continued to be collected for the women's building. But in 1908, the plans were changed; and it was decided that they should include quarters for the Presiding Bishopric. Thus the dream of a woman's building, as such, had to be abandoned temporarily. We contributed $8,000 towards the construction of the Bishop's Building, as it came to be called, and moved into our offices there in December 1909. We've appreciated the offices, yes. But you know how you feel when you've been living with relatives and then get a chance to move into a home of your own. And sometimes, the relatives are a little anxious, too. Elder Marvin O. Ashton had a colorful way of expressing it, when in our Relief Society conference three years ago, he said in his own humorous way: BISHOP ASHTON: If we are perfectly honest with you, and sometimes we are, we should say something like this to President Spafford, \"Success to you in this building.\" And as the host said to his guests, \"Here's your hat, but what's your hurry?\" Our building over there is crowded. You need a new building and so do we need more elbow room. Success to you! I hope I have the privilege of contributing to it. And I'm sure I won't be denied. Narrator: Today, we talk of our building as a dream about to be fulfilled. We talk of it as Sister Spafford did in October conference, three years ago: 50 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 SISTER SPAFFORD: We want our building to belong to the women of the Church, and to have every Relief Society woman feel the pride of ownership in it. We want it to do more than house the general offices. We want it to be of service to all of you. We expect to include in it a comfortable lounge, where you may come and rest, write a letter, or meet a friend; check-rooms where you may leave your bundles; a relic room where choice articles of historic value may be preserved and displayed; an auditorium; well-equipped work and exhibition kitchens where homemaking demonstrations and lectures may be given. And we would like at this time to know your attitude towards the proposed building program. 'Therefore, just as our sisters of long ago called for a vote on this identical proposition, so today, forty-nine years later, we too are calling for a vote of this great congregation. (SOUND: VOICES IN APPROVAL.) Narrator: Again the voting was unanimous. Yes, we talk of a building. And talk of it was high that conference day in 1945. President George Albert Smith said: PRESIDENT SMITH: It's appropriate that you women of the Church of Jesus Christ, the only Church that bears his name by divine authority, should have a home of your own into which you can invite the spirit of the Lord when you hold your meetings. I realize you have been disappointed in the past; you thought you had a house of your own once before, but it turned out to be the Presiding Bishop's office also. But now your prospect seems better, and as you think about it and plan for it, you will be very happy. I don't care how fine it is, it will not be better than you deserve. There isn't anything too good for you as long as you keep the commandments of the Lord. You may be sure that if you do your part, the Lord will do his. Narrator: \"If you do your part, the Lord will do his.\" It is good to know as we dream our building that our sisters of the past have done their part—just as you, in a large measure, have done yours. It is symbolic that the library of the building we dream will carry many precious documents and words—the words, for example, of Sister Lucy Mack Smith, the mother of the Prophet Joseph, who, in the second meeting the Relief Society organization ever held, said: LUCY SMITH: This institution is a good one. We must cherish one another; watch over one another and gain instruction, that we may all sit down in heaven together. Narrator: And we have cherished one another. As Sister Marianne Sharp put it: SISTER SHARP: Ever since Sister Lyman appointed Sister Spafford and me to help prepare the book, A Centenary of Relief Society, to commemorate the hundredth birthday of the society, I have felt very near to the Relief Society leaders of the past and the faithful members who are the mothers, the grandmothers, and even greatgrandmothers of the members today. They have stepped out alive to me from the pages of the Woman's Exponent, and from the minutes of the general board. Their testimonies have increased my testimony. I have shared in their joys and sorrows. Narrator: And when you look at the portraits of our Relief Society leaders of the past, you know what Sister Sharp means. You see a solidarity of purpose shining in their eyes. You sense their courage and their faith. And it is a thrill to know that in the building of which we THE SYMBOL OF A DREAM 91 speak, they, too, will be personalities. We do not leave them behind; we take them with us; and we are greater because of them. They dreamed this building along with us, and it will be theirs, too—a building great because its purposes are great—because it will bear the name of a society whose purpose it is to serve the people, to comfort the sorrowful, to minister to the sick and the dying, to clothe the naked, and to soothe the distressed; to serve human need wherever it exists, as it will ever exist. And in this we can do no better than to beseech the Father that he give us charity and the pure love of Chnist. VOICE (Echoing... Resonant) Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock (Matt. 7:24-25). Narrator: Our building has not yet been erected, but our prayer is that we, and the sisters who have gone before us, have succeeded in laying for it, the foundation our Lord would have us lay—a foundation of true charity unto his people. [Lighting of foundation of building.] Charity never faileth!

A young Hindu girl, with an artistic and radiant personality, Miss Ray was sent abroad by her government to master all possible phases of physical education. She has a diploma in physical education and two degrees, bachelor of arts and bachelor of teaching, from her own country. After attending the University of Toronto, in Canada, she came to the University of Utah, where she will receive a master's degree in physical education in March. After visiting other universities, she will go to the Scandinavian countries for special study.

Upon her return to India she will have charge of all the physical education for women in her native province of Bengal. N ancient India the seclusion of women was unknown.

Page 99 C-—> EDITORIAL 9 VOL. 36 FEBRUARY 1949 Remembrance for ei \"The history of the world is but the biography of great men.\"—Carlyle INCE earliest times the world has been enriched by men and women who have lived their earthly days so well that their words and their deeds have been treasured down the years, illumined on the pages of time. The month of February brings to us, among many others who have contributed much to the wisdom and the beauty of the world, the anniversaries of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln whose names are household words throughout the land and whose deeds are written for long remembrance. In our uncertain days, with their problems and perplexities, it is strange to think that Washington, who lived his entire life on the eastern seaboard, yet realized the destiny of his country. He never saw the Mississippi River nor the skyward peaks of the Rocky Mountains. He could not have known the far expansion of his dream either in breadth of territory or in the development of political ideals. Yet he lived a life and left a philosohpy that have immeasurably guided the direction of the Republic. \"Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest may repair,\" George Washington advised the Constitutional Convention in the year 1787. In his Farewell Address nearly ten years later, he said: \"Of Page 100 all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.\" It is a deep thought to try to evaluuate even now the place which Lincoln achieved in the annals of our Nation and in the records of the world. He lived much of his adult life in the prairie country of the Middle West. During his time many pioneer trains, including the vanguard of the Latter-day Saints, began the lonely trek to the mysterious West. But Lincoln never saw the great deserts, the snow-clad Sierras, or the sea waves on the Pacific Coast. He could not have known the strength that would come to the Nation nor the problems of world leadership which would be thrust upon it, but he did know the good way of life; he understood lasting moral principles. Now his name is known to every school child in America and the echo of it has reached beyond our land. The words which the poet Edgar Lee Masters gave to Ann Rutledge might also apply to Lincoln: Bloom forever, O Republic, From the dust of my bosom It has been said of Lincoln that he stood erect by bending over the fallen, that he rose by lifting others.",

    "content": "Women Against Polio Elaine Whitelaw Director of Women's Activities National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis AST summer's widespread epidemics of infantile paralysis emphasized anew the importance of women in all aspects of polio work. Women always have been leaders in the fight against this disease. Naturally this would be so, since the vast majority of those hit by polio are children, and nothing comes closer to a woman's heart than the well-being of her children —indeed, of all children. But their activities today go further than sympathy and interest. Women are serving in the ranks of those caring for patients, seeking a preventive or cure, organizing communities to meet the needs of epidemic emergencies, and disseminating factual information about infantile paralysis to prevent fear itself from becoming epidemic. Nothing stood out more clearly during 1948, when at least 30,000 new cases of polio were reported for the United States, than the growing influence of women in this work.... Every successful _ volunteer movement owes a substantial part of its development to the tireless energy and enthusiasm of its unpaid women workers. And 1948 proved this to a high degree. More than 12,000 Polio Emergency Volunteers had been trained by them to assist professionals in the bedside care of polio patients in hospitals and homes Many went into polio wards in California, Nebraska, and Texas to help. At Camp Sutton, Page 102 Monroe, N. C., fifty PEVs did all of the non-professional work, so that physical therapists there could devote all their time to muscle training and testing. One of the most serious problems after an epidemic is the follow-up care of patients. Women will play a large part in solving this in North Carolina, for they have arranged to transport patients to hospital outpatient departments and travelling orthopedic clinics run by the State's Crippled Children's Service for regular check-ups and treatments. Many of the country's \"forgotten\" polio cases of years past already have been given new chances for useful lives— through the efforts of women volunteers who have systematically sought them out for check-ups. CREDIT for increased knowledge of facts about polio and a consequent decrease in panic, so noticeable in 1948, can be placed largely at the door of women's clubs and organizations which have made the public education program of the National Foundation part of the fabric of their health and welfare activities. Women have been outstanding, too, in the National Foundation's research and professional education programs. When Dr. Isabel M. Morgan of Johns Hopkins University reported last July at the First International Poliomyelitis Conference in New York on the successful immunization of monkeys WOMEN AGAINST POLIO against polio, she brought pride to women everywhere. Mrs. Morgan's work, with that of her colleagues, Drs. Howe and Bodian, has shed light on the role of antibodies in protection against the polio virus. While no preventive vaccine can be produced for trials in human beings until all types of polio viruses have been found, classified, and characterized—a project scheduled for the next year's work by several National Foundation supported laboratories— it is believed the Johns Hopkins experiments have provided necessary tools for an ultimate answer to protection of man from attacks of this disease. Of the dozen fields in which fellowships and _ scholarships have been awarded with March of Dimes funds, two-thirds have included women workers The fight against infantile paralySis is a joint activity of both women and men We face three factors that make the 1949 March of Dimes a crucial undertaking: 1. There are more polio patients than ever before. Some of the increase in recent years' totals of reported cases may be due to greater knowledge of 103 polio, prompter hospitalization and better care reporting. Whatever the reason, the rise in actual cases requiring assistance is real. 2. The cost of polio care has risen. Additional professional experts are required for modern care. Medical teams are developing, including, besides the physician and the nurse, the pediatrician, orthopedist, physical therapist, medical social worker, and phychological consultant. | More complete service to patients is possible. 3. The dollar does not go as far as it used to. Hospital costs have risen 10 to 12% since 1947, while the '1948 March of Dimes drive raised less than 4% more than in 1947. March of Dimes money cannot buy as much service, food, supplies, and equipment as in the past. To do the best job of taking care of polio patients, without slowing the now promising search for a solution to the disease or interfering with the training of urgently-needed hospital specialists and research workers, men and women—together —must make the 1949 March of Dimes the most successful in twelve years. The conquest of polio, lying somewhere in the years ahead, can only be achieved by such determined and energetic partnership. — Winter Pear Dorothy J. Roberts What loveliness was felled with this brave tree To leave returning robins fugitive; What grace crashed earthward, what lost melody From branches where a meadow lark would sieve Through a silver throat, the fountain of his song. Upon these boughs each season's beauty lay, In slumber pale, but straight of trunk and strong; Ephemeral in spring's samite array, Here summer lacked no leaf to cool her shade, And autumn burned a riotous color chart. When, after its bright zenith, leaves were grayed, Still amber and vermilion lit the heart, Seeing the winter fruit no limb had lost, Awaiting final favor from the frost. Joanna Margery S. Stewart CHAPTER 2 Synopsis: Joanna, who had married David Niels against the wishes of her family, is left a widow with four children to care for and support. Courageously, she takes inventory of her resources—a home, poorly furnished and not paid for, and $1.19 in cash. OMEONE knocked at the S front door. The children, like a covey of quail, went with her to answer it. It was the neighbor who had built the fire for his children. He was carrying a stuffed flour sack, which he swung down from his shoulders. \"It's navy beans. Got a cousin who brought me down a couple of sacks of 'em. He grows 'em. Thought you could use 'em, maybe.\" Joanna smiled at his flushed, young face. \"Thank you. I surely could.\" He went ahead of her to the kitchen. \"Tell me where to put 'em. Don't want to mess your clean house. Behind the stove do?\" Joanna nodded. She moved a chair to make room. He cleared his throat. He was young and ruggedly built. Color tan up into his neck. \"Anything I can do, Mis' Niels?\" Joanna shook her head. \"You're right kind to ask, though.\" When he had gone the children climbed back in their places and resumed their meal. Penny stared at the sack. \"I guess we'll get a thousand suppers out of it.\" David rubbed his stomach. \"BosPage 104 ton-baked, with molasses... That's what Daddy liked.\" Penny buttered her bread. \"Daddy said nobody could make Bostonbaked like Mommy. Daddy said she was the best cook in the world.\" Joanna, standing by the stove, lifted her head. There was a sudden burning in her breast, a roaring in her ears, a breathless reaching for a spar. \"Say that again, Penny What your Daddy said... About my cooking.\" Penny nodded her head vigorously. \"He wasn't just kidding either. Every time you make Boston-baked the whole neighborhood walks by just to smell the delicious smell. Mrs. Smith says so. She told me.\" Hope leaped like flame. In Joanna. She opened the lid of the range and poured more coal into it. She opened the oven door and let the delicious heat surge into the kitchen. Michael's head was nodding. She went to her bedroom and brought out the rocker, sat in it, and held Michael against her. This was the hour David had loved. He had held them cradled in his laughter and his love. She searched her mind, but no story was hidden there. She reached out her arm and Sally cuddled against her. Joanna asked haltingly, \"Would you... Like to hear about when I was a little girl?\" They shouted their delight.

She had beautiful white hair that gave her an air of aristocracy, bringing to Joanna's mind the remembrance of powdered wigs and curtsies and billowing skirts. Her eyes were a bright sparkling brown, her skin was lined, but Joanna loved to look at her, finding her beautiful. Abigail Smith was puffing. \"I came through the back way, leaning under that fence always gets me. But I couldn't hold back any longer. I been watching you since crack o' dawn.\" She eyed the oven door. \"What were you puttin' in that oven?\" \"Beans,\" Joanna said, laughter a pale ghost in her voice, as she watched her visitor's astonished eyes go from covered dish to cake pan, to half-eaten pie. \"It's not for us. Folks brought us enough to last the week.\" Abigail Smith unwrapped her hands from her apron and came to stand before the range. \"\"Then who for? What you making a batch o beans that size for?\" Joanna measured oatmeal into the boiling water. She avoided her neighbor's eye. \"I had a thought... Maybe I could sell them. Folks say they never tasted Boston-baked like mine.\" \"You're the best cook in this ward!\" Abigail averred, \"Everybody's crazy about your cooking.\" \"Tt's all I know,\" Joanna said. \"Tt it just has to work.\" Abigail opened the oven door. And sniffed appreciatively. \"Well, maybe you can do it. How do you plan to go about it?\" Joanna, setting the table, stumbled out her ideas. Bornly. Abigail shook her head. \"Maybe you can do it. But, this depression, nobody's making out. Maybe you Should better have saved your beans.\" \"T've got to try it,\" Joanna cried. \"T just can't sit and do nothing.\" \"You can go on relief, like the rest of us.\" \"No.\" Joanna's mouth set stub- \"No.\" Abigail rolled her hands in her apron. \"Well, maybe if I had children, I'd feel like you do. Children make a difference.\" After a moment's silence, she added: \"I'm nght proud of you. Leastways you'll go down fighting.\" Joanna smiled crookedly, \"But you think I'll go down.\" Abigail turned to the door. \"Listen, I have to go now. Henry will be getting up in a minute, but there's no call for you to drag things around in little David's wagon. I'll drive you around in that old Model T' of ours. Youll be able to carry more.\" Joanna's face flushed in gratitude. \"That's nice, right nice of you.\" Her hand on the door, Abigail paused. \"Why don't you make up a batch of your good bread? I'll bake it in my oven. It's got heat in it going to waste. People ought to like that bread of yours.\" Joanna stirred the oatmeal impatiently. \"Tl do that.\" \"You just come any time If I get done with my work I'll come over and help. What do you plan to carry the beans in?\" Joanna looked wildly about the kitchen. \"I never thought of that.\" Abigail's smile was smug. \"T thought of something myself, just standing here, I thought, now why wonderful,\" \"Smarter than a lot of folks give Me credit for.

She pulled on stockings, slipped into her good shoes, and stared at herself in the mirror. Her hair! She brushed it behind her ears and forced the short ends into a roll. She stared at herself. Her eyes looked too large and brilliant and anxious. Her mouth was pale. She fumbled for a lipstick, applied it hastily, and rushed back to the kitchen. She called Michael and Sally, got them in and out of the bathroom, and then, with Abigail's help, carried the basket to the back seat of the Car, The fear within her grew larger with every block that brought them nearer to town. All right, she thought, I'm afraid. But I can't let that stop me. I can't Just quit with all the food I've made. I've got to go ahead with it. I've got to try. What more can folks do than say \"no?\" I've been said \"no,\" to, lots of times. She looked back at Michael and Sally jolting in the back seat, babbling their delight over the ride and the sights. They have no one but me. It just has to go. But when at last Abigail found a parking place before the building that housed the railroad office, Joanna could hardly force her legs out of the car. Abigail was nervous, too. \"Now don't feel bad if they don't buy. I'll take good care of the youngsters.\" Joanna nodded. She lifted jars of beans, loaves of brown and white bread into a picnic basket that already held the paper plates and napkins and spoons that had taken ninety cents of her small hoard. She covered them all with a white linen napkin, and straightened and looked at Abigail. \"I'll make out,\" she said through dry lips. \"I'll make out fine.\" \"It's just five minutes to twelve. You'll catch them at a good time.\" Joanna crossed the sidewalk to the door. The prayer within her had so loud a cry, she wondered that the passersby did not pause to hear please help me. You know I can't do anything without you. You know I'm nothing but a farm gitl, not brought up to do anything but cook and bake. You know about my children.

She waited until they were safely gone before she put on her brown coat and walked aimlesslly towards town. Stopping before the big house of red brick, she peered over the hedge into the living room. There was a side window with a lifted shade. Yes, it was Miss Ardman, still in her brown school dress. She had her hair down in a long bob, looking very young, not like a school teacher at all. She sat there, neither reading nor sewing. When Janie rang the doorbell, Miss Ardman came, her eyes red, as if she had been crying.; \"You didn't stay home from the dance because I spoiled things by wearing your dress?\" Janie blurted out the words, her voice thick. When they were out she leaned against the door jamb, trembling with relief that she had said them. Miss Ardman pulled her inside the door. \"No,\" she said. \"\"That's not the reason, although when I first saw you come into the dance, I felt like doing just that.\" — began to cry. \"I didn't mean to break my promise,\" she said between sobs. \"TI felt like I had to wear that dress to the dance or I would die. I guess there's no use telling you how sorry and ashamed I am.\" \"That's the best thing you can do,\" Miss Ardman told her, wiping Janie's eyes and nose with her own handkerchief. She drew Janie into the living room and sat beside her on the couch.. The tension of the past week cbbed from Janic. \"When I looked out there and saw you,\" she confessed, \"I knew what a low thing I had done. You could have shamed me there before everyone and made me hate myself and you. But you didn't. You acted as if you were proud I'd worn your dress.\" \"I had a lot of confidence in you, Jamie. I knew you would tell me about it.\" The coldness and hardness were gone from Jamie's body, leaving it light and relaxed. Her tears came again, not the wrenching sobs, but easy ones. \"'Don't stop me,' she protested. \"I'm so happy.\" She felt clean and good. \"I wanted to come to you but I didn't have the courage.\" \"You came at the nght time,\" her teacher told her. \"I was in a low state myself. 'This afternoon when I came home to curl my hair and rest, I got a telephone call from Robert's landlady. She said he had the flu, but that he had been planning to come right up until this afternoon when she put him to bed.\" She smiled ruefully at Janie. \"For awhile I almost thought he wasn't ill. I was so disappointed.\" The barrier between student and teacher was gone. \"Why,\" Janie cried, shocked into speech, \"teachers are human, just like anyone else!\" She laughed with Miss Ardman. Clasping her hands over her knees, she confided, \"I wanted to go to this dance so bad my skin hurt. But I wasn't going with Don Betger and no one else asked me.\" Avoiding Miss Ardman's surprisdd look, she said, \"After I wore the dress I knew I could never go with him again.\" \"Then the week of misery was worth it,\" Miss Ardman said gently. \"You can do better things than go with Don.\" THE DRESS Janie's stifled yearnings and resentments stirred within her. \"I want to do better things, but I don't know how.\" She looked down at her hands while Miss Ardman stared at the carpet. Suddenly she jumped up, facing Janie. \"There's just one thing for you to do,\" she said with determination. Everything had been hopeless for so long, Janie felt none of her teachers enthusiasm. \"What is it?\" she asked, not moving. Miss Ardman became a school teacher again. \"Ordinarily,\" she said in her clear, precise voice, \"I don't think that a college education is the sum total of life. People can be just as happy, just as useful—that is, some people. But for you, Janie, I think it is the quickest and. Best way.\" Janie slumped against the sofa. \"T've got about as much chance of going to college as you have of being queen of England,\" she said. Miss Ardman's eyes were bright with zeal. She sat by Janie's side, her voice as sharp as a new blade. \"Td like to know why you can't go to college. No,\" she commanded, lifting her hand. \"Don't tell me! I know all the answers you have and there isn't one that's valid! All I want to know is, does it mean enough to you to go?\" \"Of course I want to go, but how can a girl like me do it?\" \"That's the whole trouble, a girl like you!\" Miss Ardman snapped off each word and thrust it scornfully at Janie. \"\"What's wrong with a girl like you? You feel sorry for yourself. It isn't because you are poor. It's because you think you are. 113 That's what's holding you back! Don't you know, Janie,\" she ejaculated, \"poverty is no disgrace! It's just an inconvenience. All we have to do is get rid of the inconvenience.\". \"I know,\" Janie acknowledged. \"T ought to get away from Ronsville long enough to show people I can do something. Here I'm just Janie Carlson in an old brown coat.\" \"That's why college is. The best way for you. It will polish those rough edges and open the way to a new life—for you and for your family.\" Miss Ardman was on her feet now, pulling Janie with her. \"It's easy, really,\" she said as they went upstairs. Inside her room she pulled out a last year's blue linen dress. Obediently Janie put it on and sat in front of the mirror while Miss Ardman arranged her hair. \"Now smile,\" Miss Ardman said, \"as if you expected people to like you.\" \"Could I be like that always?\" Janie asked as the two girls watched her face in the mirror. ISS Ardman had an answer. \"I have friends who would be downright glad to have you live with them. You could help with the dishes and stay with the children when necessary. On Saturdays and Sundays they would pay you extra to give you spending money. I'll write tomorrow, but I know we can call it settled.\" \"There's tuition and books,\" Janie reminded her. \"Let me think,\" Miss Ardman replied, tightening her lips. \"I believe we can manage that too. There are scholarships to help girls like you. If we go about it the right way, I'm 114 sure we can get one. All you need now is money for clothes.\" She gave Janie's cheek a triumphant pat. \"I do baby sitting, but it doesn't pay much in Ronsville. People have too many relatives.\" \"A pretty girl like you,' Miss Ardman deliberated, a critical look in her eyes, \"shouldn't have trouble getting higher paid work.\" She gave Janie a thorough inspection from her curling bob to her pumps with the run-over heels. Her mouth still tight, she went into her closet again and emerged with a pair of saddle leather sandals, almost new and a fleecy white jacket, slightly worn at the cuffs, but personable. \"Now we'll go to the drugstore,\" She decided. \"Ernie Todd owes me something for all the money I've spent there when I've been lonely for home. He told me he was going to put a new girl at the fountain as soon as the tourist",

    "content": "The Spirit of the Gospel, the Soul of Relief Society President Belle S. Spafford General President of Relief Society (Delivered at the afternoon session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, Thursday, September 30, 1948.) ARCH 17, 1842 in the Lodge Room over the Joseph Smith store, the Phophet Joseph Smith uttered words of lasting import to Latter-day Saint women when he said: \"I now declare this society organized, with president and counselors, according to parliamentary usages.\" Addressing the eighteen women present on that memorable occasion, Elder John Taylor said that he \"rejoiced to see this institution organized according to the law of heaven and to see all things moving forward in such a glorious manner.\" He prayed that \"the blessings of heaven might rest upon this institution henceforth.\" Today, 106 years since Elder 'Taylor so spoke, tens of thousands of women rejoice that this society was organized. They see it moving forward in a glorious manner. Grateful for the heritage of the past, faithfully and devotedly meeting the assignments of the present, sagaciously planning and building for the future, they acknowledge that the blessings of heaven do indeed rest upon this society. There is within this society a great life-giving element—a spirit which reaches out to women from the eastern shores to the western shores of our own great country, into Mexico Page 148 and on south to the Latin lands of South America; it reaches into remote villages of Alaska and Canada; it extends into the continents of Europe and Asia, to South Africa and the islands of the sea, binding together women of all nationalities into a great sisterhood, unifying them in purpose and impelling them on to worthy accomplishment. This life-giving spirit is the spirit of the gospel; it is this which makes Relief Society different from other women's organizations the world over. It is this that gives to Relief Society its strength as well as its heart and soul. The spirit of the gospel, operating in the lives of Relief Society women, causes them to reach out for immortal treasures, to be not satisfied with values of passing worth; it leads them into experiences that bring real and enduring joy; it subdues selfishness within them and crowds out the spirit of criticism and faultfinding; it dissipates fear and builds confidence; it engenders within them a recognition of and a respect for an inspired Church leadership and bids them to render obedience to that leadership—not a reluctant, obligatory obedience, but a free, voluntary obedience actuated by love; it lifts them above the mean and petty things in life into the realm of that which is of good report and THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL, THE SOUL OF RELIEF SOCIETY praiseworthy; it enables them to live useful, happy lives. It was the spirit of the gospel operating in the life of Eliza R. Snow that caused her to travel the weary path across the plains bearing with her the sacred book of records —the first minutes of our beloved Relief Society, containing instructions from our inspired Prophet which for more than a century have guided the society. It was the spirit of the gospel within her that decreed that she should go from door to door canvassing for students, who, according to the records, must be \"possessed of nerve, energy, and ambition\" to attend a school of medicine and surgery \"for the instruction of females\" in order that the medical and health needs of an isolated pioneering community might be met. T was the spirit of the gospel alive in the heart of Zina D. H. Young that caused her to accept, without thought of dissenting, a mission to lead the Relief Societies of the Church in a new and untried venture—the production of silk \"that the sisters might do all in their power to clothe themselves and their families, and that home industry might be promoted.\" It was the spirit of the gospel active in the soul of Aunt Em that gave her the courage to lead the sisters in their strange mission of saving grain. To say that these missions were accepted without feelings of trepidation would be to misrepresent truth. However, fear of failure was not its cause, for these sisters had faith in the inspired leadership of the Priesthood authorities who di- 149 rected them, and a courage born of testimony. These feelings were but the result of an intelligent sensitiveness to the magnitude of their tasks and all that was involved in their fulfillment. Aunt Em, when eighty-four years old, addressing the sisters in general conference on the grain-saving program, expressed her feelings in these words: \"I felt very timid and I was just about trembling when I went to talk the matter over with President Wells.\" (President Wells was counselor to President Brigham Young. ) Praiseworthy success crowned the efforts of these sisters in their varied undertakings. Today, a symbol of this success, there rise toward the heavens great elevators filled with grain as a result of the gamering in the fields by the sisters, who sold Sunday eggs, and quilts, rag carpets, and other products of their hands to earn funds with which to buy grain; disposed to do it because the spirit of the gospel bade them accept their missions and render loving obedience to Church leadership. This same spirit is active in the hearts of Relief Society women of this day. Only one year ago a Relief Society sister, president of a small branch of Mexican sisters, sat in this great Tabernacle and heard a plan proposed whereby the sisters of this day were to raise one-half million dollars for a Relief Society home. She, too, had feelings of trepidation because of the magnitude of the undertaking. But, strong in testimony, her response came: \"T don't know how we can do it. But the First Presidency has authorized it. If they authorize it, it is right. If it is nght, we can do it.\" 150 And do it they did. The response of this sister was typical of that of sisters all over the Church—sisters imbued with the spirit of the gospel. Anxious hours have been my own lot in the planning and conduct of this great fund-raising program, but doubt has not been mine. Secure in the approval of the First Presidency, mindful of the support always given the sisters in their righteous undertakings by the Priesthood authorities, fully aware of the faithfulness and devotion of the sisters of this day, having a strong inner conviction that the undertaking was nght, a deep-seated, calm assurance has been mine that success would ultimately attend our efforts. And the future will see a Relief Society home rise, a monument to the devotion of the sisters of this day—evidence that the spirit of the gospel has been with them. The spirit of the gospel will always exist within this Society in direct ratio to the strength of the testimonies of the women who make up its membership. A knowledge of the gospel, obedience to its teachings, a willingness to keep the commandments of God on the part of Relief Society women are prerequisites to their well-being as individuals and to the well-being of Relief Society as an organization. The Second Epistle of John, addressed to a woman, \"unto the elect lady,\" may appropriately be addressed to Relief Society women today: Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.... And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 we had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.... Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward (Second Epistle of John, verses 3, 5, 6, and 8). In the gospel of St. John we read this message of the Master to his children: If ye love me, keep my commandments. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him (John 14:15, 21, 23). The Lord will come unto Relief Society; he will make his abode with us, and the blessings of heaven will rest upon our beloved society so that -it will continue to move forward in a glorious manner if we who make up its membership will but love the Lord and keep his commandments. Our work will be accomplished with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance and we as individuals will receive the rewards of nghteousness— even peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come. I know that this gospel is true. This testimony sweeps over me at times with an almost startling reality. There is a Father to whom we may go in prayer and find comfort and sustenance, inspiration, and guidance. Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, chosen to bring to earth in this dispensation the gospel of Christ, the only plan by which we may live and gain exaltation in (Continued on page 209) Shird Prize Story Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest Compromise Mildred R. Stutz URIEL watched her daughM ter Connie walk up the path toward the front door. Her books were tucked under her arm, her saddle Oxfords scuffed the wet pavement slightly. Her blonde head was stiffly erect and she gave no indication that she was aware of the girls walking down the sidewalk behind her. Muriel sighed and turned from the rain-drenched window. There was no sense in letting Connie know that her lonesomeness was not a secret. The door opened and Connie came in. \"Hello, Mother,\" she said, \"mmmmm, something smells good—baked ham?\" \"Yes, orders from the boss. Is it still raining?\" \"Cats and dogs,' Connie answered. She tossed her books on a chair and walked into the dining oom with her mother. The table was set for twelve. Gleaming linen, silver, and crystal were accentuated by a centerpiece of early spring flowers. Muriel looked at the table with satisfaction. \"Dinner party?\" Connie asked. \"Yes, prospective customers. Loads of money.\" Muriel felt a stab of uneasiness—almost like guilt. It had been lingering inside her all day as she had gone about preparing for the dinner party. \"Don't look so worried, Mother MILDRED R. STUTZ dear,' Connie said flippantly, \"] promise not to drink out of my saucer. In fact, if you don't mind, I think I'll take in a movie.

These people wouldn't be interesting to you anyway.\" A wave of relief washed over Muriel, followed by the guilt again. \"If there isn't anything I can do to help you, I think I'll study for awhile.\" Page 151 152 \"Go ahead, Connie. Mrs. Keller is here to help in the kitchen and do the serving. I don't think there's anything you can do.\" Connie walked slowly up the stairs. Watching her go, Muriel's heart ached for her. It wasn't right that a young girl should be so alone. Why couldn't she adjust to the new town? 'True, it held little resemblance to the town she had grown up in, but Connie was sixteen, and, surely, she was old enough to trealize that nothing stayed the same forever. Lakeside had been such a peaceful, quiet, little place. Looking back on it now, it seemed almost dull. Everybody knew everybody: else. They went to Church on Sunday, did their laundry on Monday, and chatted over the back fence as they hung the clothes to dry. They visited in the grocery store and compared price lists and grocery bills. Scottsville was different. There was so much to be done. The big old house had been completely redecorated. John's office had changed from empty storerooms to an attractive suite. His business was building up fast and they were meeting all the right people. [N her room, Connie stared moodily at the rain sliding down the window pane. There was really no reason why she should study tonight. She was already far ahead of the rest of the class. She made a few doodles on the flyleaf of her notebook, walked to the window, back to the dressing table, and finally back to her books. She might as well study, there was nothing else to do. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 Muriel moved from kitchen to dining room, giving efficient instructions to Mrs. Keller and attending to details that required her skilled touch. It was going to be a lovely party. The guests were, for the most part, strangers to her. They were people who had great influence both socially and financially. They could mean a lot to the business. Muriel had been to enough dinner parties in Scottsville to know how vastly they differed from the parties at Lakeside. They had a sophistication about them that did not come easily for Muriel. She had been born in a religious family and had grown up in a religious town. The moral values taught her from childhood had never been questioned, and she had passed the same teachings on to her daughter. It was John who had first felt the bonds of their provincialism. In his business he came in contact with many people. They were people more worldly and less hampered with moral laws than he was used to dealing with; but they had money and influence, and John's business needed both. Muriel opened the refrigerator and tried to ignore the unfamiliar bottles inside. She shifted them about and was irked that the guilty feeling still persisted. She turned to see Connie coming in the door. She was angry with herself for quickly closing the door, so she busied herself about the kitchen to conceal her annoyance. \"How about a handout, Mother, I'm starved?\" Connie sliced some bread and buttered it. She pulled some leaves from some lettuce, folded them between the bread, and COMPROMISE viewed the sandwich appraisingly. 'Some mayonnaise and a pickle, and I'll have a piece of art,\" she laughed. Muriel felt a strange prickling on the back of her neck as she saw her daughter cross the room and open the refrigerator door. Connie gave a low whistle and exclaimed, puzzled, \"For Pete sake, what's this? A brewery?\", Muriel tried to sound nonchalant. \"People around here are different than they were at Lakeside. 'They don't have the same—ideologies.\" \"Yes,\" said Connie, her brown eyes troubled. \"I've noticed a difference among the kids at school. They don't act the way I do.\" Muriel hurried on, uncomfortable, \"The contacts your father makes here tonight are very important. These people can mean a lot to the business. We've got to make them like us—we've got to go halfway.\" Muriel knew her explanation sounded weak. The thought occurred to her that she was explaining to herself as much as to Connie. She wondered if the explanation was as unsatisfactory. CONN IE ate her snack in silence, and Muriel, unable to feel at ease, excused herself to go dress. It was nearly time for the first picture at the Embassy, so Connie took her raincoat and umbrella from the hall closet and, calling a quick goodbye to her mother, stepped out into the early spring evening. Raindrops splashed in the puddles along the sidewalk, making the reflected street lights dance crazily. The steady drumming of the rain on her umbrella was comforting to Connie—comforting and yet a lonesome sound, She walked slowly, counting 153 the squares in the sidewalk, watching people move about behind lightly curtained windows. A very noisy jalopy clattered down the street. Connie recognized a number of students she had seen about the campus. The movie was dull. Connie sat through one feature and then, because it was still too early to go home, stayed for a cartoon and newsreel. It was still raining as she left the theater and hurried down the sidewalk toward the drugstore. She was about to enter when a gitl's voice called, \"Hey, Connie, come here.\" Turning slowly, she saw the old battered jalopy parked at the curb. She hesitated a moment and then approached the car. She didn't know the girl who called to her, but it was nice having someone know her name. \"Climb in, Connie, we'll take you home.\" The driver of the car was a large, dark fellow Connie had seen at school. He had always seemed friendly even though he appeared somewhat older than most of the students. \"No, thanks, I think I'll walk—it isn't far.\" \"Aw, come on, Connie,\" someone said, \"there's plenty of room.\" The car door opened and Connie saw five or six boys and girls inside. Some of them looked familiar, others were strangers, but they were all laughing and joking and urging her to join them. It was warm inside and the rain danced merrily against the tin top, and everyone seemed to be having fun. Connie smiled uncertainly, \"All tight,\" she said and stepped inside. There was a faint odor of tobacco 154 smoke and some unfamiliar smell she couldn't identify. In the back seat the boys and girls shifted about to make room for her. She felt herself pulled down onto someone's lap, and arms held her firmly. The car jerked to a start. HEY careened down the wet streets and stopped in front of Connie's home. The lights were burning brightly and strange cars were parked in the driveway. \"You don't have to go in yet do you, Connie?\" they kept asking, \"4t's only a little after ten-thirty.\" \"T'm supposed to be in before eleven,\" she said. '\"\"Won't your old man let you stay out later than that?\" Connie tried to be as gay as they were, \"Oh, I'd better check in,\" she said. \"Look, Connie, why don't we all drive out to Traveler's Inn and have a snack or something. We'll bring you right back and you'll be in before midnight easy.\" They were all coaxing. They acted like they really wanted her to go. \"Traveler's Inn,\" she asked, \"where's that?\" There was a slight pause. \"Oh, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 it's a little place just outside the city limits—not very far.\" Someone giggled and the arm around Connie tightened slightly. \"TH tell you what I'll do,\" she said, \"I'll run in and tell Mother and Dad where I'm going, and if they say it's all right, I'll be back.\" She ran lightly up the walk. It was fun having friends again. The uneasiness she had felt when she first entered the car was slipping away, and now the invitation to Traveler's Inn, whatever that was, sounded full of fun and excitement. If only the folks would let her go. Of course, it was late and she hardly knew the crowd she was going with, but—well—maybe they'd let her go. She followed the sound of voices down the hall to the living room. Through the glass-paneled doors she could see her parents and their guests. 'They were seated comfortably about the room. Connie could tell that her father was making what he called the \"right contacts.\" Her mother was serving a drink of some kind to a big, bloated man who lolled awkwardly against the mantle. The room was clouded with smoke. Connie turned slowly and stood in the shadows of the hall. For a (Continued on page 213) Craig, Tommy, and Lanny. Biology at Snow Junior College.

I looked carefully around gallery 32 of the Chicago Art Institute, then consulted the catalog I had _purchased on my last visit, two: years earlier. It should have been there, it was so listed, \"Breton's 'Song of the Lark' in gallery 32, Modern French Artists.\" But there was no painting of a peasant girl, with sickle, bare feet, and snooded hair. I approached a guard, pacing slowly from room to room. 'That his occupation was just a job was evident in his attitude. He was bored with his inactivity, irked at the often inane questions of tourists. \"I do not find Breton's 'Song of the Lark,'\" I said. \"Has it been moved to some other gallery?\" The guard did not slacken his measured steps, nor unfold his arms, nor even look at me. \"It's out on loan tour,\" he answered over his shoulder, as he walked toward another room. Out on loan tour. Those four words cut into my consciousness like a whip. It couldn't be. I had brought our two children from Utah to Chicago to give them fine cultural contacts. To me this picture was the epitome of artistic achievement. We would go to New York. They would see Bonheur's \"Horse Fair\"; \"The Hand of God,\" by Rodin; and Cleopatra's Needle. Crowds, elevated trains, subways, Wall Street, Ellis Island—all would provide new vistas for impressionable youth. But I wanted my son and daughter to see \"The Song of Page 156 the Lark.\" Some critics maintain the girl's smile is more inspiring than the famed one of Mona Lisa. \"Oh!\" I cried out. In my disappointment I was the outspoken westerner. But there was no one to share my disappointment, for I had come alone to locate the best exhibits, while the children watched some tennis matches. \"Oh!\" I repeated. \"Why, I brought two children fifteen hundred miles to see that picture!' I spoke to the disappearing back of the bored guard. He was methodically pacing into the next room. Pictures were just pictures to him. My quandary was not his concem. I stood baffled, staring at the spot where the picture should have been. What should I tell the children? 'Their interest was spurred and fed by my enthusiasm. Only too well I knew they would find other diversions. My daughter wanted to attend a shoe sale at Marshall Fields; my son hoped to see a sparring match between a jewfish and a shark in the Shedd Aquarium. A gentle voice at my elbow brought me back to reality. \"Pardon me, Madam.\" The low, modulated voice was like the first trickling from thawing spring snows back home. \"I heard what you said to the guard. The picture is not loaned. It is in retirement. You see, the Institute owns so many thousands of famous canvases, we sox a Institute of; Chicago THE SONG OF THE LARK From a Painting by Jules Adolphe Breton Page 157 158 have to rotate them. But fifteen hundred miles is a long distance, and your children must not be disappointed. I shall personally conduct them to the storage gallery. Shall we say, tomorrow, at ten?\" I looked into the smiling face of a man so delicately molded, it seemed he had stepped down from one of the decorative pieces of priceless china. His thin, transparent hands, his small figure, his disarming smile, all bespoke the connoisseur. Back in the hotel, I schooled the children all evening, so they would be appreciative of this unusual service. I borrowed a book on French art from the hotel library; we studied a good reproduction of the original we were about to see; learned the highlights of Breton's career. \"The shoe sale will be over by the time we can get there,\" protested my daughter. \"I did so want a pair of those open-toed, patent leather, French heels. 'There isn't a store in our State that carries the style I want. What's an old picture, anyway?\" Promptly at ten the next morning we reported to the little man at his desk in gallery 32. His hands seemed more transparent when grasped by my towering son. We went along hallways, where uniformed guards touched their caps, as they unlocked gates for us. The little man explained everything. The Institute buildings were fireproof, burglarproof, even earthquake-proof. Down elevators, along more hallways. Always the guards touched their caps, always locked gates were opened to us. Finally RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 we came to the aisle marked \"French: igth century.\" At a signal from our guide, a guard unlocked the final gate, and we were ushered into an_ air-cooled, tomblike room, lined with rows upon rows of portable racks. \"Breton,\" spoke our guide, and a button was pushed. A rack rolled out. Another button, and the large canvas of \"The Song of the Lark\" stood out alone. It was illumined. I was suddenly happy, for both children were awed. There stood the peasant girl, with her coarse garments, her huge, hardened bare feet; the strength of her sickle hand plainly revealed. The lark was soaring from its nesting place in the brown furrow; with a song on her own lips, the girl watched its ascent. Health was evident in every line of her body, as though born of the green meadow and the brown earth of the field. The sun, just rising over the distant treetops, illumined her face. From her snooded hair to her feet she revealed contentment and peace. The green meadow, the freshly plowed furrows, the azure sky, all climaxed her inexplicable smile.. HE children studied the picture and listened to a half-hour discourse on the works of Breton, artist and poet. As they studied the picture, I studied its effect upon them. My faith was vindicated. The delicate voice of our guide recited some of Breton's poetry. Born a French peasant, Breton had lived in the deep poverty of the downtrodden poor. He had experienced the revolution of 1848. He excelled in depicting the despair of the country folk. A painter of rustic life, a THE SONG OF THE LARK man of the poor. The peasants of his day were fortunate to have sabots for Sunday wear. The school children of Chicago had voted this picture the most popular in the entire Institute. As we retraced our course, gates were locked behind us. Up elevators, along steel-barred halls, and finally out into the light of the galleries, we went. My son's demonstration of courtesy, his speech of thanks to our kindly guide, gave me added joy in being his mother. My adolescent daughter had a dreamy, faraway expression in her eyes. She looked at her trimly shod feet and whispered to me: \"All she ever had were wooden clogs.\" Our guide gave me his card, shook hands all around, and quickly left us. We sauntered through gallery after gallery. The children, rather than I, wanted to see more. The guard was doing his paces from room 159 to room. His arms were folded, his face bored. As we stood on the front steps of the Institute, flanked by the guarding lions, I glanced at my watch. \"We still have time to get to Marshall Fields,\" I said to my daughter. \"Perhaps you can yet find what you want in shoes. And I feel sure the Shedd Aquarium will be open this afternoon.\" She glanced at her sensible, durable, walking oxfords. \"These are good enough,\" she smiled. \"I guess French heels would be hard to walk in\" \"What's a couple of sparring fish?\" countered my son. \"Heigh,\" he queried, \"who was that little man, anyway? What's his name?\" I held the card in my palm, and all three of us looked at the printing. Our guide had been an assistant curator of the Chicago Art Institute.

Anne Henderson shifted a trifle in her seat and he smiled down into her clear, gray eyes. \"Remind me to put in a driveway without that bump,\" he said, and Anne laughed. Mark eyed her small face, the wistful mouth, and there was hunger in his eyes. Annie, Annie, he thought, will it really come true this time—our matrlage—or As if sensing his thought, Anne held up her lips and he bent his dark head to kiss her. She moved against his shoulder. \"Oh, Mark, I can't wait. Our very own house. If only it would be finished and we could move in right after we're married.\" Mark grinned. \"One month? That would take some doing.\" Both turned as with one accord and looked back. '\"'Can't you almost see the wide window and how it will bring that whole view right into the living room?\" Mark gestured toward a line of blue hills against whose background maples and red oaks flamed in autumn colors. \"Or,\" he eyed her in mock anxiety, \"are you going to be the kind of wife who hangs drapes all over windows?\" Anne shook her head, smiling. \"Not that window at any rate.\" She gave a little sigh and relaxed in the seat beside him. \"It's almost real, isn't it?\" she asked, pointing to where careful lines of brown and red Page 160 leaves had been raked to form the outlines of a house plan. She laughed suddenly and tossed the hair from her eyes, pulling her green coat around her. \"Mother and Dad would think us a little goofy if they'd seen us building a house out of leaves as children do.\" Mark held himself in check, straightening the slight stoop that had lately come to his shoulders. By long practice he had been able to achieve a_ Satisfactory demeanor when Anne's parents were mentioned. But how could he think of them as anything but enemies to their marriage? \"We'll build our house of wood, mortar, and bricks, my sweet, like the wise little pig,\" he said, \"and no big, bad wolf can huff and puff it down, as children say. But seriously, Anne, I'm telling Anderson tomorrow that we'll take this lot. And then I'll get Barnhoff at the plans.\" He flicked on the switch and stepped on the starter. Anne turned to look back again. \"It will be just like the leaf-house, won't it?\" she asked anxiously. \"You remember how it's to be?\" \"Every last detail, from the big window and the view to the service porch and the clothes reel,' he laughed. He took his hat from the seat back, tilting it confidently over his short, black hair. \"Now let's go back.\" HEY rode in the silence of long friendship, back through the streets of Hanford where they'd both been reared. A haze of blue, bom THE HOUSE OF LEAVES of many bonfires, hung over the streets. He breathed deeply of the spicy fragrance, remembering so many autumns. Five years, he thought, and silently cursed himself that they had not married before, regardless. He turned and looked at Anne, seeing as if for the first time the wide, gray eyes almost too large for her small face, the auburn hair curled around her ears but smoothed into a page boy at the back of her neck, the tiny mole on her chin. Anne, sweet, he thought, remembering how he'd wanted her every hour of the five years. Maybe this time, there'd be not one thing to stand in the way. Not her father and mother, not Josie. \"Did you ever wonder, Anne, what it would have been like if we'd married when we first planned?\" he asked suddenly. Anne shook her head. \"Who knows? Anyway, we couldn't have. Mother and Dad wouldn't hear of it. I was only nineteen.\" \"And now you're twenty-four and I'm twenty-seven. We'd have had all these years of being married, Anne.\" Anne turned a distressed face toward him. \"I know, Mark.\" \"Of course, the first two years, I had to get the drugstore on a paying basis again after Dad died,\" he said. \"Tt would have made hard sledding if we'd been married then, I realize.\"' \"Then Dad broke his leg,\" Anne said, \"and it wouldn't heal. And Mother got sick worrying about it. That was the third year.\" ~ \"Yes,\" Mark agreed slowly, and 'his mouth went dry remembering how pinched and white Anne had looked before her mother was up 161] and about again. \"Then, after that, Anne, Josie got married and your folks thought they couldn't lose both of you at once.\" \"But we did begin to plan then, Mark,\" she interrupted hurriedly. \"We were going to live in the flat over the store. We would have, too, if the folks hadn't decided to take that trip West.\" \"Yes, I know,\" Mark said. He wanted to add, \"And you had to go as chauffeur on account of your father's lame foot. And that was the fourth year.\" But he didn't say it. It would sound bitter, he decided. It was all past, anyway, unless something new arose. For Anne had promised. He straightened suddenly and stopped for the red light, turning his eyes to follow a sudden gesture from Anne. \"Look, Mark. In that car. It's Ellen Carson:— er — Barclay, I mean,\" she corrected. \"I can't get used to Ellen and John being martied.\" Mark shrugged. \"Neither can Ellen and John, I'll wager. How many years do you suppose it was that they were going steady?\" Anne shook her head. \"Years and years.\" \"T was just a kid, I know,\" Mark said thoughtfully. He started the car at the green light. \"I remember we used to play jokes on them, tacking 'Just Married' signs on John's old Model T. Once we gave them a charivari. I don't like to remember John's face even to this day.\" Anne frowned. \"Boys can be so mean.\" \"And girls,\" Mark added. \"Ellen was such a pretty girl, and some of the others didn't spare her feelings 162 much.\" He swerved the car to avoid an oncoming one. \"And John — we called him Jack then—was the best pitcher Hanford ever had. 'That must have been twenty years ago, at the least.\" \"You have a good memory.\" \"No. Jack had all of us kids organized into competing teams. I! Was seven or eight years old and he taught me that slow curve of ints. The one that made him famous. \" Mark smiled reminiscently. \"We had some great teams, I tell you, for just kids.\" He turned the car into Maple Street. \"You know how boys will idolize a young fellow like that. | remember I decided I was going to be just like Jack when I grew up.\" He broke off. \"Funny what life does to people, huh?\" \"No, not funny,\" she answered soberly, brushing at bits of leaves on her skirt. She turned quickly toward him. \"We will be married this time, Mark. We will be.\" Mark's smile moved over her face lovingly. \"(Next month, sweet. And we'll tell your Dad and Mother for sure, as soon as we get you home?\" Anne's gray eyes flinched from his for a second, then she put her face against his shoulder. \"The very minute,\" she said, with a show of courage in her voice and face. WHEN Mark pulled his car to a stop under the huge maples that guarded the big old house where the Hendersons lived, Josie's car was the first thing that met their eyes. \"Qh,\" Anne said faintly, \"oh!\" Mark frowned at her worriedly. \"You're not going to let your sister scare you out of telling, are you?\" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 Anne straightened decisively. \"No, I'm not.\" She climbed out of the car and went up the walk, her green coat making a splash of color against the maples. She smiled back at him reassuringly, but her lips held a tremble in their softness. Before they reached the porch, they could hear Josie's high, light voice, her laughter. \"Feature that!\" she was saying as Mark and Anne came in. \"Two of them, a boy and a girl! Can you imagine?\" Josie, a small, determined, blonde woman of about thirty, was sitting on the arm of the old-fashioned settee. She turned laughingly toward them. \"I suppose you've heard the news. I was just telling Dad and Mother.\" Anne motioned Mark to a chair, then went to hang up her coat. She stopped beside her mother's rocking chair to pat her shoulder, smiling down at the spare, helpless-looking woman. She picked up her father's cane and replaced it in reach of his hand, then tumed to Josie. \"What news?\" she asked. Josie's face registered exasperation. \"T declare, Anne, sometimes I think you're only half alive. Ellen and John Barclay have adopted two children! Two, mind you. A threeyear-old boy and a two-months-old baby girl. Can you tie that?\" \"Well, that's fine,\" Anne replied. \"I'm glad. Ellen loves children.\" Mark spoke up. \"Good old Jack. Now he'll have a boy of his own to teach that famous slow curve.\" Mrs. Henderson shook her head. \"Adopting is a terrible responsibility,\" she said hopelessly. \"When they're your own, you have to do the best you can by them. But some THE HOUSE OF LEAVES one else's! I don't see how they dared.\" She shook her head again and took up a roll of knitting from her lap and inspected it. \"Annie, I've dropped a stitch.\" She held it out. \"It's a sweater for the baby. Josie wants me to finish it.\" Anne gathered it up, pulled back the needle until she could pick up the stitch, then slipped the others back on. \"Here you are, Mother,\" she said. \"Where did they get the children from, Josie?\" \"The Home.\" Josie rolled her eyes. \"They must have gone and applied right away after they were married. It usually takes months and months. And I hear they almost got a refusal at that, they're so old.\" Dad Henderson spoke up. \"Hope _ they use more sense in raising them than the young folks do nowadays. Running loose like wildcats at all hours, and with no respect for their elders, either.\" \"Ellen was a good girl and a good daughter,\" Mother Henderson said, knitting away. \"She'll do right by them just like she did with her parents. John Barclay was dead set on him and Ellen getting married. He'd even promised they could move in with her father and mother but EIlen knew it wouldn't do. Not with that pair.\" She shook her head wisely. \"\"T'wo families in one house, you know. And if there're young ones! 'T'sk—tsk!\" ARK looked at Anne. She was sitting quietly in a chair by the window. 'The late afternoon sunshine through the small panes of glass highlighted her hair to burnished copper. They couldn't have found a worse time to tell of their 163 wedding, he thought morosely. The atmosphere was the same as ever, sapping Anne's resolution. He sat rigid, watching her wordlessly. _ She must have felt his eyes upon her for she spoke up suddenly. \"Mark and I were looking at a building site this afternoon. We're to be married next month, the twentieth.\" The effect of her announcement was comparable to the sudden stillness that follows a clap of thunder. No one spoke. 'Then, out of the bottomless silence, Josie's words came like a whiplash of lightning. \"You intend to move out and leave Dad and Mother alone?\" she asked. \"You, all they have left?\" \"We would be quite near,\" Anne said through white lips. \"In that new subdivision over by Oak Grove. And until the house is built, we've rented an apartment only a block away—the Davis Flats.\" Josie's face was scarlet with anger. \"You know it's always been understood that you were to stay with Dad and Mother. You know that,\" she expostulated. \"You and I are all that are left here. I have my family. I can't take care of them.\" Mother Henderson dropped her knitting and began fumbling for a handkerchief. Dad's face was taking on that look of resigned patience that Mark knew was the hardest of all for Anne to bear. \"Couldn't expect her to stay with us, Mother,\" he said. \"We babied her too long, I guess. A town wouldn't have two like Ellen, staying on till she got the old folks buried. No, that'd be unreasonable, I suppose.\" Anne's eyes, sick, forlorn, and bewildered, flew to Mark's.

Had anyone questioned my feelings about the Relief Society a little over a year ago, I would have told him that I had a great deal of respect for the organization and for the women who comprise its membership. I might have mentioned that my mother and my grandmother and my husband's mother had been active workers in the organization for as long as I could remember, and I would have said that someday when my children were grown I, too, intended to become a member of Relief Society. 'Then I was asked to help with Relief Society work in our newly organized branch, and now I wish that I could convert every young mother in the Church to membership and participation in this God-inspired work, for I believe that there is no organization in the world, be it civic, social, religious, educational, in which a young mother can find the opportunities and the advantages Page 164 which the Relief Society affords. The cultural and educational and social opportunities afforded by the lessons and activities are of inestimable value to the young mother, for we are taught skills and given ideas helpful in rearing our children, keeping our families properly clothed and fed, and making our homes comfortable and_ beautiful. We are introduced to the finest in music and literature and are encouraged to cultivate refinement and culture in our homes. We arte given opportunities and responsibilities for leadership which contribute immeasurably to our personal growth and development, and we associate with women whose sweetness of spirit and purity of lives and devotion to duty inspire love and friendship which is unequaled in any fraternal organization that I know of. These opportunities within themselves justify membership in the Relief Society and yet there are other values which to me are of even greater worth. One of the presidents of our Church has said that the only reason for the existence of an auxiliary organization is the obtaining and building of a testimony of the gospel and the Messiahship of Jesus. I cannot remember a time in my own life when I have not believed with all my heart that this gospel was A YOUNG MOTHER DISCOVERS RELIEF SOCIETY 165 true and I am so grateful to my parents and my teachers for this testimony. 'Today I can stand before you, my dear sisters, and say that I know this gospel is true and that this organization is founded on principles the practice of which will lead every woman who earnestly and prayerfully and humbly seeks for such knowledge to a personal testimony of the gospel. In my opinion, such a testimony can do more to promote personal happiness than anything else in the world. I sincerely believe that it is important, not only to the living of one's own life, but to the successful fulfillment of woman's greatest role of wife and mother. I came to the Relief Society, my dear sisters, after three unsettled years of army life. 'These were not unhappy years because wherever we went we carried with us our faith in God and our desire to keep his commandments. Yet, although we never doubted the gospel, we could not help catching the feeling of unrest and anxiety for the future that was so prevalent among our associates, and although we always believed very deeply that the gospel was true, we were worried about our future. As our knowledge of the gospel has increased and as our testimonies have been so strengthened, we have come to understand the meaning of the \"peace of Christ which passeth understanding.\" We have found that faith and hope leave no room for doubt and fear, and we know that although we cannot insure a world of peace for our children, if we can just teach them to love the Lord and to desire to obey his commandments they will have an inner security which all of the gold could not buy. HERE is another joy which comes to those who work in the Relief Society, a joy which only those who have tasted it can know and that is the sweetness of service. How better could we do this, my dear sisters, than by engaging in this great work which is devoted to feeding and clothing the hungry and needy, bringing help to the sick and comfort to those who mourn? I believe that if we could just fulfill the true objectives of this organization we could find no task which would be more Christlike; I believe we could find no greater recompense for services rendered, for God himself is waiting to reward us with the joys of heaven, not in some far-distant reaches of eternity, but here on earth, if we will but grasp this opportunity to serve him. My Relief Society membership has helped me, also, to one of the most glorious realizations in my life. Nothing has brought me greater joy than the awareness that I am living the fullness of existence by being a mother. To me motherhood is the highest and holiest service that women can render. No calling could be more glorious than that of nurturing in mind and body and spirit these most precious of God's gifts to us, his children. The cognizance that I have some responsibility for the glorification or the spiritual destruction of my husband and children invokes a sacred dedication to God to live to the best of my ability according to his teachings, and a prayer that he will bless me with the strength and love, the wisdom and understanding, that will enable me to fill to the fullest measure this sacred calling which is mine.",

    "content": "Hawaii and the Latter-day Saints Rosannah Cannon Irvine Former Member, Relief Society General Board ESUS said, \"Go ye into all the J world, and preach the gospel to every creature' (Mark 16:15). Inspired by that sacred injunction, missionaries were sent to carry the \"glad tidings\" to the natives of the Sandwich Islands. 'Ten young men, who were working in the gold mines of California at the time, were chosen. They were not miners for per sonal gain, but for the benefit of their impoverished Church. 'They were called and set apart by Apostle Charles C. Rich, who was authorized to do so by President Brigham Young. 'The names of these men are worthy of note: Hiram Clark, president of the group; 'Thomas Whittle, Henry W. Bigler, James Keeler, John Dixon, 'Thomas Morris, William Farrer, James Hawkins, Hiram Blackwell, and George Q. Cannon. December 12, 1850, after a four weeks' tortured and terrifying sea voyage, these missionaries arrived in Honolulu, friendless, homeless, sick, half-starved, and totally exhausted. The sight of the beautiful city and the thanks to their Heavenly Father for at last finding themselves on dry land, made them forget, to some degree, their physical suffering and mental distress. Their first act was characteristic of the pioneer spirit of our early Church members. 'They climbed a nearby mountain and built an altar where they knelt in prayer, giving grateful thanks for their safe deliverance. There is an old adage that, \"The Page 166 saddest fortune may be turned to beauty by patience and faith.\" With these men it must have taken superhuman faith and patience to carry on. In beginning their work, these elders, being unable to understand the natives, their language, or customs, devoted their attention to the white people. 'They soon discovered, however, that the \"haole\" (white people) were stubbornly hidebound in their own particular religious sects. Protestant missionaries had begun their work there many years before the Latter-day Saint mission was opened and most of those people and their ministers were bitterly antagonistic to our Church. Making no progress with them, half of our delegation became discouraged and left, some for home and some for what they thought might be more fertile fields of labor. Among this last number was President Clark, who before he left, however, baptized a sixteen-year-old boy, the first Hawaiian to become a member of the Church. 'Those who remained where they had been called to labor were James Keeler, Henry Bigler, James Hawkins, William Farrer, and George Q. Cannon. George Q. Cannon felt strongly that they should remain among the people to whom they had been sent, and yet his mind was in a turmoil. Being obedient to authority was a vital and necessary principle of the Church, that he believed with his whole heart. And Hiram Clark was HAWAII AND THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS his president, and although he did not insist, he wanted the elders to follow him. In his distress, Elder Cannon sought the Lord in prayer, as was his custom. 'The earnestness of his supplication brought him the definite assurance that he should remain in Hawaii. The four others agreed with him. They also had made it a matter of fasting and prayer. BECAUSE of his determination to do his duty as it had been revealed to him, Elder Cannon was given phenomenal courage and faith, and with it the gift of tongues, the power to understand and love the natives, and a magnetic spirit to attract their love and devotion to himself. Although he was the youngest of the group he soon became their leader, and remained so until the arrival of more elders from the States, with Philip B. Lewis as mission president. 167 These first missionaries, and those who succeeded them for many years afterwards, were real pioneers, and bore many hardships, but they were stalwart and faithful. Among the names of those early missionaries, was that of Joseph F. Smith, a mere boy of sixteen at the time, but with an integrity and faith unsurpassed in Latter-day Saint history. Joseph F, Smith performed four missions in Hawaii, and was dearly beloved by those people. In 1860, a man named Walter M. Gibson, who had recently been baptized into the Church, went to Hawali, representing himself as president of the mission. 'This was when the saints on the islands had been left temporarily to themselves. On account of the Johnston Army trouble, the Utah elders had been called home. Gibson's spirit and policies were so utterly different from the real missionaries that the faithful saints became suspicious PULEHU CHAPEL AND MONUMENT This chapel and monument have been erected on the sacred ground where the first Hawaiian branch of the Church was organized. 168.

Benson and Lorenzo Snow, with Elders Joseph F. Smith, William W. Cluff, and Alma L. Smith, were sent in 1864 to the islands to investigate. Their findings proved that the fears of the natives were well-founded. Conditions were so bad that it was necessary to excommunicate Elder Gibson. He had made many followers among those whose faith in the gospel was not strong. While going from one island to another, the small boat in which Brother Snow and the other elders were traveling, was upset in a turbulent sea. Those who reached the shore safely discovered that Brother Snow was missing. He was finally found under the capsized boat. He was Carried to the beach by his anxious companions who worked valiantly to restore life in him, although the doctor had pronounced him dead. For fifteen minutes he had not breathed. But his brethren still clung to hope and faith. Finally, their prayers and efforts were trewarded. 'To those who saw this miraculous transformation from death to life, it must have been a lasting testimony that it was truly the work of God which Lorenzo Snow had been spared to do. WHEN their unpleasant task with Mr. Gibson was finished, Elders Snow and Benson returned to Utah, leaving Joseph F. Smith to preside over the mission. With the exception of Brother Snow's brief official work in Hawaii, Joseph F. Smith has been the only active Hawaiian missionary who became President of the Church. It has been said that \"A singing people is a good people.\" That is true of the Hawaiians. They are a singing, happy, pleasure-loving people. And their happiness is largely HAWAII AND THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS in giving joy and happiness to others. A mutual feeling of interest and warm affection is characteristic of all missionaries and their converts. That is the spirit of the gospel. It seems to be particularly true of the Hawaiians and the messengers who brought them word of the everlasting gospel. 'These good people were apparently ready and waiting to receive the glad message. In eight months after the arrival of the first missionaries there were 220 converts; and before George O. Cannon left, three and one half years later, there were 4,000. These figures are all the more astounding when one considers the tremendous handicaps under which the first group labored. They were pioneers, friendless, lacking in experience, ignorant of the language and habits of this foreign BE KR RR KR 169 people, on an uncharted sea, so to speak. Those who followed them had half their battle won by having the way opened to them, friends to greet them on their arrival, and initiate them into their work, converts already made and waiting to greet their new Latter-day Saint friends. In accepting the gospel, the people accepted the missionaries as well. They took them into their homes, waited on them, shared their meager supply of food, often denying themselves their portion to give to their visitors. The popular native \"poi\" was very distasteful to the missionaries. In My First Mission, George Q. Cannon wrote: I tasted a teaspoonful of poi, but the smell of it and the calabash in which it was contained was so much like that of a book binder's old, sour paste that when I 63 tas? ° THE CITY OF HONOLULU, HAWAII This photograph, taken from Aloha Tower, shows, on the right, the famous \"Punch Bowl,\" where, it is believed, the first Latter-day Saint missionaries went to have prayer and dedicate the land, soon after their arrival December 12, 1850. Q. Cannon received instructions from the Lord, and was told to preach to the George natives of Hawaii. It was here that 170 put it in my mouth I gagged. But in travelling among the people I soon learned that if I did not eat poi I would put them to great inconvenience... And might interfere with my success. I therefore determined to live on their food. And that I might do so, I asked the Lord to make it sweet to me. The next time I tasted it I ate a bowlful. My prayer was answered. I positively liked it. It was sweeter to me than any food I had ever tasted. N order to have a gathering place for the saints, a large tract of land was purchased by the Church. President Young wrote to King Kamehameha explaining the reason for the project: They will go there as religious teachers; but while this in their calling, they will not confine their labors to spiritual matters only. According to the precepts of our religion, the spiritual and temporal are so intimately blended that we view no salvation, or system of salvation, as being complete which does not provide for the welfare and preservation of the body as well as the spirit. For many years the saints labored on the plantations, but the results were somewhat disappointing. 'I'he fact that the missionaries in charge of the project were changed, as their missions ended, after about two years, added to the lack of success. Toward the end of the century, in 1885, the people were disheartened. A meeting was called to consider abandoning the project. President Joseph F. Smith was in the conference. He made a wonderful prophecy. He told the people that they should not despair. He promised them that beauty and fertility would result from their labors if they would be patient and faithful and diligent. To overcome one difficulty, the short-term supervision was abolRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 ished. Brother Samuel E. Woolley was Called as permanent manager of the plantation. 'That proved to be a great advantage. Under his wise leadership and supervision, the prophecy of President Smith was fulfilled. The place has become beautiful and has prospered surprisingly. Besides becoming a financial asset to the Church, it has provided work and a comfortable living for many members. In 1900, on the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the mission, President George QO. Cannon again visited Hawaii. 'There were some members still living who had known him half a century before, and there were many others who had heard of his remarkable work. He was greeted with wonderful demonstrations of love and respect. In the Hawaiian mission, the auxiliary Organizations are in a favorable condition. The Relief Society, organized in 1875, is sustaining the ideals and standards of the original plan. Women in this endeavor have been as active and efficient as in every other phase of life. The Hawalian sisters are to be commended for their exquisite needlework. 'Their lovely quilts, on which the work is perfect, are especially notable. For these, there is a constant market at excellent prices. Our Hawaiian sisters have adopted American ways in their homes, giving attention to sanitation, modern comfort and convenience. Besides the hundreds of men missionaries, there have been from 1851 to 1941, two hundred twenty-six sisters from the mainland who have gone as missionaries to the islands. Thus is the mighty work of the Lord carried on by his faithful people.",

The plan will include all chapels, buildings, grounds, and any vacant property the Church may own. The program will be so planned that it will encourage all members to beautify their homes and surroundings. A letter has been sent out by the Presiding Bishopric suggesting that the building supervisor in each stake, working under the direction of the stake presidency, will have charge of and direct the campaign in his respective stake. Ward bishoprics and branch presidencies will organize and call to their aid the local priesthood and auxiliary groups to help put over the program, without the expenditure of Church funds. It will be the purpose to thoroughly clean every nook and corner; and clearing of every closet will be part of the plan. Removing every fire hazard from and around our buildings will be emphasized. No extensive landscaping plans will be stressed at this time, but we will be asked to plant lawns and flowers. An appeal will be made for better sanitary conditions to help safeguard the health of our people. This program is not a new idea. Our pioneers, one hundred years ago, encouraged the members then to beautify and make their homes good places in which to live. President Brigham Young said: \"Study order and cleanliness—adorn your city and neighborhood—make your home lovely— make it neat, nice, and clean.

Above the level of a regular year's activity rises one accomplishment which will tower with greater significance with the passing of the decades. As in every year there were countless acts of sisterly love and devotion tendered the less fortunate and sorrowing. Long and arduous hours were spent in making clothing and processing food for saints residing in countries where living conditions continue to be meager. 'That charity which never faileth, the mainspring of the society, was fully made manifest. And, added to this service, a marvelous achievement was completed, one which the sisters of Relief Society have desired since the early days—to raise money for a Relief Society Building. This dream has, during the past year, seen fulfillment. The magnitude of the task which the sisters had set for themselves seemed at times well-nigh impossible of accomplishment. But, blessed with the approval of the First Presidency in this undertaking, Relief Society leaders throughout the world invoked the spirit of our Heavenly Father to enter into the hearts of the sisters for this great cause. Page 174 The results have shown that these prayers have been answered in a marvelous way. The lonely widow, the young mother, the mature woman, the sister sitting in a thatched hut, the one huddling around a scant fire, the member dwelling in the warm climes of flowers, and the one living in the barren, icy wastelands—all joined hearts and hands to fulfill this dream of their beloved Relief Society. In addition to the half million dollars asked of them, nearly sixty additional thousand have been given by those whose hearts were inspired with love and overflowing with generosity to their cherished Relief Society. And, on this anniversary, the general board expresses its deep gratitude and appreciation to all members of Relief Society throughout the world. For your diligence and faithfulness you have been abundantly blessed and, inasmuch as full obedience is given to the instructions of the Priesthood which presides over Relief Society, and Relief Society members give unselfishly of themselves, rich blessings will continue to be poured out upon the sisters, and the women of the Church will find eternal joy. Such is the prayer of Sister Spafford and the general board from hearts filled with gratitude for the goodness and accomplishments of Relief Society members during the past year. M. C. S.

Mr. Hadfield had been in the navy and since my Bob had been in the navy, too, we had a common interest. From the war we went to economics. It was the subject nearest his heart since he taught it. Mrs. Hadfield added her share to the conversation in a way which indicated that she, also, was educated. They asked me all about the city. Especially they were interested in Temple Square. \"Your Tabernacle organ,\" Mrs. Hadfield asked, \"would there be any chance to hear it? I play the organ a little myself, so I'm partial to organ music.\" I was very happy to tell her about the organ recital every day at noon, \"T'll tell you what,\" I volunteered, \"If you like, I'll go with you someday. Maybe I can show you a few things that you might not see if you went alone.\" \"Would you? Oh, I'd love that. Pll be looking forward to it.\" Both of them invited me to come again soon and I assured them that I would. (CROSSING the yard to our house, I decided that I would try to find a day next week to go to the organ recital with Lucille Hadfield, but I didn't.

And always I Was surprised, she had impressed me as being so full of energy that I couldn't associate idleness with her. A few times I stopped by the fence and talked to her, and she seemed so interested in whatever I had to say. I apologized for not having had a chance to go to town with her. She was very understanding. \"I know all about weddings,\" she told me. \"We had three in the family last summer. Actually we were 4 little tired of them before it was all over.\" \"IT should think so. Well, it's over now and I won't be so busy. Why don't we plan to go to the recital this Wednesday, or maybe you've already gone.\" \"No, I haven't. I'll be looking forward to Wednesday, then.\" \"Good. We can go to lunch af. Ter and make a day of it, if you'd like.\" But on Tuesday night Dan's sister Beth came in from St. George. It was always nice to have Beth and since she came so seldom I did like to spend the time with her' while she was here. Much as I hated to disappoint Lucille Hadfield, I just couldn't go. \"Of course, I understand perfectly,\" she answered, when I called her. \"Don't worry about me, I can go just anytime.\" \"Tm surprised Lucille hasn't become discouraged and gone by her- 180 sclf,\" I told Beth as I hung up the phone. \"She probably has,\" Beth replied. \"I wouldn't be concerned about it She probably goes to town every day, with nothing at all to do. | don't imagine that she is too lonesome.\" \"IT guess not, but I am going to spend an afternoon in town with her before she leaves to go home since I suggested it.\" It was my turn to entertain my club on the first Thursday in August and I decided to ask Lucille Hadfield to come. Although I had invited her over repeatedly a special invitation would make her know that I was sincere in my efforts to be friendly. \"This is Kate Crandall,\" I said when she answered the phone. \"Oh, hello,\" her voice was sunny. \"It's nice to hear from you. \"Did you have a nice visit with your sister-in-law?\"' \"Yes, I did. You see I was teared in the country, too, and she brings me up to date on rural things.\" \"Tm rural-minded, too. Most of the time I find the city rather dull.\" \"Well, it can be. What I called for is to ask you to come to my club on Thursday afternoon if you will, It's here at my house. There are about a dozen of us. It isn't a card club, more of an art club. Sometimes we sew or have a book report. This time we are having a lesson on stencil painting. Have you ever done any?\" \"No-no, I haven't.\" \"Well, it's simple to learn. ['m going to town tomorrow, and I'l] get the materials you'll need for you if you'd like me to.\" There was a long pause then. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 When she finally answered I was prepared for her excuse. \"Pm so sorry, Mrs. Crandall.\" Her voice sounded strained and so different from what it usually did. \"But I just remembered that I'm meeting 'om tomorrow afternoon. He doesn't have a class and we're going to town.\" It was a very lame excuse; quite obviously she didn't want to come. I hung up the phone, feeling like I had been slapped. It sounded so unlike her. Maybe, after all, she wasn't interested in being anything but a casual acquaintance. Maybe all of her friendliness was only a charming front. Still, she 'had always shown so much interest in whatever I had talked to her about, and had seemed so enthusiastic when I had suggested taking her to an Organ recital.... Maybe, after all, I should just skip the whole thing. She had never been in my house, and now she had made it plain that she didn't care to come to my club. So I forgot about it. THE August days hurried by, with autumn sneaking quietly toward us. I had seen very little of Lucille since I had called her. Sometimes. From my kitchen window, I would see her sitting out in the hammock. One time I waved to her, but she didn't wave back, so she must not have seen me. I was working out in the back one evening after dinner when Mr. Hadfield drove into his yard. | could see that he was alone and that seemed rather odd because she was always with him. Then I remembered that I hadn't seen her for days. (Continued on page 214) 182 BOOKS BY THE FIREPLACE ARE CONVENIENT AND ATTRACTIVE Too often the volumes in this group get jumbled together so that they detract from the appearance of the home. This condition can quickly be improved by working over this collection, disposing of all waste material, and classifying and filing in a suitable cabinet or file case all pamphlets and papers which are worthy of saving. Such a cabinet is easily made by a handy man, or it can be purchased for a few dollars. Then, using paste, shears, transparent tape, and binding cloth, repair all volumes which have become frayed or torn. This can be developed into an interesting hobby. Finally, important volumes should be rebound, to ensure their preservation. After these things have been done, give this group of books a wellchosen place on the shelves, and they will add greatly to the general tone of the home library. A fourth group of books offers special incentive for display. 'These books are the new ones in their RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 bright jackets, and books which are constantly referred to, such as the standard works of the Church in their prim embossings. 'They challenge attention at once, and since they are currently being read anyway, they look well between bookends, or in a special place of honor on the shelves, within easy reach at all times. They may grace a table or a desk, subject, however, to frequent change. This part of the collection might be considered the priming spark of interest. Cared for along these lines, the home library becomes not merely a supply of books, but a vital, growing entity of book charm, always an important part of the home decoration, always a storehouse of knowledge and inspiration, becoming richer with the passing years.

When towels are both colorful and plentiful, we have a different color for each member of the family. Sometimes they are just white towels with the stripes of the colors. As each child came into our home, we added a different color. Children like the feeling of ownership, and I'm sure you will find, as we did, that they will soon take delight in hanging up their own towels and in keeping them clean. I can just hear our tiny tots, pointing to the wet clothes on the line on washday, saying: \"That's my towel. When will it be dry?\" And I seldom put them away after washday, for willing hands were anxiously waiting to put their own towels away and hurry back to take the stacks for Mother, Father, Grandpa, or guest. There have been times when we could not buy the particular color we ase SO we labeled the towels and the racks, being sure that each member of the family, as well as guests, had his own towel. It doesn't take long to write the names in large letters and with a coarse boilproof silkaline thread, chain stitch over the letters using a particular color of thread for each member of the family and for the guest. Name tags for labeling the towel racks can be purchased at most any book and stationery store or they can be made of a strip of used tin can, bending both edges over a knife blade to allow the insertion of the name card. Try labeling your towels, and it will surprise you how few towels you will have in the wash each week and how long they will wear. 'a 1 Art Seacher C.

    "content": "Antiques to Know and Cherish Lorene Pearson Illustrations by Elizabeth Williamson HERE is much in the history of New England that approximates the history of Utah. Both regions were settled by farmers, craftsmen, and small tradesmen who came to their respective wildernesses with the idea of staying and of multiplying, that the convictions for which they suffered exile might be established solidly on a spot of earth that would forever thereafter bear the stamp of their peculiar faith. Both brought with them, or made upon arrival, furniture and household utensils that reminded them of their former homes. American ingenuity, nurtured in this new land, improved upon these articles or was responsible for new inventions. Many of these objects, those so perilously brought on the first journeys, and those lovingly developed, have become dear to us; they are the things that survive ll manner of other changes in our lives. Beginning with the hearth—the first consideration in any home—we have first of all the open fireplace. In our own day the stove in various guises has become more economical, but perhaps the most charming and useful heating unit of all was the cross between the two—the Franklin stove, invented by Benjamin Franklin and used for generations. The idea behind the Franklin stove was one of retaining the wasted heat of the open hearth while at the same time having the open flame. It was a cast-iron affair capable of being Page 188 moved from room to room, and of being vented in the old fireplace. So successful were these stoves that quantities of the original were produced and reproductions and variations have been manufactured down to this day. Lucky is the person who owns one or has a friend who owns one and will permit the toasting of shins at such a comfortable hearth. Next in importance to the pioneer and to the homemaker today comes the table. Fortunate is the person whose family has owned and cherished any of the Early American tables. One of the most charming, in the original and in reproduction, is the butterfly dropleaf type with canted leg, derived possibly from English pieces of the sixteenth or seventeenth century, but in the form we know it, distinctly American. It has always an oblong fixed top supported by four turned legs slanting outward with stretchers near the base, and with two wings which swing out to support two drop leaves. Now that we have a fire and a place at which to eat, we can think next of a place on which to sit, that is, to sit comfortably. At first it was enough to have benches and stools and straight-back chairs, but soon American ingenuity came into play, and the rocker was invented. Several types developed, so thoroughly did the idea take our forefathers by storm, but none was more popular than the so-called Boston rocker. Tress eae! | I _ Pa 3 ies i= he - JS ZY] td = ee =. HOW MANY OF THESE ANTIQUES CAN YOU IDENTIFY? (Answers on page 191) Page 189 190 The making of it was not confined to the area whose name it carried; eventually, every state in the Union had factories; and England, France, Holland, Sweden, and Germany all produced copies. Since 1840, many have been exported to all parts of the world. 'The rocking chair seems to have fallen somewhat into disuse in these days of overstuffed furniture, but there can be a niche for one in any household for use in mending socks, reading a good book, or nursing an infant, and in a home where quilt-making is still a joy, there can be no mote satisfactory arrangement. HEN came the need for a clock to tick away the hours, to add more exactness than the sun could give. Grandfather clocks, of course, were wonderful, but required space, then as now. More practical, more truly American, less expensive, was the banjo clock to hang upon the wall. It is completely functional, and therefore beautiful as well; inside the banjo every part is as carefully lanai as the genius of Simon Willard could make it; outside, the shape is lovely and appropriate for fine carving and gilding. It might almost be said that there has never been an ugly banjo clock, original or reproduction. An article not so much used these days when cooking is not done over the open flames in the fireplace, but one none the less intriguing when owned and used, is the trivet. It is a small, three-legged iron stand with a top large enough to balance a kettle and with a handle to shift it here and there among the live coals for maximum or minimum heat as the housewife may desire. These are still RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 rather widely used in England to boil a pot of water. Many small, useful articles were produced in the early years of settlement and later; these have become collectors' items. Among the glass objects for decoration and use were castors, which consisted of bottles for oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and other daily table needs nested together on a handled stand that could be carried to and from the table with minimum effort. Another little article was the penny bank, which took many beautiful forms; some may be found in tin, in wood, in glass, in pottery. It might be well to think of them as more than decorative in these days, as well as in those other days when thnft was emphasized. There were, of course, many purely decorative pieces made, particularly as the Victorian era approached. There were the quaint hands terminated at the wrist, made of glass or metal or china, attractively sculptured to catch the imagination. Another Victorian bibelot was made by placing wax flowers or small statuettes under a beautiful glass dome; it was called a glass bell. Many creations of the hours of feminine leisure in those times of fantastic redundancy found shelter under the bell. One of the most beautiful of all the small objects made in recent and ancient times was the glass paperweight. All of us are familiar with the solid half-ball of clear glass, but how many are aware of the variety of exquisite designs imprisoned within the antique ones! The production of these was a resurgence of an old art developed by the Egyptians in the twelfth century, B. C. ANTIQUES TO KNOW AND CHERISH About the time of Cleopatra the Romans revived the idea; factories later sprang up all over Europe; it is not strange to see that the American craftsman was attracted to this difficult but rewarding art form. The making of paperweights spans a long period in our country; the Millville rose, one of the most attractive, was made as late as 1912. Fine paperweights were never inexpensive, and 1 as they have become collectors' items, they are one of the mote costly treasures to add to one's home. For those who cannot afford to collect, or do not wish to collect, there is joy in becoming acquainted with these and other antiques and in seeing them in museums or the homes of others, for they are part of our national heritage, our way of life.

    "content": "Cakes Decorated and Designed at Home Eva Willes Wangsgaard ECORATING birthday and wedding cakes can be done at home by any woman with a keen desire, a little creative energy, and a fund of imagination. Some cakes that I saw recently, created and finished by Mrs. Alvin Larsen of Logan, Utah, would fire the imagination and stir the desire in any homemaker, especially one with small children. The tools needed are simple and easily procured at the five-and-dime stores or can be made easily at home. Mrs. Larsen makes many of her implements out of ordinary typing paper folded and cut on the diagonal. The resulting triangle is rolled into a funnel for holding the decorating icing. The tip may be snipped in various designs for very pleasing results. The beauty of the cake depends on the patience and the craftsmanship of the creator. Mrs. Larsen creates all her own recipes both for the cakes and for the icings and blends the standard flavors for individuality and variety. Her decorated cakes, both body and decorations, taste as pretty-as they look, and they look prettier than the first bluebird in spring. Naturally, she doesn't want to divulge all her secrets, but she was kind enough to give me a basic recipe for a child's birthday cake and for the icing to glamorize it. These you will find at the end of this article. Page 192 Let me tell you about some birthday cakes she has made, cakes that you may imitate or that will inspire you with ideas of your own. Judy's was a two-layered, butter sponge cake, ten inches in_ diameter. It was enveloped in pale pink icing and sported a border of rose-pink rosebuds and white daisies with silver centers. Pairs of bluebirds rested among the flowers, four to a wreath. Inside the floral border the inscription read, \"Happy Birthday, Judith!\" In the center, held high on a concealed paper cup, stood a storybook doll, \"Cinderella at the Ball,\" in a deep rose evening gown. We cut into it, and um-m-m, it was so good you could scarcely stop eating! Michael's was a similar cake iced in yellow. Sixteen little merry-goround horses, complete with flowing manes, arched tails, saddles and bridles, galloped around the border. All of these were made of delicious icing. Peppermint sticks held up the paper canopy and the birthday greeting was written in blue icing. Another idea this home artist has conceived is a nursery rhyme cake with such figures as Old King Cole, Little Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, etc., decorating the top. MP. Larsen makes the _ roses, birds, and other decorative figures the day before the cake is baked or earlier the same day so CAKES DECORATED AND DESIGNED AT HOME that they will be dry and firm by the time the cake is iced. She builds each little flower on a bottle cap, making one petal at a time. Fully opened roses, orange blossoms, and other flowers made full-faced, are completed with their tiny gold Ben Hains 193 stamens. She always uses a homemade paper tube for forming birds. These figures are attached to the iced cake with icing which holds them as it sets. _ You may think Mrs. Larsen must be a trained expert and that what \"MERRY-GO-ROUND CAKE\" 194 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1949 Benny Degn SANDRA LARSEN, LOGAN, UTAH, AND HER FIRST BIRTHDAY CAKE she can do has no relationship to what you can accomplish, but she is just a housewife like you and me who has taught herself every step of the way by the trial and error method, with only a talent for design and a great joy in creation behind her. Many women have these traits and are unaware of them. Why not get the few inexpensive pastry tubes and implements which you can buy at the five-and-dime, cut out a few paper triangles, take these basic recipes, and try your hand at the young fry's birthday cake? You may find not only joy for yourself and your children, but you may branch out, as several women I know have, making cakes for fees and winning prizes at the state fairs.. One caution Mrs. Larsen asked me to give you is this: do keep your colors pastel. A drop or two of coloring in a batch of icing for figures is sufficient. Also, she says that she paints the eyes and beaks of the birds and tints the edges of fancy petals with a toothpick dipped in cake coloring after the figures are dry. Another tip, vegetable shortening, being white, is better to use than butter in icings which are to be tinted. BUTTER SPONGE CAKE eggs, beat one at a time in batter. NN eR cup shortening, butter and vegetable shortening half and half. Cup sugar, cream in shortening, preferably by electric mixer. Egg yolks, add one at a time and beat lightly at slower rate.

Colton Director, Missionary Home, Salt Lake City, and Member, Sunday School General Board 66 HE first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre\" (John 20:1). Jesus had risen. It has always seemed so very appropriate that the Savior would choose to rise from the tomb just before dawn of the most wonderful Sunday in history. We can easily believe that the darkness of that night was dispelled with a morning of unusual brightness, giving color to the flowers and filling all the land with beauty and brilliance without glare. How hallowed the morning of that day! Of course, it was necessary to frighten away the Roman soldiers and that an angel should roll away the stone at the door of the tomb. Comparatively few, however, knew of one of the most important events in all the history of the world. Very early in the morning—without show or ostentation—the power of the Lord was made manifest. Oh, the majesty of simplicity! The stone sealing the sepulchre was removed. The disciples who came first found the tomb empty. The linen clothes which had covered the precious body of the Lord and the napkin \"that was about his head\" were lying neatly folded in the silent tomb. To that small group, gathered at dawn near the sepulchre, an angel spoke some of the most thmilling Page 220 words ever to fall on mortal ears: \"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay\" (Matt. 28:6). Granted that this event occurred, as Matthew describes it, nothing ever happened of more importance to the people of this world. He had said he would rise from the dead. Ie arose. The events of that morning affected the destiny of every person born in this world. To the soul convinced that Jesus was resurrected, it becomes the most transcendent event of all the ages. They who seek in faith and sincerity are promised that the same conviction will come to them that came to Peter: \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" To know that is eternal life. Is it not worth seeking? Let us not deceive ourselves. We are not justified in saying that we may not know until we make every effort to know the most important truth in the universe: \"I know that my Redeemer liveth.\" The greatness of the Messiah is not usually revealed in pomp and splendor. The whirlwind or the loud peal of thunder may stir within us feelings of mystery and fear, but after these turbid elements are stilled the Lord of hosts stands revealed by the Holy Ghost which is the still voice of nature. Cowper said: \"Nature is but a name for an effect whose cause is God.\". JESUS—LORD OF THE RESURRECTION We see in nature some astonishing things. Many see in some of them a foreshadowing of the resurrection. Something symbolic may be scen.

    "content": "Our Political Inheritance Elder G. Homer Durham Director, Institute of Government, University of Utah HE twentieth century faces the future with a question: can free societies endure? Our cultural inheritance from the past includes the ideals of a free society. That same inheritance, however, includes absolutism, dictatorship, regimentation, slavery, and control. Freedom and control are twin aspects of any society. As modern men and women face the issue of free society in the twentieth century, it is well to be informed as to the precious nature of the inheritance we have received from the past in order to preserve freedom. Greek Ideals Regarding Government and Citizenship About six hundred years before Christ, events took a remarkable turn in the Hellenic world. Political society began to move slowly towards a situation where men could live in freedom and choose their own way of life. During the fifth century B. C., democracy flourished at Athens. From this period we derive the bulk of our ideals regarding government and citizenship today. What is this inheritance from the past? 'The principal name associated with the establishment of Athenian democracy (510-492 B. C.) is that of Cleisthenes. Under Cleisthenes the constitution of Athens was reformed in such a way as to provide for the development of democracy. Athenian democPage 230. Racy reached its peak during the age of Pericles (463-431 B. C.). This Athenian experience has been immortalized in the writings of Thucydides, in the plays and dramas of Aristophanes, and in the great philosophical wnitings of Plato and Aristotle. Chief among the ideals set forth in Greek experience is that of individual political participation. It is true that Greek democracy rested on a foundation of slavery. The Greeks recognized the existence of slavery as natural. Later societies, rejecting this notion, have undertaken to extend the ideals of Greek citizenship to all their peoples. This is the effort being made in many western countries today, including the United States of America. In ancient Athens every citizen (but not the slave) was a member of the Ecclesia (the Assembly). Public service was looked upon as the highest form of individual expression. The juries of ancient Athens denote the same principle. In modern life too many citizens try to avoid jury service. In Athens, the juries were large, numbering into the hundreds. Service on juries and participation in the discussion of the assembly were eagerly awaited. Not only was the ideal of individual political participation inculcated into the Greek mind but also the ideal of individual responsibility for the welfare of society. Nowadays many people are willing OUR POLITICAL INHERITANCE to enjoy rights and privileges. Very few realistically realize that for every right and privilege there may be a great duty and responsibility. HE ideal of individual responsibility for the welfare of society is nowhere set forth more clearly and more effectively than in Plato's dialogue, The Protagoras. In this great dialogue, Plato has one of his characters explain why it is that men are able to live together in society and not destroy themselves. The dialogue dramatically sets forth the concept that man is a child of God, that man shares in the divine attributes. 'That when \"the desire of self preservation gathered them into cities... They evil entreated one another and were again in process of dispersion and destruction. Zeus feared that the race would be exterminated, and so he _ sent Hermes to them, bearing reverence and justice to be the ordering principles of cities and the bonds of friendship and conciliation.\" Accordingly, to the Greek mind, characteristic in man's nature are the qualities of reverence and justice. The good citizen should live so that these principles are expressed in his life. In interesting style Plato provides a democratic basis for society in describing how these virtues were distributed by the great Greek gods. As we read further in Protagoras: Hermes asked Zeus how he should impart justice and reverence among men: should he distribute them as the arts are distributed? That is to say, to a favored few only? For one skilled individual has enough of medicine or of any other art. Shall this be the manner in which I distribute justice and reverence among men? 231 Or shall I give them to all? \"To all,\" said Zeus, \"I should like them all to have a share. For cities cannot exist if a few only share in the virtues as in the arts. And further make a law by my order, that he who has no part in reverence and justice shall be put to death as a plague of the state.\" In another of Plato's dialogues, The Phaedo, Plato discusses the great doctrine of the pre-existence and the immortality of the soul. The Phaedo is actually the description of the death of the great Greek teacher Socrates. 'Towards the conclusion of the dialogue, Plato places this great speech in the mouth of Socrates as he is about to end his earthly journey: \"But then, oh my friends,\" he said, \"if the soul is really immortal what care should be taken of her not only in respect of the portion of time which is called life, but of eternity!\" This quotation indicates the great value with which the Greeks in their greatest moments, held the dignity and value of human life. The quest for justice, the stimulus towards training the mind, to be educated, to develop the ability to foresee and to anticipate the problems of the future, the ideals of checks and balances, of limited constitutionalism and government— all these are numbered with our inheritance from the Greeks. Roman Ideals Regarding Government and Law The Roman republic flourished from about 50g B. C. Down to the time of Julius Caesar, about 46 B. C. The Roman Republic was inhabited by a hearty yeomanry. The story of the Roman mother, Cor- 232 nelia, is typical. Cornelia was the mother of the two significant Roman reformers Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus. Both of the Gracchi eventually lost their lives as the result of their efforts to help their people. The story is told that one of Cornelia's neighbors called upon her, exhibiting her marvelous collection of jewelry. The noble Roman mother called in her two sons and said, simply, \"These are my jewels.\" The Roman Republic' evidences the ideals of self-government and popular participation as found also in ancient Greece. 'The Roman Republic developed the office of the tribune. The persons of the tribunes were inviolable. Acting on behalf of the welfare of the people, they were given power to veto the action of any public officer found harmful to the people. In turn, the tribunes were subject to popular control of the elected assembly. However, it is in the field of law and administration that we derive our greatest inheritance from Roman experience. In Rome developed the great Jus Gentium. Translated, this phrase means simply \"law of peoples,\" or as it is sometimes called, \"law of nations.\" The Romans had the great capacity in the evolution of their political life to adopt a legal system which provided a basis in_ principle for equality of treatment to all the people of the Mediterranean world—a_ marvelous accomplishment. As such the Roman law spread throughout the entire European world. Today it provides the basis for the jurisprudence of Continental Europe. It has also influRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 enced the making and enforcement of law throughout the entire world. Under this great empire with its great Roman law, public administration also flourished. From about 46 B. C. To the second century A. D., a period of virtually unbroken peace existed. This period of time is called the Pax Romana (Roman Peace). Jesus of Nazareth was born into this world that knew the Pax Romana. The contribution that Roman law and _ administration made toward a safe, secure world in which St. Paul, the great Christian missionary, could deliver his message has had lasting significance for all mankind. The Ideals of English Liberty England has been called the \"mother of parliaments.\" England is the traditional home of government by consent of the governed, majority rule, civil liberty, and representative institutions. It is also the home of the rule of law as developed through an independent judicial system. The net result of our English inheritance is embodied in the phrase \"fair play.\" On the tomb of one of the barons who forced King John at Runnymede (June 1215) to sign the Magna Charta appears the following inscription: \"Magna Charta Is_ the Law and Let the King Look Out!\" Even before Magna Charta, the line of English evolution may be said to have turned towards the development of free institutions and the idcal of liberty under law. When William the Norman conquered England in 1066, he adopted an ancient Saxon practice, expanding the same into the device called, OUR POLITICAL INHERITANCE 233 \"The Great Council of the Norman lish éovernment, The foundations King\" (magnum Concilium).

But then Bob had been well. He had been section boss at Amalgamated Lumbet and Construction Company. He'd been catch on the plant baseball team.-- - Now everything was different. When the lumber mill burned Bob had rescued five of his workers from Bob was a hero. He had a medal and a pension for life, but he had badly burned lungs, too. And he would be a semi-invalid for the rest of his life. Myra thought of the Hendersons the cornet Mr. Henderson had been a semr invalid from a back injury. The old couple quarreled a great deal and since the fire they had become to Myra the horrible example of what she and Bob could become, if she wasn't careful. 'Two people Page 234 chained together through duty and obligation, not love. We'll never bicker and quarrel like the Hendersons, she vowed, and she turned around, her lips tilted in a smile, her eyes Very blue. She gave the same answer she had given every morning since Bob came home from the hospital two months ago, \"Yes, | thought I'd run down to the market.\" \"Bring me a magazine, will you?\" Bob stood with hands on his hips. Sometimes it was difficult to T€ member how ill he was. He looked just the same, his face tuggedly handsome, his auburn hair curling in tight waves. He was wearing 4 white tee shirt with AC on the front. Once Bob had played baseball. Now he had to lie down and rest after the least exertion. She She said, \"Yes, darling. I'll bring you the latest magazines.\" She lifted her mouth for his kiss. His lips scarcely touched hers. Her mind snagged on the fact, and then she looked into the living room and onto the glassed-in front porch that had become \"Bob's comer.\" It was a shambles again, Bob's pajamas on the big chair, 4 jigsaw puzzle dumped on the card table, maga zines and papers tumbled onto the floor. Twice already this morning she had straightened Bob's cornet! Couldn't he at least pick his things up! She saw Bob looking at her in that new, watchful way he had. THUNDERSTORM \"Something wrong?\" he asked, and his voice was curiously tight. \"Wrong?\" she said brightly. \"No, of course not.\" \"Well, hurry back.\" It was almost the final touch, like the final drop of a dripping tap that sends one hurtling into madness. Must he say that every time she left the house? She smiled, \"Be right back.\" HE walked out the back door, down the steps, and around the side of the house. And her steps took her around the block rather than pass the Hendersons. I won't hurry back! She started to cry, tears she brushed angrily away as quickly as they formed. She thought, oh, what's wrong with me. I do love you, Bob. She remembered the scene in the hospital and the doctor telling her, \"If by some miracle your husband lives he will be a semi-invalid.\" And she could hear her words, \"I don't care. If only he'll live!\" \"You're very young, Mrs. Fortest,\" the doctor had said kindly. \"Tt's not easy.\" \"T love Bob, Doctor, and I want to be with him no matter what happens. I'll never complain!\" And now she could hardly wait to get away. She had been braced for the big emergencies that would arise. But there hadn't been any. After the testimonial dinner for Bob, after the publicity had died down, their life had settled into a dull, quiet pattern. She thought, I'll be all nght. It's just the heat and I didn't sleep last night. Bob was prowling around, opening and closing the icebox, 235 tuming on taps, leaving them dripping. She took the grocery list from her purse and studied it. From force of habit she walked fast. Have to hurry back... Take care of Bob The large super-market was crowded, but cool. She was walking towards the meat counter when a voice called, \"Myra Forrest!\" It was Peggy Linford and it was quite apparent that she was going to have a baby. \"Peggy!\" She and Peggy had worked in \"Ruth's Book Nook\" back in Habberton. Myra's hand went out to the other girl and she thought, oh, I wish I were going to have a baby, but it's impossible with the way things are. \"What are you doing in Scoville, Peggy?\" \"Phil's company just transferred him here.\" \"We must get together.\" \"Let's plan to go dancing as soon as Junior is born,\" Peggy said. Myra's throat tightened. \"Bob was injured in the lumber mill fire. He'll never dance again.\" \"Oh, I'm terribly sorry.\" Peggy looked almost as if she were going to cry. \"Oh, we're not so badly off,\" Myra said quickly. \"Bob gets a pension for life. He isn't in bed or anything like that. But he can't work. He just stays home and rests a great deal.\" \"And you take care of him?\" \"Oh, yes. Certainly.\" \"You poor darling.\" The sympathy in Peggy's voice was very real, and all at once Myra had a picture of herself patiently caring for Bob. She had never thought of it quite that way before. 236 It was strangely comforting. She pushed her hair back and said quietly, \"Oh, I love doing it. After all, I am his wife, you know. No sacrifice is too great.\" \"Oh, yes, I know, Myra. I adore Phil, too, but. \"Remember the fun we used to have at the 'Book Nook'?\" She didn't want Peggy to say anything that would disturb the picture in her mind, the. Picture of her sacrificing herself for Bob. Now, and down through the years to come. \"Oh, PI never forget. Did you know that Ruth is opening a shop here in Scoville?\" Peggy asked. \"She wants me to come and work for her after the baby is born, but of course I can't. But I know she would give the job to you.\" The job would be hers for the asking. And it would help out. Bob's pension was very modest. Her spirits soared and then flattened. \"Oh, no, I couldn't. Bob.\" \"Even for half a day?\" \"IT wouldn't think of leaving Bob.\" She was not aware that she stood very tall, that her smile was heroically brave. Peggy patted her arm. An angel, Myra. Angel.\" Again there was that strange, new, intoxicating feeling. \"Oh, no, I'm not an angel, Peggy. I'm just doing my duty, as any wife would.\" HEY parted soon after. Myra crossed ground beef off her list and bought steak. It would pinch her budget, but she would go without something herself so Bob could have the best. The Hendersons were quarreling again. She heard their voices as \"You're A patient, good RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 she turned the corner. \"You can just as well sit in the lawn swing, Zach Henderson! Least until I get the porch washed off!\" \"Don't need to wash the porch off again, and danged if I'm going to move!\" Myra was even with the Henderson's now. She could see Mr. Henderson in the rocking chair on the front porch, his feet on the railing, and Mrs. Henderson standing over him, a broom in her hand. \"You'll move!\" She nodded her head so vigorously that the white bun of hair quivered. \"Or I'll squirt the hose on you full force!\" She marched down the steps, dropped the broom, picked up the hose and turned it on. \"Okay, I'm movin' then!\" Mr. Henderson swung his feet down from the railing and stomped angrily down the porch steps and across the lawn, short and bow-legged, his white hair seeming to stand on end with anger. \"Plagued woman! Think we was goin' to eat off the ([ porch! I'll never talk to Bob like that, Myra thought. Never. Someday people would say, \"Little Mrs. Forrest... SO patient... Never a cross word \" 'The feeling she had had when she was talking to Peggy deepened until it was like warm, sweet honey. She opened the back door of her house, called gaily, \"I'm home, Bob. Everything all right?\" There was no answer. Something had happened. \"Bob!\" 'Terror jagged her voice. She hurried into the front room and stopped. Bob was sitting in the big chair in his corner reading a book. You could nN Asi the ang Paid. \"Dari; | He looked up \"Yeah?\" won't.

Dinner with Bob and her sitting across from each other not talking. After two months of each other's company twenty-four hours a day—what was there left to talk about! No reliving a ball game, deciding what Smith should have done on second base when George hit a two-bagger. No office gossip. Dinner was an ordeal. 'Twice she started to mention her meeting with Peggy and then stopped. Peggy... That would make Bob remember dancing. She was relieved when Bob put his napkin down and stood up. \"You go and rest while I wash the dishes.\" She didn't mention that she was going to iron afterwards. Maybe he would sleep until she was through. She knew some degree of peace washing the dishes alone. There was no sound from the other room. Quietly she pulled the ironing board down from the wall. It squeaked on its hinges. She heard Bob coming. Not again. Not ironing while Bob kibitzed, \"Look, honey, if you'll just be a bit more scientific, that shirt's going to be a whole lot easier to iron \" Swiftly, she put the board back again. She was securing the door just as Bob walked into the kitchen. \"Aren't you going to 'ron?\" He looked disappointed. \"No, I'm tired. Thought I'd finish that story I started last night.\" She walked past him into the living room. It was incredible that in the few minutes Bob had been alone he could have so wrecked his corner. But he had. Again the magazines were spread out open on the floor. She bent and picked one up, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 straightened slowly, as Bob yelled, \"Leave my things alone. It took me fifteen minutes to fix them just the way I wanted!\" Bob had an expression on his face like Mr. Henderson when he stomped down the porch steps. Myra bent and placed the magazine back on the floor and she had a picture of herself through the years, growing thin and frail, looking after Bob. Poor little Mrs. Forrest a veritable angel. It was a touching picture. She said gently, \"I'r: sorry, darling. I didn't realizc. \"You're not sorry! \" Why don't you say what you really think! It annoys you the way I mess things up!\" \"Why, what do you mean?\" The picture of the frail, patient Myra was no longer touching. There was a tenseness in the air like the ominous quiet before a storm. Bob's fingers ruffled his hair and his words ripped through the air like forked lightning. \"I'm fed up with your Florence Nightingale role. You're getting to be a martyr and you're beginning to enjoy it!\" \"A martyr! You've got a lot of nerve!\" The anger within her ignited like gasoline, and all at once the grievances she had held back came flaming out. They stood in the center of the room shouting at each other, and their words were like claps of thunder. \"If you're so fed up, why don't you leave me, then?\" he growled. \"T will. I'm going to get a job at the bookstore!\" \"T wish you would!\" (Continued on page 281)",

The child, with her good little left hand, tugged at the blanket she was trying to wrap around the dolly, then, because she couldn't make it go the way she wanted it to, she held one corner in her mouth while she arranged it around the rubber infant. Never once did she so much as raise the little right hand that hung lifeless at her side, the small fingers curled around like tiny bird claws. \"Make your other little hand help,\" Rebecca pleaded, but, as always, it was no use. \"T just can't, Mother,\" the little girl said, indifferently, and straightway left the room, carrying the doll in. One arm while the blanket dragged behind. \"Oh, there is no use,\" whispered Rebecca. Not even the mechanical words of \"next time\" found a place in her mind now. It was senseless to fool herself. Linda's hand was useless. The little fingers that had been full of pep and vitality only three months ago, were useless now, cut on a piece of glass, made to hang numb and unnatural, all their spontaneity gone. \"Wait,\" the doctors said, \"Wait a little longer. Cut nerves and tendons are slow to heal. Perhaps in time.\" She had waited, waited three long months, each day when she awoke, hoping that maybe today Linda could move the hand just a little. But each day went by the same, and Page 240 each night when she tucked her into bed she breathed again the prayer, \"Qh, dear God, make my little girl's hand well.\" But it was not well. And there was no sign that it would ever be well so far as she could see. And now even the doctor looked grave when he said, \"Wait a little longer.\" By the window where she stood, she turned her eyes out across the garden already beginning to take on the look of autumn. A few dark clouds floated uneasily across the sky. As she watched, a flood of homesickness choked her, a yearning for the home and friends she had left behind six months ago. Perhaps if her husband had not been transferred, perhaps this terrible accident would not have happened. She longed for the feeling of security and peace she had known, not this dreary sensation of hopelessness and heartache. Hot tears stung her eyes. But as she looked she hurriedly dabbed them away with the corner of her apron, for she could see her neighbor, Mrs. Werry, coming up the path, car rying a half dozen faded gladioli. Rebecca straightened her apron and opened the door to meet the sagging face of Mrs. Werry. \"Come in,\" she said and motioned to a chair. The pudgy form of Mrs. Werry sank heavily into the chair while her hand wiped the perspiration from her brow. \"I told Hebe I just had to come in and see how you were, you poor thing,\" she began in THROUGH THE DARKNESS her expressionless voice. \"No matter how I feel myself, after all, I don't have a child with her hand cut off.\" She folded her big hands with the few gladioli in her lap and heaved a weary sigh. Rebecca struggled to keep back the tears that threatened again. She dared not speak. \"T stopped by little Linda out there,\" the toneless voice went on. \"Her poor little hand. She just can't use it at all, can she?\" \"No.\" Rebecca stared at the window. \"Not at all.\" \"You know I had a cousin who had a boy with his hand cut that way.\" Oh, no! Rebecca felt she just couldn't stand to hear the account again, how his fingers never recovered and were always stiff and useless. \"Those flowers, did—did you raise them?\" she asked. The woman looked down at the meager bouquet. \"Yes,\" she said dully. \"I thought a few flowers might brighten you up a little. I did intend to get more, but my back is so lame. Must be rheumatism.\" \"You shouldn't have bothered,\" Rebecca said. \"No bother. Only, as I always tell Hebe, what good are flowers if you have so. Much misery that a body can't stand to look at them.\" Rebecca took the flowers and placed them in a vase. Mrs. Werry wiped the perspiration from her face again. \"Deary me, it's hot. I tell Hebe it's hot as the middle of the summer. 'Takes the energy right out of a person.\" REBECCA _half-consciously arranged the flowers in the vase 241 while she gazed through the window again to where Linda played with her doll by the sandbox. She was picking goldenglows that hung over the fence, picking them with her one little hand and carrying them to cover her doll. Rebecca watched while the child collected a golden mound on the grass; then she sat and lifted them by handfuls into her apron. Now she was trying to gather the folds of cloth with her one hand. But they kept slipping away. \"Raise the other hand, just a bit,' Rebecca kept whispering in her mind. But no, finally the one little hand had gathered the folds of cloth, and Linda skipped away to the doll in its yellow bed, while she sang a gay little tune. But the one little hand had not been quite efficient enough. The apron began to sag and the flowers to tumble. Painstakingly, the little girl tried with one hand to rescue the flowers. \"Please bring up the other one, oh, please, darling, bring up the other little hand,\" whispered Rebecca. But the apron dropped, the hand remained hanging, and the flowers fell in a bright tumble over the grass. Rebecca breathed a tired sigh and suddenly became aware of the dull voice of Mrs. Werry flowing on and on like an endless stream. \"And just think of butter a dollar a pound. Seems like some of us poor folks will just have to starve pretty soon.\" Rebecca turned her attention back to her visitor. \"Almost, I guess,\" she said because she felt she must say something. \"Well, I must go back,\" Mrs. Werry said, wiping her face again. 242 \"Seems like there's never any time for a body to sit a minute. I put some pickles on the stove. Such a lot of work peeling onions and cucumbers. I shouldn't make them. Hebe can't eat them any more. Has a bad stomach, you know. But the boys insist on having them.\" But she didn't go at once to attend her pickles. She remained sitting and wiping her face. It was another fifteen minutes before Rebecca watched her finally go out the gate and down the path to her home, \"My new home,\" she said half aloud, as the heavy steps of her visitor died away. Mrs. Werry with her perspiring brow and her cousin's boy who never recovered, and her own little Linda with only one hand. She sat listlessly on the arm of the big chair and gazed disinterestedly out of the window. The clouds had gathered and hung black and foreboding in the west. Her throat ached. Suddenly she covered her face with her hands and cried long, choking sobs. After a time she became aware of the merry whistle of her husband coming up the path. The new resentment that had been growing on her lately, filled her. How could he be so gay? What was there to be merry about? Didn't he realize that their little child must go through life crippled and handicapped? She heard his footsteps on the porch now. Again she dried her tears on her apron and slid down into the chair with her back to the door. Now she heard him open the door. \"Becky, oh, Becky, where RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 are you?\" he called in his free, impulsive voice. With a half-guilty feeling, she remained silent. 'Then she felt his footsteps coming noiselessly toward her. Did he think he could keep her from knowing he was coming? Why, he had never even been able to walk without waking Linda when she was a baby. She felt his two strong hands on her face, covering her eyes. \"Three guesses to tell who it is,\" he said. \"So, I caught you napping.\" Quickly she pulled his hands away. \"As if I didn't know who you are. Who else would be coming here? And I don't sit sleeping. I have too many things to think about,\" she said angrily, and then she looked into his face and _halfway she wished she could recall the words. But he sat on the arm of the chair and put his arm around her shoulders. \"Listen, Becky, dear, we are invited to go out dancing with the Daltons tonight. Look, it's just what you need. Please don't say no this time. Jack told me where to get a good baby tender.\" \"Oh, Larry, how can you think of going dancing? Dancing when our little girl's hand hangs useless and reminds you every breath you breathe. I don't ever want to dance again. Not ever as long as I live. Besides, I hate this place. If we hadn't come here we wouldn't have had this terrible trouble.\" She slid out of his arm and, without looking into his face, went out of the room, the hot tears burning her eyes. T seemed impossible to go to sleep. Rebecca had watched THROUGH THE DARKNESS Larry playing with Linda, bouncing her around on his back while he, on his hands and knees, was a pony that bucked and galloped. Never once had he seemed to notice her little nght hand that hung useless. It didn't seem to bother him that she had to cling frantically with one hand to stay on his back. Then he had played \"This little pig went to market,\" with her toes, and he recited a piece about the beggars coming to town. He had not mentioned the dancing party again. Now he lay slecping peacefully while she tossed about on her pillow thinking and thinking until she wanted to scream. It was sultry hot. Now and then she could hear a few far-off growls of thunder, probably the last electric storm of the year. A late mosquito that had found its way into the room buzzed its singsong above her head. Twice she arose and went into Linda's room, but both times the child lay quietly sleeping. At last she fell into a troubled sleep where she walked alone in a thick darkness hunting for Linda who was crying and whom she could not reach. She was awakened suddenly by a loud clap of thunder. She sat up quickly in bed. For a minute her world was foreign and illusive there in the dark, and then aching reality crept slowly back. It was still night and the night had already been far too long. Would it never end? She pulled the blind on the window and peered into the darkness. A quick flash of lightning revealed a brief picture in the yard. In that second she saw a heap of yellow with the face of a doll peeping from under the cover. Linda's doll! She had 243 left it out where she was playing. The rain would come and spoil its head. She must go get it. From the closet she secured her robe and slippers and hurriedly put them on before the rain came. Out in the darkness she waited for a flash of lightning to show her the yellow bed. It came and she saw it almost at her feet. She saw the doll's face with its sleeping eyes and its rosy cheeks; and she saw the golden flowers freshened already by a few splashes of rain, lying close together as neatly as though two little hands instead of one had placed them there. She stooped and reached for the doll in the darkness. Her hand fell into the soft bed of flowers. She paused a minute. A curious thought struck her. It was amazing what Linda had learned to do with her left hand. She was naturally nght-handed, and yet, now that her right hand was of no use, She had taken to the other with quickly gained efficiency. Because she was so young. At three it was easy to form new habits. And she would grow and learn to do other things as thoroughly as she had placed the flowers together. God was merciful when he made _ two hands. She should be glad that Linda had one good hand. And then another thought came to her with vivid revelation. Linda was happy with her one hand. She had skipped and sung as she had built her flower bed. Was there a chance that she, herself, might spoil that happiness in her constant remindings and neyer-ending worry? She raised her hand and reached for the doll. Her fingers rested on its cold plastic head.

The physical needs of the family are imperative; food must be provided or the body starves and dies. Hence, the physical care of the child is one of the first requirements of parents.

The knowledge which Latter-day Saints have of this dual nature makes it paramount that physical and spiritual growth go hand in hand to build a complete man or woman. Among the early revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, we read that Father Adam when he was bowed with age called his posterity together at Adam-ondi-Ahman and there blessed his family, telling them what would happen to each succeeding generation from then until the end of time (Doc. & Cov. 107:53-50). It is the most natural thing in a ai RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 the world for parents and children to desire to be together. Parents long for the companionship of their children, and children long for the companionship of their parents. To the mothers I really think belongs the responsibility of stimulating the Family Hour. Perhaps a thought we should keep in mind as mothers is that our children are Heavenly Father's children and that we are only their earthly parents, and that we are responsible to him for our treatment of them. We should also keep in mind that we mothers have the most glorious' mission of any mothers who have yet lived on the earth.

The Lord admonished the saints early in their history to teach their children the principles of the gospel, and if this was neglected the sins of the children would fall upon the heads of the parents. It is to be hoped that most Latter-day Saint parents recognize the teaching of the gospel as a paramount duty; that they do pray with their children; they do encourage them to seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness. The Church program affords many opportunities to stress and teach righteous living. The blessing of a child should be a-day when the family gather and rejoice together that a new member has been added to their group. The ordination of the boys to the Priesthood and their advancement in the Priesthood 247 should be noted; the missionary and his or her farewell and homecoming; the boys and girls as they receive recognition in Sunday School, M. I. A., seminary, and other Church activities all make wonderful opportunities for family gatherings. Summertime, special holidays, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays, Valentines, family birthdays, vacation days, ward outings, reunions, and special days, all make opportunities for families to celebrate together. George Cannon's _ birthday has been a red-letter day in my life since my marriage forty-six years ago. On that day tributes to that great missionary and spiritual leader are paid and his life's work reviewed. Each year the members of his family are made to appreciate their great sire more and more. My father, President Grant's birthday has likewise been celebrated, and I hope all their lives his children and his children's children to the latest generation will recall in song and story his achievements as a father and a devoted servant of God and his fellow men. There are few families in the Church who do not have a _ background of ancestry that will make any gathering faith-promoting and interesting.

Even today, with the railroad crossing the northern end, and w: th a national highway chartered on a road map to guide the tourist, one would tremble to have his car break down on' some lonely stretch of the road. That early explorers crossed this land with no knowledge of its hazards is, in itself, a miracle. It is the opinion of the historian Charles Kelley that men like Jedediah Smith, Captain Bartleson, Christopher Carson, John Charles Fremont, and other intrepid explorers of this most treacherous desert of North Ametica, should have their names and their deeds recorded beside those of the other great explorers of our naaad tion; but so far, too little has been known of them. This great salt plain was at one time covered by the waters of the Great Salt Lake. 'The Salt Desert has a length of one hundred miles, and is about seventy-five miles wide. Evaporation has removed the surface water, leaving only a great level expanse of mud and salt. No vegetation grows upon this waste, no fresh water enters it, and as far as the eye can see, there is a limitless expanse of dazzling white salt plain. In dry places, and during the summer, this plain is in parts hard and smooth, offering little surface resistance, so that cars seem to skim over its surface. One of these places, the Bonbes e Se tz, e ee bs e LOG CABIN WHICH BECAME A PART OF THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN GRANTSVILLE This cabin was built by John W. Clark (not a member of the family related to President Clark). It has been donated by Mr. Clark Jefferies, its last owner, to the Grantsville chapter of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers and is to be used to house relics. MONUMENT ON THE SITE OF THE OLD FORT This monument was erected by the Grantsville Chapter of the Daughters of Utah Pioneers, July 24, 1934. It stands in front of the old meetinghouse which is now the First Ward chapel. Neville Salt Flats, is now used for testing racing cars. But in damp stretches, and during wet weather, wheels bog down in a mud which is like glue; lt must be scraped from the wheels, and will cling to whatever is used for scraping. Early emigrants crossing the desert on the way to California, had to abandon their loads piece by precious piece, sometimes even the wagons themselves, in order to cross this desert. Because of the peculiar properties, there is no erosion, and the prints of the wagon wheels, and even footprints, are preserved in the salt plain. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 The first white man to cross this desert was Jedediah Smith, one of those who explored the Great Basin under General Ashley, in the years 1824-1827. Although credit is usually given to Jim Bridger for the discovery of Great Salt Lake, «tle honors should be shared with Smith and Provost, who discovered it the same year, 1826, each independently of the others. DURING the first year, the little band of settlers fled to Pine Canyon because of danget from the Indians. They had tried to follow the admonition of Brigham Young: \"Don't fight the Indians; feed them,\" but to no avail. During the months which followed, the pioneers hauled logs from the canyon and sold them to make a few dollars. Prices were very high that year, ten dollars a hundred for flour, and other prices in proportion. But in spite of the hard times, they saved $380 which they invested in oxen. In 1852, they returned to Willow Creek and took up farming. At that time, a branch of the Church was organized, with Benjamin Baker as presiding elder. 'The following families comprised the population of the little village: James McBride, Harrison Severe, Thomas P. Watson, William Davenport, Samuel Steele, Wilford Hudson, William Daley, and William Pope. Indian troubles did not end with the first year. In 1853, it was mecessary to build a fort for protection of the settlers, in case actual war should break out. No part of this structure remains standing. The north, west, and south sides of the old fort were of mud, five feet thick 251 » twelve feet high, and Way to and from Tooele, and, at \"lgnteen inches thick at the top.

It was in Farmington that Brother Clark, not then a member of the Church, attended his first Latterday Saint service and was deeply impressed by the principles of the gospel and the sincerity of the people. A short time before his baptism into the Church, he attended April Conference in the Tabernacle. The following account of his impression of Brigham Young is taken from his diary: Brigham Young is about five feet eight inches tall, and weighs about one hundred eighty or ninety pounds. He has a good supply of auburn hair. His beard is getting a little gray, and when walking, his eyes are generally cast toward the ground. Ile has what might be termed a smiling countenance, Mr. Clark was baptized in 1867, and the next year he came to Grantsville as a school teacher, starting school with twenty-nine pupils. 'The school was held in a one-room adobe house, a part of which is still standing. In those days,'the teacher had to accept produce in part payment for the pupils' tuition. He boarded with several families, eventually with the Samuel Woolley family, through whom he became acquainted with Brother Woolley's sister, Mary Louisa Woolley, and fell in love with her. 'They were married July 11, 1870, in the old Endowment House in Salt Lake City. Ten children were born to them, seven boys and three girls. \\ IIE following notes are taken \\ from an account of the early \\ \\ RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 life of President J. Reuben Clark Jr., son of Joshua Reuben Clark and Mary Louisa Woolley: In his boyhood, he 'attended faithfully his meetings, such as Sunday School and Priesthood meetings. He was advanced in the Priesthood as rapidly as age would permit. He was treasurer of the Primary Association of his ward, and president of his Deacons' quorum. He was a home missionary for the stake. President Clark, as a youth, was prominent in the field of recreation, and took part in home dramatics and musical activities. He was a member of the Grantsville Juvenile Band. He knew pioneer life as it was in the early days, and helped his father with the work on the farm. When he was twelve years old, he proudly displayed a cabbage he had raised, at the Pnmary fair. At the age of fourteen, he started helping his father with sheep shearing. He was always obedient to his father, and has said that he never considered himself too old to ask his father's advice. Bryant S. Hinckley wrote this of President Clark: President Clark grew to manhood in the country, and knows something of pioneering. His very earliest recollection is seeing his mother kill a rattlesnake at the back door of her kitchen. In the midst of her other activities, his mother taught him to read and write, so that when he entered the grade schools, he was placed in the third grade. He finished the grades in Grantsville, but as there was no high school in the town at that time, he went through the eighth grade three times. J. Reuben herded cattle for his uncle, Samuel Woolley. He drove them to summer range every spring, and back to winter range every fall. He knows what it is to stay in the saddle all day and all night, to go without rest or sleep for twenty-four hours at a time. The language and the hardships of the cowboy are familiar to him. The only available fuel at that time was wood, which was hauled from the near-by hills and canyons. He narrowly escaped death when bringing a load of GRANTSVILLE AND THE DESERT wood over a deep and dangerous dugway with a lead harness on his horses which made it almost impossible for him to hold the horses. Dr. John A. Widtsoe wrote: The savings of a life unusually crowded with professional and official duties have been used in acquiring and developing a farm. 'The material results of his life's labor are in the land. This is an example for the Church to heed. The home farm of sixty acres of fertile soil and ample water supply produces garden stuff, sugar beets, hay, and other crops. On this farm too are dwelling house, and barns, etc. Horses, cows, pigs are kept. President Clark supervises its every operation, and such time as can be spared from his administrative duties he gives to working the soil, and other essential labor to make the earth yield. President Clark has recently had completed a beautiful new brick home on his farm in Grantsville. He 253 spends many week-ends there. During the summer, his son, J. Reuben Clark IIT and his wife, Emily Anderson Clark, live on the farm and help with the work. Perhaps the settlement of a little town like Grantsville does not seem so great a thing. Yet its settlement, along with that of hundreds of other little towns just like it, their growth and development, their industry and progress, have made up the Western Empire. In these little towns throbs the heart of the West. Perhaps if their founders could come back now, they would be amazed to see the results of their hardships and sacrifice. And no doubt many of them would say, \"Oh, I didn't do so much.\" But to them we might say in turn, \"Just look what you started!\"' HOME OF PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK JR.

If the sheets had become wet or creased they would have been spoiled. Therfore, as soon as it secms safe to send the rolls through the mails, they will be sent. Complete instructions for writing the names of contributors are included with the rolls. Ynstructions Regarding \"Tlotes From the Field ' BECAUSE of limited space in the Notes From the Field department of the Magazine, where a picture shows a large number of people, it will be possible hereafter to identify only the officers and persons prominent in the activity represented. It is hoped that this will allow some additional space for more stakes and missions to be represented each month. It is suggested that Relief Society stake and ward officers and also mission and branch presidents review carefully the directions for submit ting material to this department published in the April 1948 issue of the Magazine.

The little girl making mud pies to be baked in a make-believe oven may, in later years, become a proficient cook. And cooking is a creative art. Closely akin to the art of cooking is that of table setting. It is surprising how the creative urge Can be satisfied through this simple medium. Most up-to-date cookbooks explain the proper way to set a table for various occasions, so I won't go into that, except to say in passing that here one finds those basic principles of art—repetition, balance, and rhythm—and that a well-set table is indeed a thing of beauty. No matter how desirable, it iS often impossible in this high-geared age, for the members of a family to eat all of their meals together, but the dinner hour should be an exccption. Try to serve attractive-looking, palatable, and_ well-balanced food in an unhurried and congenial atmosphere. Use imagination in varying your menus and have occasional surprises for the family in the way of table decorations. You will be pleased to see how they will respond. Take the Easter season, for exPage 258 Tae is in all of us an innate ample. How important a child is made to feel if his colorful basket of easter eggs is used for the centerpiece of the family meal. The favor illustrated here was given to each of a group of mothers at an April dinner in one of the wards. Later, to the delight of the children, the favors did double duty by gracing many an Easter basket. It is to be regretted that the color of this make-believe chicken cannot be shown, for it is very pretty. To make the favors you dye eggs by the usual method in any desired colors. Dip small, fluffy feathers (longer TABLE SETTINGS AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS for the tail than for the wings) in diluted vegetable coloring, and spread them to dry while you mix some frosting of powdered sugar and water to a consistency that can be molded in the fingers. This is tinted red for the comb, yellow for the beak, and as near as possible the color of the egg for the other parts. A wad of frosting holds the chicken's head (which is half a jelly bean) in place, and it supplies the medium for attaching the feathers and the vanilla wafer which forms the base. 259 Here is another idea for an Easter favor which you may prefer. Very cute miniature Easter bonnets may be made by using the small size paper doilies for the brim and a nut cup pasted upside down in the center of the doilie for the crown. Decorate the hat with bits of ribbon, feathers, tiny flowers etc., and place them at each place on a stand made by cutting a straw in half and sticking it in a gum drop. For the center of the table use an untrimmed hat with flowers spilling out of it. [This is the first in a series of short articles on table decorations, flower arrangements, and related subjects. In the coming months Sister Judd will present more suggestions for effective seasonal decorative arrangements.—Ed.] o_>",

Even without a morsel of my care— No help of mine—no vigil day and night, Nor in my thoughtless mind a phrase of prayer, Have I the privilege to view this sight: The miracle on Galilee's blue rim, Once plucked and pondered as men walked with him.

    "content": "An April Day Grace M. Candland Give me the measure of an April day, Unhurried by the many tasks at hand, To watch the growing loveliness of spring Now entering in, and note the interplay Of shifting clouds, the birth of daffodils, The birch and linden pushing silently From bud and leaf, and see the miracle Of bluebells blooming on the distant hills And All Eternity Carol Read Flake HE sharp tmill of the telephone brought Kathy Gordon stumbling from bed, her sleep-drugged mind groping to identify a heavy feeling of depression. The girl shivered in the chill, autumn air as she felt her way into the dining room. It was something —some dreadful thing that lay ahead of her. \"Hello.\" Her voice was low and husky with sleepiness. \"Is this 402M?\" Kathy swayed suddenly inthe darkness as memory struck with sickening clarity. She gripped the edge of the buffet and answered in a whisper, \"Yes.\" She and Dan were going to get a divorce! It had been decided last night. \"Hold the line, please. Deposit five \" The operator left the line. \"Who is it?\" Dan called sleepily from the nursery. \"T don't.. Daleligr\" \"Kathy darling! Ill bet you just love answering the telephone at five A. M.\" Linda! Oh, no—not now! There was a note of hysteria as Kathy cried, \"Linda, what in the world are you doing here?\" Her young sister's laugh rang merrily. \"I'm on my vacation and I want to spend it with my namesake. How is the little doll—asleep? \"Of course. Honey, you're at the bus depot, aren't you? We'll be right in after you.\" Dan had turned on the bedside 'amp in the nursery and, as Kathy Page 260 moved to the doorway, he leaned up on an elbow, squinting against the brightness, his dark hair rumpled. Three-year-old Gary had crowded him to the edge of the narrow bed and was burrowed deep against him, completely out of sight. \"It's Linda?\" Dan's voice was tense. \"What are you going to tell her?\" Kathy's gaze wavered. \"Nothing, I guess. She'd never understand.\" \"Who does?\" he remarked sourly, sitting up and reaching for his shirt. Kathy stared at him blankly, then turned and went into the room they had always shared and to the crib in the corner where Baby Linda slept. She covered her tenderly and dressed without turning on a light. Dan was silent driving to town. Kathy sat beside him, numb and sick inside, wondering how she could meet the gaiety and exuberance of her younger sister. It was two months since her visit home, a visit that was, in reality, a separation. The entire family had been so entranced with the children that they had not detected Kathy's deep unhappiness. Kathy was grateful for this. More than anything else she desired to keep from them the knowledge that she and Dan were having trouble— Dan, whom her father invariably referred to as a \"perfect prince of a fellow.\" Kathy glanced covertly at her husband, silent and scowling as he drove. Was he remembering last AND ALL ETERNITY night, the scene at the dinner table and their talk afterward? We Ke ATHY closed her eyes, seeing him pace the living room, seeing the beaten look in his eyes as he flung out his hands in a gesture of impatience and futility. \"Okay, so it didn't work out. We made a mistake, Kathy, the biggest mistake of our lives, and it's time we did something about it.\" \"Separation didn't help.\" Kathy spoke more to herself. Dan stopped before the mantle and stared at the photograph of himself in his marine uniform. It was Kathy's favorite of all his Pictures. He looked brave and confident, almost cocky, with his cap tilted ever so slightly above that broad, boyish grin. She caught her breath as he reached up and knocked the picture flat. \"Why do you keep that crazy thing around?\" he growled. Her eyes sped to the framed snapshot of Dan and his buddy, Dick Greymont, who had been killed on Guam. Apparently it escaped his attention. He dropped heavily upon the davenport. \"So what's left? What do we try now?\" Their gaze met—and broke hastily. Kathy flushed as if she had spoken the hated word. Dan leaned his head in his hands. \"Dave Whiting's as good as any, I gucss. He handled the boss' divorce. Find out the procedure. If it can be desertion, I'l] pull out.\" Kathy's eyes widened. \"Divorce?\" she whispered. He shrugged and stood up. \"What else?\" he asked harshly. Kathy didn't breathe for a mo- 261 ment. She felt frozen inside. \"You mean—civil divorce?\" The muscles in his jaw tightened. When he spoke his voice had lost its harshness. \"I don't know, Kathy. I've prayed—you've prayed. I don't know what he wants us to do.\" He turned his back. \"Dan!\" — She started up unsteadily. \"Dan, it isn't as if another man Or woman were involved. There's just.\" \"There's a little boy and a baby gitl,\" he reminded her almost angrily. \"And a pair of bickering parents. Is that what he wants?\" He pushed past her and went into the nursery, closing the door firmly. Bickering! Kathy's hands clenched in her lap. Was it bicker. Ing when he barked in irritable impatience at little Gary and sent him weeping from the table? Was it bickering when she leaned forward and hurled the stinging accusation: \"Dan Gordon, you aren't fit to be a father—you're not fit to live with! You hate us all, don't you?\" Anger stirred in her, recalling his contemptuous glare as he shoved violently from the table and left the room. Tight-lipped, Kathy had set about clearing the unfinished meal from the table, trying not to hear the heartbroken sobbing from the nursery. At last she stepped to the doorway and demanded in icy tones if he intended his son to finish supper. When he did not glance up from the magazine he gripped in his hands, she deliberately started for the nursery. He caught up with her and pushed her roughly aside. \"You keep out of this,\" he snapped, and shut the door in her face. 262 Gary stopped crying and Kathy stood there, all aquiver inside, listening to Dan's voice soothing the child. In a moment he brought him to the table. \"Ask Mommie to bring your dinner, son.\" Gary's round blue eyes, still damp with tears, were hurt and_ bewildered as they went from one to the other. Kathy groaned and caught him to her fiercely. She met her husband's cold gaze. \"Dan, this can't go on,\" she pleaded desperately. \"It's cruel and unfair. It—it's shameful.\" Dan muttered something and walked rapidly out of the room. * oe OK OK HE Gordon scene, Kathy thought heavily, glancing out the car window. Dan slowed for a stop sign, his hand brushing Kathy's knee as he shifted. He glanced at her shortly. \"Well, what are you going to do?\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"See Whiting. Get the thing rolling.\" Kathy's mouth twisted and she turned away, unable to speak. This was the way she must meet her sister. She saw her standing on the curb beside her luggage, looking like a fashion model in her trim gray suit and little trick of a hat. Linda rushed over as they stepped from the car and gave Kathy a swift, fragrant hug. Then she turned to Dan. \"M-m-m,\" she said, stretching on tiptoe to kiss his cheek, \"my favorite brother-in-law.\" In the car she removed her left glove and fluttered her fingers elaborately. \"Oh!\" Kathy gasped, catching her hand to admire the glistening ring. \"When did you get this?\" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 \"The night of his farewell,\" the girl announced proudly. \"Isn't it gorgeous? See it, Dan?\" Dan _ smiled obligingly. \"Very gorgeous. And is it the ring you're in love with, or.\" \"It's Brent I'm in love with,\" Linda sang out happily. \"Oh, he's wonderful—it's wonderful!\" She turned and hugged her sister ecstatically. \"Why didn't you tell me love was like this?\" Kathy flushed. \"You little monkey,\" she said tenderly. In the bedroom the girl peeked cautiously beneath the crib covers. \"Oh-h, little angel. When will she wake up?\" She turned to Kathy. Her brows flew togcther. \"Kathy, are you ill—have you been sick?\" \"Sick?\" Kathy laughed quickly and bent to pick up a hanger. \"Of course not, silly. It's just getting up at such an unearthly hour. Make yourself comfy, honey, while I fix breakfast.\" Kathy was glad for the commotion of breakfast and babies—for her sister's gay, eager chatter. After Dan Icft for work, Linda dressed Gary amid shouts and laughter and then begged to feed the baby her cereal. She talked constantly about Brent, his mission, and his letters. \"Regular sermons, he writes. Oh, Kathy,\" she exclaimed earnestly, \"aren't you thankful for the gospel and the kind of men it produces? When I think of poor Rosalind Aytes and that—that—\" She broke off in disgust. \"They're on the rocks already. I guess it's lucky they've had no chil—\" She shrieked and ducked as the baby, clutching the spoon in her AND ALL ETERNITY hand, flipped cereal over a wide area. Laughing, Linda looked up at the baby's mother and was surprised to see her staring absently from the window, her face drawn and white. Linda lifted the child from her high chair and walked around to face her sister. \"Kathy Gordon,\" she said with a quiet, knowing smile, \"you're going to have a baby, aren't you?\" \"Have a baby? No,\" she answered dully, staring past her. \"We're going to have a divorce.\" \"Kathy!\" Linda cried sharply, \"What's the matter with you, saying a thing like that?\" \"It's true,\" she answered quictly, taking the baby from her. \"He wants me to see the lawyer immediately.\" \"Dan? Wants a divorce? But, Kathy, what's wrong?\" \"I wish I knew,\" Kathy replied bitterly. \"I think he hates us all.\" For once Linda was speechless. Helplessly she followed as Kathy put the baby down for her nap and went into the bathroom where she knelt and washed the few clothes that were soaking in the tub. \"T didn't want you to know, Linda, or the folks. But now I guess it doesn't matter, now that we're getting a divorce.\" Linda began to cry. \"But you were married in the temple.\" \"I know. Sometimes temple marriages go wrong.\" \"No, they don't,\" the girl sobbed. \"Only if there is sin—immorality. You and Dan—you're both fine and decent and intelligent.\" Kathy sat back on her heels, staring unseeing at the wall. \"No, Lin- 263 da,\" she said after a moment, \"if you had been here last night you wouldn't say we're intelligent.\" And she told her briefly about Dan's sharpness with Gary and her own fury. \"Oh, Kathy, something's wrong with Dan, don't you see?\" Linda cried. \"It's the war; that wound he got on Guam, losing his buddy...\" Kathy rose and wiped her hands thoughtfully on the towel. \"I could have thought that three years ago, but that's all behind us. No, Linda, we've been happy, perfectly serene in our marriage until—I don't know when it began or what started it.\" \"Maybe it's you,\" Linda said softly. \"Maybe.\" \"I know. I'm critical. But his attitude....\" She pressed her fingers to her temples. \"I think it's since the baby came. He seems resentful of her, Linda—detached, restrained or something. He wasn't like that with Gary.\" \"It's because she's a girl,\" Linda soothed, putting an arm about her. \"Darling, you're practically weaving, standing there. Come sit down.\" She led the girl to the big chair in the living room and Kathy tried to explain about Dan and Baby Linda. X ek KX \"THEY both wanted a girl and he had been as thrilled as she when Baby Linda came. Kathy would never forget his deep humility as he stood at her bedside. \"Everything's too perfect,\" he had said, shaking his head in wonder and awe, \"you and Gary, and now a little daughter. I don't deserve it, Kathy.\" \"I guess we deserve her, darling,\" Kathy had whispered, weary from 264 the ordeal, \"or the Lord wouldn't have sent her to us.\" | He gripped her hand tightly. \"The Lord's been so good to me, Kathy. It isn't right. It isn't fair.\" Kathy had been disturbed by his mood, but too sunk in exhaustion to puzzle out its meaning. \"He feels unworthy,\" Linda announced simply. \"Kathy, if you two would talk these things over \" \"T don't believe he wants to, Linda. Not after last night when we both saw what it's doing to little Gary. He wants me to see Whiting right away.\" \"Whiting? Is he your high councilman that's a lawyer?\" Kathy's eyes widened. \"No. I hadn't thought of him. Her voice fell. \"He doesn't take divorce cases.\" Linda jerked forward on the davenport. \"Why doesn't he?\" \"Why, I. He doesn't believe in them, I suppose.\" Linda's eyes flashed. \"And so instead of going to someone like that for help, you and Dan prefer to take your troubles to some stranger, not even a member of the Church. It wouldn't even have to be a lawyer. It could be your stake president or your bishop \" she broke off. \"I wish you could talk to Brent. Brent says the gospel carries the solution to all our problems, physical as well as spiritual.\" \"Brent and his mission,\" Kathy murmured. \"Dan would have had a mission if it hadn't been for the 9 war. \"Oh, darling!\" Linda was beside her, all tenderness. \"Kathy, you love Dan. I know it. I'm going to talk to him tonight.\" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 ATHY was gathering clothes from the line when Dan drove in late that afternoon. As she put them on the kitchen table she heard Linda talking and Dan answering in low tones. She went out softly and found the rake and started to rake the leaves away from the front of the garage. She heard the screen door open and close and looked up to see Dan coming toward her.. He stopped and then came on uncertainly. \"Do you think we should talk with the bishop?\" Her heart was pounding as she leaned the rake against the wall and came toward him. \"Yes,\" she said breathlessly. \"Yes, Dan, I do.\" They found Bishop Bentley in house slippers seated on the front porch with his wife and a neighbor lady. The Gordons were greeted warmly and the bishop ushered them inside. He was a large, shaggy-haired man with alert, twinkling eyes and the kindest smile. Kathy sat stiffly on the chair he offered and hoped that Dan would do the talking. He did so, haltingly at first. But under the bishop's gentle prompting the story was finally out. The bishop questioned them alternately, nodding now and then in an understanding way. Then he leaned forward in the big leather chair and regarded them with a kindly, sympathetic expression. But when he spoke he was firm. \"Now, Brother and Sister Gordon, I want you to put the idea of divorce out of your minds. Neither of you has committed a crime against the other and there's no justification for it. You are unhappy, yes. But you can't think of your- AND ALL ETERNITY selves any longer. Children.\" \"That's why something must be done,\" Dan broke in desperately. \"Tt isn't right that.\" \"And you think divorce is right?\" Bishop Bentley spread out his large hands. \"Split-up parents—a broken home? No.\" He shook his head. \"Even a sick home is better than a broken one, Dan, in nearly every case. Yours is a sick home right now. But if you will, you and Katherine, you can cure it. Have you prayed together?\" he asked gently. Dan looked down. \"We always have, bishop, but when there's a spirit of—of bitterness and antagonism.\" \"It's difficult, son, I know.\" He asked abruptly, \"Dan, you were injured, weren't you, in the war?\" \"Yes, a hand grenade wound. But it doesn't bother any more.\" \"Did you have any experience you find it difficult to throw off?\" Kathy glanced quickly at her husband and felt a wave of tenderness as she saw his jaw set. When he didn't speak she said softly, \"He lost a buddy, bishop, Dick Greymont, a boy he grew up with.\" \"IT see. Do you ever think about that, Dan?\" Kathy stared in horror as Dan's face twisted and he covered his eyes with his hands. He said in a tortured voice, \"I can't think of anything else lately.\" Tears sprang to her eyes. \"Dan,\" she whispered, moving forward on her chair. But Bishop Bentley raised a warning hand. He said very gently, \"Can you tell me about it, son?\" Kathy waited in an agony of You have your 265 sympathy as Dan fought for control. \"I was a gunner in our squadron, a pfc, like Dick. It was two days after we landed on Guam and we'd been in heavy battle and our shells were running out.\" He paused. \"I sent Dick for ammunition. I hated to ask him to go and he didn't want to, but I only had a few shells left. I—I spoke pretty harsh to him so he'd go. When he started back with the shells, they—a bullet got him.\" There was no sound in the room save Dan's labored breathing. Kathy whispered in a voice that trembled, \"It was right afterward that Dan was wounded—very seriously. He almost died.\" DAN moistened his lips and went on. \"Dick and I went into the Mormon Battalion together; we were at Guadalcanal and Guam. We were always close. We used to talk about when we got back, things we would do. We both had girls. We talked about the homes we were going to have and children—\" His voice broke and his head went down. Kathy closed her eyes in pain, seeing him at her bedside the night Baby Linda was born: \"T don't deserve it, Kathy, everything so perfect.\" It was Dick he had been thinking about! Tears streamed down her face and she forgot about Bishop Bentley. She went down on her knees beside him, sobbing, \"Dan, oh, darling, why didn't you tell me? You musn't blame yourself. You were doing your duty and you almost lost your own life. 'The Lord spared you fora purpose.\" She caught his hand and pressed it to her cheek, feeling 266 the answering pressure of his fingers. \"Dan, I've been so blind—so stupid.\" He touched her hair gently. \"I've been hateful. You said I hated you, Kathy. It was myself—\" \"Oh, Dan!\" The bishop had msen and stood quietly beside them. \"I think, Dan, that you have unconsciously built up a resentment against all that's dear to you because of this—what do the psychologists call it—guilt complex? You feel you have no right to them, is that it?\" \"T haven't, bishop. It isn't right.\" Dan stood up, clinging tightly to his wife's hand. \"Dick was a better man than I am.\" \"You can't be a judge of that, Dan.\" The bishop laid his hand on the younger man's shoulder. \"We should never question God's wisdom either in the things we suffer or in the things he sees fit to bless us with.\" He placed his other hand on Kathy's shoulder and regarded her RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 kindly. \"Sister Gordon, you need to assure this husband of yours every day that you love him and appreciate him. And you, Dan,\" Dan met the Bishop's gaze squately, \"you thank the Lord every night and every morning for sparing your life and bringing you back to this fine gitl, and for sending you children to rear according to his word.\" «\"Bishop—\" Dan groped for words to thank him. \"Bishop Bentley, you'll never know—\" The good bishop patted his arm. \"You're a splendid couple, you Gordons, and if I might make a suggestion, I'd say you needed a vacation trip right now, just the two of you.\" He turned his smile on Kathy. \"Do you have someone you can leave the children with?\" Kathy raised her eyes to Dan and he put his arm about her waist. \"Linda!\" she exclaimed. \"I know she'd love to. And, oh, Dan, let's go someplace where there's a temple.\" All the love and happiness in her heart glowed radiantly in her face. Op",

    "content": "Our Responsibility to Inactive Members Counselor Velma N. Simonsen [Address delivered at the annual general Relief Society conference in the Tabernacle on Thursday afternoon, September 30, 1948.| HIS is one of the great mo ments of my life to stand in this historic building and, before this great body of Relief Society sisters, bear my testimony to the truthfulness of the gospel and to the blessings of the Relief Society work to the women of the Church, and to the women of the whole world who will accept of its blessings and its opportunities. When Joseph Smith organized the Relief Society he said: \"I now turn the key in your behalf in the name of the Lord, and this society shall rejoice, and knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time henceforth.\" Later on he said if the women would live up to their privileges that the angels could not be restrained from being their associates. When he turned the key he opened the door for such a flood of blessings to flow down upon womankind that it ls beyond our powét to comprehend the greatness of those blessings. There is a French quotation that says: 'Noblesse oblige,\" which might be expressed, \"where much is given, much is €Xpected.\" Yesterday, and especially this morning, we have heard much of the accomplishments of women, and our hearts have rejoiced in this accomplishment. We have given much, but I believe that we have not yet lived up completely to out privileges, that. We have not yet reached the limit of our possibilities, and especially of the possibilities of bringing spiritual awakening to our inactive sisters. One of the charges which the Prophet gave the society later on was to strengthen the communities, and how better can we strengthen out communities than to bring spirituality to the hearts of the mothers im our communities? One of the great est needs in the whole world today | is the need of spirituality. It can be truly said that in the world of science and material things, nevet before has man aimed so_ high, planned so profoundly, or achieved of our forefathers are commonplace realities to never before have been less sure of themselves. Never has there been a been so much cators, Our scientists, Our our own prophets tell us that if the world is to endure at all it must do so by spiritual power. Page 291 292 So, if there is one Latter-day Saint woman in our community who is not receiving of the Strength and the blessings of Relief Society and Relief Society activity in the rearing of her family, we have a responsibility toward her. And how can we Prepare ourselves and make sure that we are equal to this responsibility? First, we ourselves must be sure that we are living according to the standards of the gospel, that we have active membership, and active and loyal participation in the organizations of the Church. That is one of the great spiritual losses of today —lack of loyalty to worthy causes. How many parents do you know who are heartsick over the waywardness of their children? Most Latterday Saint parents are very anxious that their children be active in the Church and, yet, they fail to realize that what they themselves do and what they say, their activity and their disloyalty, are the gteatest factors in governing their children's lives. We of the older generation have had the teachings of faithful parents and grandparents to set an example for us. We may become inactive for a time and drift away, but those teachings have been so strong that they cannot be entirely lost, and we return. But what about these children who have seen only the actions of their disloyal parents? LAST summer President Smith, talking at an open-air meeting in our stake, told the story of a couple who had a fine Latter-day Saint background who became inactive and drifted away from the Church. In later life they realized RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 what they were missing, and came back, but they found that they could not interest their children 'in the Church or its ideals. And, as he said, they could repent, but they could not repent for their children. President Grant once said, \"Wherever you find a woman who ls devoted to the work of the Lord, almost without exception you will find that her children are devoted to it.\" And Brother Ballard in one of his talks said, \"If we live the gospel, there is no power in earth or in hell that can prevail against us. There IS NO power or influence greater than the teachings of a good woman.\" What a promise that is to us who are Tearing our families, and what an incentive to bring the gospel, a spiritual awakening, to our inactive sisters. We must be our sisters' keepers and do all in our power to keep alive in their hearts a love of the gospel and a desire to live by its principles. I hope that each of you sitting here today is saying in your heart, what can I do to encourage my sisters, the women whom | know in my ward who are inactive? Maybe you are saying, \"I wish she would tell us what we can do to teawaken spirituality in the hearts of our inactive sisters.\" In this you may be like the old farmer down in Southern Utah who was approached by a book salesman who tried to interest him in buying a book, but he said, \"Why, what do I want it for?\" And the salesman replied: \"It will teach you how to raise better cattle, how to raise better sheep and better Tops.

    "content": "A Pattern for Christine Dorothy ]. Roberts clear her eyes. 'Two large tears rolled slowly down her smooth cheeks, leaving shining trails and forming two jagged pools on the golden oak of her mother's old pedal sewing machine. Other girls had fathers and mothers for times like this. Christine had never known her father, and now Mama, who had always been so close to her, was gone. The surgeon's knife, which was to have assured Mama, after her years of hardship, the quiet span of peace and abundance she deserved, had somehow failed in its not unaccustomed miracle. \"So unnecessary,\" her brothers had mourmed, with added incentive for their medic studies. Even her brothers were too far away to be reached, Naaman and Don, two promising medical students at school in New York. A girl needed her mother at a time like this, with only a week to go. The tiny garment under the machine needle swam in the mottled sunlight, till she could not distinguish seam from placket. Like a jigsaw puzzle, the pieces still refused to fit, though she had worked so long that the shadow of the tall elm had crept across the lawn and now dappled the dimity before her. A sheet of pattern directions still lay, unfolded, on the table beside her. She squeezed the tears from her eyes again. Only, this time, she looked up at the calendar on the side wall. Its young Madonna cuddled an angelic, pink-frocked child. Below, the page said, June Page 294 (- ra oe blinked hard to 1920, in broad, black print. The days were all crossed off through the 11th. The 19th was outlined with a neat, blue ink line, carefully drawn around the date. 'This was marked over with a bold, red penciled circle, irregularly shaded in ted. At the bottom of the page, an amateurs hand had pnnted, Herm. The calendar, too, wavered before her eyes, being replaced by the picture of Dave, her young husband, booming, \"That little blue line? There's nothing blue about it. Why, honey, it's a red-letter day, biggest in a lifetime! Our first!\" And he had boldly used his red pencil. \"But what'll we call it? Can't be just It; it's part of the family.\" \"Oh, Dave, it's got to be a Her or a Him.\" \"Her or Him Her, Him Herm! That's what we'll call it, Herm. Till the nineteenth of June, then it can be—\" \"Herman Dave\" Christine joined in his enthusiasm. \"Or Hermione Chnistine.\" He picked her up in strong, young arms and laid her gently on the couch, then returned to the calendar and printed Herm, at the bottom of the page. Some of the bitterness spilled out of Christine in two more tears. \"Oh, Mama, Mama!\" 'The small garment before her blurred out of all recognition, and with it the years dissolved, twelve of them. Eee & GHE was seven, Donnie five, Naaman eight, and Mama—oh, A PATTERN FOR CHRISTINE Mama was sweet and gay and kind and ageless. 'They were on the long back porch of their small home in the kindly, country town. The old washer sang rhythmically, \"Kerbump-sp-lash, ker-bump-sp-lash,\" as Naaman swung the lever back and forth, back and forth. Donnie, standing on a crude homemade stool, clung tenaciously to the lever handle, below Naaman's hands. \"What makes you so ambitious?\" asked Naaman, scowling at Donnie's persistence. \"I want to help, too shrilled his reply. Mama swirled more bluing balls through the rinsing water of the tubs between Christine and _ her, then grasped the handle of the old wringer, fastened to the washing bench. She turned slowly, as Christine fed the clothes through from the first tub. \"Oh, Mama, Mrs. Boyne has such pretty pillowslips. Look at this A spray of lilacs grew above the hemline of the slip she held up. \"It's nice to be handy with the needle,\" said Mama. \"Things like that can grow out of idle afternoons and sitting, of an evening. I'm going to start you on that little piece with the French knots the first night I get caught up with my ironing.\" A sputtering noise came from the kitchen as Mama wrung the last piece through. \"The boiler!\" She ran to the stove. \"Naaman, dear, please help Mama out with the boiler.\" With Naaman gone, the dasher, under Donnie's hand alone, almost ceased to turn. Mama and Naaman set the boiler on the porch. Mama lifted the clothes out with \" Donnie 295 a long stick, delightedly. \"They are white today. 'That last batch of soap we made was the nght recipe, at last.\" \"After they're blued, they look pretty as shadows on the snow,\" Christine observed. \"They're beautiful,\" Mama enthusiastically agreed. The washer was rhythmically splashing again. One basketful was ready to hang. \"Mama,\" Naaman glared down at the top of Donnie's head, and rolled his eyes upward suggestively. Mama nodded, and called to him, \"Donnie, would you like to be a man and help Mama hang?\" Donnie left the washer and skipped over to her. \"Let me wear the clothespins.\" She tied the faded embroidered bag around his chest. He reached into the big, bulging pockets and handed her the pins. Christine could hear the spank of the clothes as Mama shook them out smooth. The alarm clock on the bench rang. Christine shut it off. \"T'wenty minutes, Naaman. 'There's only one washerful left.\" \"Lucky day! My arm's stiff.\" \"Well, I'll turn the wringer while you feed.\" \"Say, Chris, I've got a new hiding place for tonight when we play Run, Sheep, Run.\" \"You couldn't have. Tell me.\" \"Can't. The captain might not choose us on the same side. But I've got it all figured out.\" \"Now just the socks.\" Christine gingerly picked up the socks, one at a time, in two fingers, and dropped them into the machine. \"Well, Mrs. Boyne is all cleaned up,\" announced Naaman, and flung 296 himself into the shade of the apple tree at the corner of the porch. \"All clean,\" echoed Donnie, doing the same. Christine rested in the swing, her feet dangling on the cracked ce ment. 'The quiet of their little world and the coolness of the shade enveloped her in the old peace again. Mama soon came out with a basket of clean, ironed clothes. A dish towel was spread across the top and tucked in at the sides. \"Whose is that load, Mama?\" \"Sister Nolte's. And here, Naaman, put Sister Nolte's dollar in this little purse when she pays you, and be sure to snap it closed before you put it into your pocket.\" Then she brought a plate with bread and jam, three pieces. \"And here is a slice each, with my new pottawatomie jam on, for my workmen.\" \"I want the white piece,\" shouted Donnie, helping himself to the top slice. Naaman and Christine put the basket on Naaman's worn wagon, Naaman pulling, and Christine holding the basket steady. When Christine looked back, Donnie was giving Mama a hug. He had the slice in one hand, and the long willow for driving the town cows home from the pasture, in the other. She guessed it was time for Donnie to go; after all, it was a long way to the town pasture, and the shadows were long on the wide, unpaved road before them. She knew it made Donnie feel important to earn his bit that way. T seemed a long, warm trip to Sister Nolte's. \"Hold the gate back farther, Christine, this load's wider than the basket.\" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 They turned the handle, shmilling the doorbell fastened on the middle of Sister Nolte's door. Sister Nolte opened it finally. A pleated white apron edged with lace circled her generous waistline over the maroon alpaca dress with the long sleeves and the immense skirts. Even in June she wore a small, thin, silk-brocaded black shawl around her shoulders. \"Ah, you solla bairn. Come in, come in.\" She patted their heads and smoothed their hair, and helped put the basket on the hall floor. \"Come in the parlor and sit.\" She opened the unused room and a musty odor drifted out. \"We'll sit out under the umbrella tree and wait, Sister Nolte. It's cool out there.\" \"All right, if you want. Right out with the money.\" They sank down under the drooping old tree, their backs against the trunk. Naaman flexed his pocket knife. He flipped it from his elbow, his shoulder, his head. It stood upright in the grass, vibrating. Christine searched the grass for a fourleafed clover. 'The door opened again; a round tray appeared with a large sugar bowl on it made of blue glass with little bubbles here and there, and a wide gold edge and handle. It was heaped with little white cubes of lump sugar. Sister Nolte followed. \"A lilla to speece, maybe?\" She hovered over them. She gave each a heavy, grooved, red glass tumbler. \"It is juice from raspberries and currants, mixed.\" She pressed on them a plate of scalloped cookies with crystallized sugar on top. Pll be A PATTERN FOR CHRISTINE \"Oh, thank you, Sister Nolte.\" \"Now you eat.'\"\" She labored toward the house, calling her husband, \"Lilla Chrestian, betta Chrestian!\"' \"What are the seeds in these cookies?\" asked Naaman. \"They always taste so funny.\" \"She's from the Old Country, Naaman, and I guess she brought them from there. Funny tasting, though. I'm glad: Mama doesn't use them.\" Sister Nolte came out with a great package wrapped in papers. \"The pig's head, freshly killed and cleaned. I am too gammel this year to take care of it. Maybe Mama can make head cheese? And some sausage; here is some sausage. You like sausage, Naaman?\" \"Oh, yes, oh, thank you Sister Nolte.\" \"We had to kill early because of Maria's wedding. Oh, such a big wedding. Ly.\" \"Sister Nolte, Mama is going to give you some of our crab apples for preserves.\" Christine knew the ways of Mama. \"Your Mama iss. Bless Mama's big, brave heart.\" She touched the corner of her eye with her apron. \"And the dollar. And for Donnie.\" She tucked Naaman's pocket full of cookies. Naaman snapped the dollar carefully in the purse and stowed it in his pocket. \"Thank you, Sister Nolte, and goodbye.\" Naaman and Christine each put a knee in the empty wagon and coasted down the hill from the Nolte's. \"Put on the brakes,\" cried Naaman at the base of the hill, dragging his foot. Your The whole town, near-— 297 \"Here's where we spilled Donnie that day,\" giggled Christine. \"And here's where we found the nickel to pacify him. Let's look in the dry ditch; maybe there's another one. I could use some of that candy.\" | Christine remembered the treat of spending the whole nickel. \"One of these and two of those, no, three of those.\" They had pointed through the glass of the wondrous candy counter. \"Oh, well, no luck today.\" Naaman climbed back to the wagon and pushed on across the street. Donnie came around the corner, limping slightly. He swished his willow and the last cow trotted two steps and ambled toward her own corral. \"What happened to your foot, shrimp?\" Donnie shied away from Naaman. \"Nothing. It feels good.\" \"Don't be scared. I've got something for you. A present.\" \"Who from?\" \"From your best girl,\" Christine giggled. \"Who? I haven't got any.\" \"Guess,\" Christine commanded. \"Trudy.\" Donnie dug the dust with his toes. \"Donnie loves Trudy. Donnie loves Trudy,\" Naaman sang. \"Now we know.\" Donnie raised the willow switch threateningly. \"It's from Sister Nolte, Donnie. Give them to him, Naaman.\" Donnie tasted the cookies, disappointed. \"They taste different.\" ATER, Mama prepared the supper soup. They knew what kind it would be. It was always the same.

    "content": "Civil Liberty Today Elder G. Homer Durham Director, Institute of Government, University of Utah T is all too common nowadays | to take civil liberty for granted. Our forefathers could afford no such luxurious attitude. Most of the time, most of the people, in most of the world, have been slaves. Greek democracy at Athens was based on slavery. 'The Roman world knew little freedom so far as the majority of humankind was concerned. 'The nineteenth century, true, saw the expansion of civil liberty for significant, large groups of people, but chiefly in western Europe, the United States, and the British Dominions. Indentured servants and slavery in most western countries are now things of the past. Ownership of human beings has ceased to exist, generally, but new forms of control threaten the freedoms that flowered in the nineteenth century. In order that we of the twentieth century may have some appreciation of our general situation, we might consider the facts that in Virginia, in 1625, forty per cent of the population were indentured servants; that thirty-six per cent of the emigrants to Pennsylvania in the 1680's were bond slaves; that a Maryland statute of 1715 authorized not to exceed ten lashes \"for any one offense'\" committed by these indentured founders of our social structure! After a few years most of these servants became free, acquired property, and established themselves as significant members of society. Slavery, too, flourished in America until the Civil War, numbering, in 1700, about ten per cent of the population. Even among the humanitarian Quakers of Pennsylvania, the lot of the slave was not particularly happy, despite the fact that the leading figures of the abolition movement were eventually numbered among this group. A Pennsylvania statute of 1693 authorized any persons: To take up Negroes, male or female, whom they shall find gadding abroad on the first days of the week without a ticket from their master or mistress... And to take them to jail, there to remain that night, and that without meat or drink, and to cause them to be publicly whipped next morning with 39 lashes, well laid on their bare backs, at which their said master or mistress shall pay 15d. To the whipper (Curtis P. Nettels, The Roots of American Civilization, 1940, page 326). The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Together with the following nine amendments, this provision constitutes the Federal Bill of Rights. These amendments took effect December 15, 1791, some thirty months after the inauguration of George Washington under the new Constitution, framed in 1787, ratified in 1788, and put into effect in 1789.

    "content": "You Might Have Waited Fay Tarlock EEING Miss Tyndale again S was just as Nan Kenny had hoped it would be. Miss Tyndale was coming down the flagstone path from her garden, carrying a tin milk pan heaped with gooseberries, her straw hat tilted back from her perspiring forehead. \"Well,\" beamed Miss Tyndale, her smile deepening the wrinkles in her pleasant face, \"this is the best surprise I've had all summer, and look how you've caught me!\" She hurriedly set the pan of gooseberries on the path and began smoothing her blue and white gingham apron in a deprecatory manner. \"Don't take your apron off, please,\" Nan called as she came through the white picket gate, pushing her small daughter before her. \"Tm going to help you pick the gooseberries.\" Nan laughed an amused laugh. \"It's been so long since I've seen a gooseberry, I'll enjoy doing it.\" Gooseberries, she thought, had become fashionable. Indeed Miss 'Tyndale and her picket gate would make good copy for any garden magazine. Nan stood inside the gate, looking with love on Miss Tyndale's tall, spare, and still erect frame and on her face, beautiful in its intelligence and serenity. She's part of the earth, changeless as the seasons, Nan said to herself. Is it escaping the storms of matrimony that has given her this air of tranquility? No, I've known married people to possess the same thing. And think of Page 302 what some of the unmarried ones look like! Why, she was wondering anew as she started up the flagstone path towards Miss 'Tyndale, has she never married? Sometimes men have no. Sense. The two of them sat on the whiterailed porch. In front of them, and sloping towards the lake, lay the little town, its roofs almost obscured by the summer green. Outside the town were the orchards and fields, lush and rich with the promise of harvest. When a breeze stirred, Nan saw the silver shimmer of the lake beyond the fields. Back of them, and circling the valley, were the mountains, their peaks purple in the afternoon light. Winkie, Nan's toddling daughter, ran shouting on the lawn, stopping now and then to pick a Shasta daisy from the border. \"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" Miss Tyndale asked, more in worship than for confirmation. Her brown, gnarled fingers snapped off the stem and blossom ends of the berries even as she looked. \"There's nothing like it back in New York is there?' She dared Nan to contradict her. \"Nothing,\" sighed Nan blissfully. \"That's why I have to come back every chance I get. I wanted to see this as badly as I wanted to show off my daughter.\" \"VE always felt the same way about this town, even when I was a child, not much older than YOU MIGHT HAVE WAITED Winkie,\" confided Miss Tyndale. She held up a plump gooseberry to the light and polished off a bit of mold with the corner of her blue and white apron. \"And it didn't look the same either,\" she added with one of her deep chuckles. \"I remember when I was about five, standing out in the yard in front of our log cabin. There were none of the shade trees and orchards you see now, just a lot of pigpens and corrals too close to the house. But I thought it was beautiful, the most beautiful place in the world, and that my heart would break if ever I had to leave it.\" She held up another gooseberry, admiring its green perfection. \"I always think,\" she said slowly, \"that more importance should be given to the gooseberry. With us it begins the cycle of the harvest.\" She gave Nan a beseeching smile. \"I'll bet you're wondering how an old lady in her eighties has the temerity to be storing up the fruits of the earth.\" Cutting off Nan's denial, she went on, \"Maybe I haven't sense enough to realize that I'm old. But when I stop preparing for the winter, I'm done for. As long as I can store up for gooseberry pies, I'm still part of the living.\" She scooped up another handful of gooseberries and swiftly snapped off the brown ends. Years before Miss Tyndale had once said, \"The present is far too important to me to waste time dishing out the past.\" But today Nan was hungry for the past and for a more intimate understanding of Miss Tyndale. \"You haven't always lived here on the land, have you?\" she asked. \"T haven't gone too far afield,\" 303 Miss Tyndale answered, her eyes still absorbing the summer beauty with pride of ownership. \"I lived in Provo for a few years, and once I moved to Salt Lake to work in a shop—but that was before you were born.\" She snapped off another stem with sure fingers. \"I've never wanted to live any place but here.\" \"Didn't you mind, when you sold the old house?\" Nan asked the question, hoping it was the right one. \"Not a bit,\" Miss Tyndale assured her, \"as long as I could live on part of the land. You know,\" she confessed, a bit of rue in her smile, \"that as I get older I understand some things better. I do believe that I inherited the Englishman's passionate love for his land. None of my family, not even my father or my brothers born in England, had it as I do.\" <sTF you had been truly English you'd still be living in the old house,\" Nan said nodding to the big, white painted stone house set in a grove of trees a quarter of a mile away from the cottage. \"No, I'm_ typically American,\" Miss Tyndale declared, a suspicion of conceit in her tone. \"I like a raw new. Home with beautiful shining plumbing. But you should see what they've done with the old house.\" She waved a gooseberry in the air, © her eyes bright with interest. \"They spent a fortune remodeling it so that it looks like a gentleman's estate. But me, I'm glad to be rid of the old fireplaces and big, cold upstairs.\" \"Yes, you're thoroughly American,\" Nan teased her. \"You have to 304 have everything electric and new.\" She looked through the open doorway to the familiar living room. It seemed unchanged from the last visit. On the floor were the rugs Miss Tyndale had hooked; the pioneermade secretary was still stuffed with New York Sunday Times; the bookcase with the glass doors shielded the books she wanted to read but seldom did. There was the serving table Miss Tyndale had made from a picture frame and the deep leather chair that had been her father's. Through the rear door Nan could see the electric refrigerator and stove, next to the drop-leaf table made of early Utah pine. \"You're English,\" Nan decided, loath to leave the subject. \"You're the reserved type.\" \"Not reserved, shy,\" Miss Tyndale corrected her. \"Why once when I was a child Mother sent me over to Mortenson's to borrow something, and do you know what I did?\" Nan shook her head. \"When I got into the house, they asked me to sit down. I sat down so frightened I forgot what I came for. At noon when they set the table for dinner they invited me to eat. I knew I should go home, but I didn't know how to refuse. After dinner I went back to my chair. I guess I'd be sitting there now if Mother hadn't sent an older brother after 97 me. Miss Tyndale's face was momentarily sad, as if after all these years the gaucheries of the child still troubled her. \"I can't imagine your being that shy.\" Nan moved closer to share the same bowl for her cleaned berries. She felt close to Miss TynRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 dale in spirit and wondered if now was the moment to ask her the question she had long wanted answered. She was aware that the moment might not come again. EPIDN'T you, when you were a girl, ever want to leave this?\" she extemporized, moving her hand in an all-inclusive gesture. \"I can understand now why it would satisfy, but when I was younger it didn't mean a thing.\" Miss 'Tyndale's hands were still for the first time, her voice very quiet as she said, \"\"That's one of the reasons I've always admired you, Nan. You weren't afraid to go away on your own. You made a place for yourself and found what you wanted in a strange world. Now, look what you've got.\" She gestured towards Winkie, busily engaged in stripping a hollyhock. \"Of course I wanted to go,\" she replied, coming back to Nan's question, leaving the gooseberries still idle in her lap, \"but I didn't know how to do it.\" \"You should have married someone who would take you away.\" Nan did her best to give her words a casual sound. \"It would have been easy then.\" Resuming her work, Miss Tyndale smiled. \"I don't believe I ever thought of it like that. Anyway, I'd have had to come back sooner or later.\" She settled comfortably back in her chair and indulged in another of her deep chuckles, \"Come to think of it, I might have gone away. I almost had a chance.\" It was hard for Nan to keep from crowding the edge of her chair. (Continued on page 353)",

I felt almost as if I were walking on holy ground when I walked through the large board meeting room and viewed the oil portraits of the women who had started and carried forward this service to humanity, as it is still being done. They were women of courage and vision and as each has handed the torch of leadership on to her followers, the same inspiration has been carried along, so that it touches the spirit of even a visitor such as I was. And so I said to myself, what can I tell these women of volunteer services? It is for me rather to learn from them. However, it is true that the Field Army of the American Cancer Society has a splendid record of service to humanity also, and for reasons of information, it is with pleasure that I set down a few of these accomplishments. The American Cancer Society was organized in 1913 by doctors and scientists, with a few laymen, who, motivated by the same unselfish spirit of the great doctors of our nation, wanted to make a concerted effort against the scourge of cancer. 'They began by surveys, pooling their knowledge, developing a program to increase medical facilities, and to further educate their profession in the nature of this disease. By 1936, they had a very good record of accomplishment, having developed facilities from about thirteen approved hospitals to over 300 approved hospitals and clinics. The great need now was to bring the public up-to-date on the knowledge and information which had been approved by the American Medical Association. 'There was no money for an educational program. The women of the nation were called upon to organize the Field Army for the purpose of educating the public. It was almost a hopeless task, for ignorance, superstition, and fear filled the minds of many people until few were even willing to listen to the program' of education or to read the available literature. The accomplishment of these women of courage, vision, and energy should be a matter of pride to all women. In ten years time, the attitude of the public toward the disease has changed greatly. Today magazines, newspapers, radio stations, etc., are co-operating to get the message to Mr. And Mrs. Average Citizen that \"early cancer may be cured, through surgery, X-ray, radium;\" to teach them the necessity of complete, periodic health examinations and to go to their family physician at once when any of the \"seven danger signals\" Page 305 This jg a notable feat in the field f Cati e that we SUN our work O tch that oy; Nation has ever known jg seekin Tecent SUIVEy Te the Causes of Cancer, new Means of veals that Only half of the Popula- 'A8NOsing jt, and additional] meth 10n of M€nca can 'Me a single o S of Curing it, Jy Is g Program early symptom of Cancer, that anyone May be proud to sup.

Layton Member, General Board of Relief Society and Chairman, Work Meeting Committee ORK meeting leaders should begin planning their next season's (1949-50) work meeting program now. Each leader is aware of the needs and interests of the women with whom she is working and should, at this time, be able to make general plans for an appropriate program which will accomplish the purposes of the Rehef Society work meeting in her locality. Activity on this day should be planned with the following purposes in view: 1. To enable the women to give service in the Church Welfare Plan by assisting in filling the Welfare clothing budget assignment. 2. To give service to the ward Relief Society organization by participating in activities beneficial to the local society. 3- To foster and develop creative and homemaking skills. 4. To promote a feeling of friendly sociability within the group by working together in pleasant association. Each of these purposes should be considered fully in programming the day's activities in order that the greatest possible good may be gained from the meeting. Our first obligation on this day is to fill the Welfare clothing budget assignment. In doing this, we must be governed by the directions given us by the Welfare committee when the assignment is made. Let us plan to allow all the women an opportunity to participate in this service, that all may obtain the satisfaction and the development which come from so doing. Next, we should anticipate the local activities of our society for the year and include the preparation for these in our season's planning. If we contemplate a bazaar, let us plan ways to use this activity to forward the purposes of the work meeting. Through a bazaar we can interest our members and bring them into activity; we can recognize the skills of some of our older women and ask them to teach these skills to others; we can plan to use everyone along the lines of her aptitudes, interests, and skills. Special activities may be featured on various work meeting days, which will stimulate interest in homemaking and home beautification. The sewing course, which will be outlined in the July issue of the Magazine, may well be brought into the work meeting. Many of our mothers have need of this special instruction, and it may be given in such a manner as to interest the entire Relief Society group when it does not interfere with other planned activities. Fine quilting has become traditional in Relief Society. Let us plan to carry on this tradition by helping all to have an opportunity to learn and practice this skill.

It originated last September when women were depressed because they had \"nothing to wear\" to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Wilhelmina's reign. They make patchwork skirts from the \"odds and ends\" in their workbaskets. These symbolize \"salvaging bits of the past and uniting them in a new future\" of national progress and world-wide understanding. T the end of the last war, Dr. James R. McCain, for thirty years president of Agnes Scott College for Women, in Georgia, said that when future generations read our contemporary history, the headlines will be, not the two wars, but the women's revolution of the past fifty years. He feels that the results of women's business, professional, and political activities have been more harmful than good for society as a whole. He feels that women working when there are more applicants than jobs will bring down all wages. He blames the increase in juvenile delinquency and the decrease in birthrate on mothers' absence from home. It is the",

    "content": "A Measuring Rod for Growth Blanche B. Stoddard Member, Relief Society General Board [Address delivered at the annual general Relief Society conference in the Tabernacle, Thursday afternoon, September 30, 1948.| HIS morning we had a wonderful demonstration of the growth of our building fund which will make possible the realization of a great Relief Society dream. For a moment this afternoon, I would like to speak of a measuring rod for our own individual growth, the following of which may make it possible for us to realize some of our dreams., We have a beautiful song which says: \"I know that my Redeemer lives, and because he lives, I, too, shall live again.\" 'The sacrifice of Jesus has ensured the resurrection. We shall literally live again. But his coming has brought to us another kind of living, a rich, full, abundant living that we do not have to wait to enjoy in some hereafter. Before the tme of Jesus the old Mosaic Law was in effect, \"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\" but Jesus brought us the greater law of love, of tolerance, and forgiveness. He gave us the key for this rich, abundant life, and his gospel is highly practical. It is something that we can put into our daily lives and really live, and it is a strange thing, is it not, that we hold to perfection in obedience to natural law. We just take for granted that if we obey certain laws we get certain results. But we do not always do that in regards to this great law of love. Page 364 For instance, if I want to bake a cake, I must have certain ingredients and certain proportions, and if I skimp or leave out one I do not get a good cake. My husband is a builder. If he wants good concrete he must have cement, sand, and water, and if he leaves out any of these he has not good concrete. If you want to send a special delivery letter you must have a thirteen-cent stamp, a tencent stamp is not enough. If we want a pound we must have sixteen ounces; fourteen will not do. And it is said that one-thousandth of an inch variation in the building of an engine shaft will cause enough friction to ruin it. O, do I fool the oven with short measure recipes? Does my husband fool the sun with short measure concrete? Do we fool the laws of harmony when we play false notes? We fool only ourselves. Then why can we not accept this same procedure in following exactly and completely this great law of love which encompasses all others? Why cannot we take for our formula of life: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,\" a formula just as exact and scientific as any other? To solve it does not entail great sacrifice or noble and heroic deeds, just the will to live from day to day with A MEASURING ROD FOR GROWTH the happiness of others as our goal, and in reaching it we will find our own greatest happiness. So let us take that formula for our measuring rod and as the years go by, at intervals let each of us ask himself, have I grown in love this past year? Is it easier for me to love all men, all classes, all nations? Am I as kind in my home and thoughtful as I could be? Can I tell those I love that I do love and appreciate them? Or, is it too much bother? Am I as kind in my judgment as I ought to be? And it seems to me, sisters, this last is a keynote for our happiness, to be kind in our judgment of each other. It is said that we judge other people by their actions; ourselves by Our intentions, and that is not fair, is it? If we were willing to judge other people by their intentions we could never judge, because we cannot possibly know what is in another's heart. One day my little daughter came running into the house and said, \"Mother, Joyce says I am spoiled.\" And I said, \"Well, Judy, I have heard you say a dozen times that Joyce is spoiled.\" She did not answer for a second or two and then she said, \"Well, but she is.\" A fine old English convert moved into one of our wards a few years ago and had been there but a short time when the bishop asked him to take charge of the sacrament table for the following month. He was so thrilled to think that he was worthy, but some of the sisters in the ward went to the bishop and said: \"This man is not worthy to handle the sacrament. He smokes.\" 365 He had been a heavy smoker all of his life but now he had joined the Church and he was trying so hard, and these women did not know what his wife knew. Day after day she would see him out in his garden down upon his knees with the tears streaming down his face, praying for strength to leave the cigarette alone. He had conquered and he was worthy, but they did not know it. When we moved to Salt Lake a number of years ago we lived next door to a sister who held a very high position in the Church, but she did not go to sacrament meeting. She did not go to Relief Society meeting. She did not visit the poor and the needy. She did not do any of the things I thought she should in the position she held. It seemed to me she just rocked on her front porch day after day, and I was quite free in my criticism of her. But I awakened one morning to find that she had died in the night with cancer that I knew nothing about. That is why she could not do the things she wanted to do. So let us be kind in our judgments of each other. EMEMBER this morning in the closing",

What makes a poem? Chiefly emotion and originality (that originality inherent in personality, which is the only originality since Eve), clothed in appropriate and effective words and arranged in a form suitable to the subject. Suppose we want to write a poem, what do we seek first? The idea with the poet's personality attached to it, what she feels and thinks about a particular situation, circumstance, heartbreak, or other experience. How do we go about it? We con it over very close to our hearts, letting it stir and grow from the very depths of our beings, thinking, utterly alone, far removed in thought from surroundings, people, and things, until the idea is rooted and sprouting. The chances are that it will somehow know whether to be an oak or a maple, just as a seedling does. I let a poem take its form from the emotion it rouses in me and hope that it will stir my readers to feel what I am feeling. But if it does not choose the proper form, it is a cripple and will not produce the desired effect. Some poets build poems with a conscious choice of form to fit the emotion they expect to arouse. If you choose your form, then do it surely. In order to do this you must make yourself a master of form. Any good rhyming dictionary carries a chapter or two on meter, forms, and patterns, with a discussion of what scholars have learned about their use and effects on readers. Also, any poet who wishes to increase the quality and effectiveness of her work should provide herself with a good basic textbook on poetry writing and should study it diligently. All of us have poetic ideas, but we must learn to express these ideas in a way which will be understandable and pleasing to others. A technical training is just as essential for poetry as it is for music or painting or sculpture or any of the other arts. Practice in following the various forms and patterns of poetry will make them so much a part of you that they will be waiting inside to come when you need them. Many poems appeal because of their form and rhythm which make the reader feel the sensation the poet wishes to portray. Activities such as swinging, flying, rowing, walking, have inherent rhythms. Poems need portray no very deep philosophy if they stir the reader with emotion and memories. Many poets object to strict forms in poetry as a hindrance to thought processes, but I find form an aid to good results. It furnishes the music which is the chief agent in stirring emotion and it disciplines the poet to choose her words carefully. In order to fill the form to its fullest Page 371 372 capacity a poet must think deeply and prune conscientiously. 'This makes for better thinking, deeper feeling, and so, of course, for better poetry. However, if a poet lazily fills in lines with wordage like lumpy cotton batting, the poem will be loose and the form will show through above the idea and will make a bad poem. Careless and uninspired work is always bad. It is not the form, but the poet's hitching a ride on the form, which hurts a poem. MAGERY is another aid to a poet, giving her a chance to paint a picture, stir an appropriate emotion, and put a profound concept into a concrete form which might have been ponderous and have fallen unheeded without this path to the heart. 'Take this from \"Between Seasons\": He who alone stands watching summer go Southward on wings and earthward in a leaf Feeling all time in one relentless flow, Longs for a portion he may hold in brief. Here you see the man standing out beneath the sky, the leaves falling, the migrant geese flying, and feel the swift passage of summer and youth. You long with him to grasp a portion to hold in your hand a little longer as proof that you had it, but feel the futility, with time slipping farther and farther away. Or take: When I consider that a century Has gone as windswept appleblossoms go Here you tie the passing of a hundred years to a common experience of the here and now. Allusions help to stir memories and say much in few words, as: RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 Denied the Star, the Mount, the Fatal || Here the life of Christ is referred to by the sign of his birth, the star, the Mount of Olives, and Calvary Hill where his sacrifice was consummated. Now let's take up a few of the dont's of poetry writing. Don't invert for the sake of rhyme. An inversion is a change in the natural order of word arrangement. In conversation we might say: The birds flew south. But the amateur poet might say: South flew the birds. This would be an inversion. To invert in order that a word or phrase may be given added emphasis for a purpose is good, but to turn a sentence inside out like a schoolboy's sweater just to make rhyming easy shows laziness or thoughtlessness and puts the work on the reader. Inversions were never good form. Poets have used inversions because people like to hear rhymes, and by inverting a line a poet could get words that were easy to rhyme and saved the effort of finding harder ones. There was a time when few readers objected to inversions and therefore poets did not bother to eradicate these faults in composition. However, times have changed, and we must now strive harder, or we shall be left behind. We have a much more widely read and exacting audience today. The more sensitive the reader, the more he will appreciate good workmanship, and the more quickly he will be offended by careless composition. Always reach for the best in your readers. Contractions, also, are character- POINTS FOR POETS TO REMEMBER istic of amateurish and _ carelessly written poetry. Don't say o'er for over, because such uses are tricks to make the meter come out even, and tricks may be fun, but they are never honest, and poetry must be sincere. The same thing is true of e'er for ever, 'neath for beneath, tis for it is, and many other contractions that are not in accepted usage today. 'There was a time when it was the style for meter to dominate the idea in popular poetry, but that style became obsolete long ago, and it shows a sort of artificiality that is displeasing to discriminating readers today. Poetry is very close to human hearts and a vital means of communication; it should be both direct and sincere. \"Poeticisms\" and old-fashioned words and expressions like ere and yesteryear should be avoided. If you would not use a word in a letter to a friend or in intimate conversation, the chances are that it will sound false in a poem, too. This doesn't tefer, of course, to words in a wider vocabulary than one usually employs in speech, only to style. Many carefully written poems need revision for strengthening weak phrases or lines or for smoothing sounds and freshening imagery. A real craftsman cares enough for her poem to tear it phrase from phrase and put it back together, like a good watchmaker repairing a fine watch. 373 I like to feel that my poems are true, not only in general, but in every part, having no false word or untrue analogy to mar the truth. Sometimes critics are mistaken because they lack specific information or interpret experiences differently, but a poet can develop the ability to hear an inner bell that rings when the truth is sounded and reject the comments and criticisms that do not help. If some word or phrase in one of my poems offends a sensitive reader, I can usually dive back under and come up with something that pleases both of us and have a stronger poem for the revision. But if a change does not ring as true to me as the original, I would not change it to suit the greatest critic I know. The poet is the final judge. \"To thine own self be true Thou canst not then be false...\" be it a poem or anything else you wnite.

    "content": "On Writing a Short Story Fay Tarlock Graduate, Pulitzer School of Journalism, Columbia University HERE are many reasons why writers who are eligible should enter the Relief Society short story contest. Three of you who enter' will receive prizes and an abiding satisfaction. A few of you will discover that you like to write, a rich reward in itself. But the greatest good, perhaps, is that each entrant will have sat down and persevered until she has written a finished product. Writing a short story is a contest in tenacity. Whoever writes one has won in the struggle. In addition to this the writer has also gained a keener appreciation for the art of short story writing. Once you decide to enter the contest, get busy on your story. The idea may come from an incident in your childhood, from some mannerism of a friend, a newspaper clipping, or something that happened down the street last week. Within yourself you have characters to people. A thousand and one stories. Find the incident that will kindle the spark of interest in one of your familiar characters, and you have the germ of a story. One successful writer advises that a beginning author write only of the stuff of his daydreams. We all have secret longings. Is there one so strong in you that you desire to bring it out and give it to a character in a story? If so, you will have a real emotional interest in the character. Another writer says that the underlying idea of your story must Page 374 be that of a widely known human experience, whether it be the general rule or the exception that is as true as the generality. What you are, your fundamental beliefs and principles, will guide your writing, even when you are least aware of it. Draw from your own resources. Success did not come to Kathryn Forbes until she wrote I Remember Mama. When you have chosen your story, make certain in your mind that your choice is right for The Relief Society Magazine. You may know the Magazine well enough not to need to review the stories published in the last dozen or so issues. If you don't, read the stories carefully. Remember you are writing for a widely scattered audience of women, bound by common ideals. Your story need not be didactic. Indeed it should not preach. Let your characters be the moral force that you wish to convey. A good way of beginning is to get the material down and break it up into a rough chart, then build up to a definite climax. Sometimes an outline helps. Who is character A? What is he going to do? What about characters B and C? What are their intentions? Now write your beginning. On page one you should reveal what the story is about. Think of your material in terms of happenings. Any stimulus that does not promise some kind of con- ON WRITING A SHORT STORY flict is not a good one. When you have found a good opening situation that promises conflict, you have the beginning of your story. Don't try to tell everything in the first few paragraphs. Use little flashbacks to give the who, what, when, where, and why. Begin your story as near the end as possible. Set your characters in the beginning and let them tell the story. Description is always a form of characterization and you have only a few words to use. Don't make the mistake of telling too much about your character. Let him show himself through his words and actions. For the moment, become the character you are trying to convey. Look him in the face until you know the texture of his skin, the set of his mouth. Use his gestures, listen to him talk. How does he walk? Even if you have to shout to yourself, be your character long enough to get the feel of him. Back to your story. Arouse the reader's curiosity in the first sentence, if possible. Every happening in your story should have a good premise. Don't forget that a common device is to have the actor fail at first. With each failure he finds himself more deeply involved. Every complication must be planted, subtly. Then comes the black moment, then a new situation that has already been planted, and presto, the end. RITE your story while it is still afire in your mind. If possible, write it all at one sitting. Revise the first time for deleting unnecessary parts and fitting the parts closer together. Don't worry if your 375 first version is twice too long. You can cut and polish. When you have the story in workable shape, the events interlapping, the characters consistent, begin revising for sentence structure. You can console yourself with the fact that the greatest stylists of the ages have agreed upon the difficulty of writing a good sentence. As you revise, remind yourself that you have. Only three thousand words, at best, to use. Try making five words do the work of ten. Watch the adjectives. 'Too many of them can ruin any story. After superfluous adjectives, come the omnipresent connectives and _ sentences loaded with clauses. At the same time you are revising for words, keep in mind the sound of your sentences and making clear your meaning. You may have your story written and yet have a whole page of necessary facts you must insert. In time, you will take an interest in writing for its own sake. Your writing will begin to have smoothness and even beauty. One of the best ways to detect flaws in reasoning and in diction is to read your story aloud—to a trusted person or to yourself alone. You will find sentences that would make you blush if you were to see them printed. Begin wnting your story several weeks, or longer, before the end of the contest and give yourself a cooling period. Let your manuscript rest for a few days, or a few weeks. 'Then take it up and work it over. Many of those troubling situations will resolve themselves. Most writers meditate long on their stories before they are set on paper. 'Think of your characters as 376 you go about your daily work. The right dialogue may come while you are washing the dishes. At all times keep small sheets of paper and pencil handy. Don't rely on your memory to give you the phrase you conjured in the dark. It has to be written down at the moment. Before you start to revise, surround yourself with writers' tools. A good dictionary comes first. With it, should be a number of books on word study. By all means have a handbook of good usage and perhaps a textbook of English grammar. Writers have nothing new to write; it is the saying of it that must be new. The tool books are used more by professionals than by amateurs. Ask yourself these questions: RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 1. Does the reader know what my story is about? 2. Is its underlying theme timely and provocative? 3. Have I created a single impression? 4. Do my characters seem real? 5. Is there suspense? 6. Have I aroused worthy emotions? If you can answer yes, you have done a good piece of work. Reference Books Preparing the Manuscript, by Udia G. Olsen, $1.25. Story Writing, by Edith R. Mirnelees, — ene Fiction Writing, by D.

    "content": "Young Hearts Are Fragile Olive W. Burt HE superintendent of the Children's Aid Society was very kind. Martha felt that kindness spreading out from the calm gray eyes and the gentle mouth above the strong chin, spreading out and enveloping her like a bland ointment on her hurt heart. \"T''m sorry, Mrs. Lewis,\" the quiet voice was saying. \"I recognize your need and it is a very real and urgent one. But,\" she hesitated and then went on firmly, \"please try to understand our position. Our concern is first of all for the children in our care. 'They need homes and love, yes; but they need more than just that. 'They need to live out their destinies—\" Martha stared at the woman. What was she trying to say? What was the message behind her words? Was she intimating that she and Bill would not let the child live out his destiny? That was absurd. Why, they would do everything in their power to improve and enrich that destiny! They would give him everything Danny had had—Danny— The superintendent — glanced down at the filled out forms on her desk. \"Your son was an only child, Mrs. Lewis. He was a wonderful boy—a shining, golden personality. And he died as he had lived, brilliantly —a hero.\" Martha felt the rent in her heart aching again as it always ached when Dan was mentioned. It was a tender ache, a proud ache, for Dan had been more than they said. He had well earned every tribute given him. But there was something lacking in the speaker's voice. She spoke of Dan calmly, honestly, but without that tinge of envy that crept involuntarily into most women's voices when they spoke of Martha's son. It was almost as if she didn't think that being a hero was so much. \"You would find our little boys are not like your Dan. Not one of them, I think.\" Of course not! Martha thought. There is no one in the world like Dan. \"But we'd do our best to make him—\" Martha began, and was stopped by the coldness that froze the smile on the superintendent's lips. That is what we feared, Mrs. Lewis. You and Mr. Lewis have an ideal in your hearts — an ideal no child could equal in your estimation. We do not want to place these children in situations that will make for unhappiness for them— and for you, too; but, mainly, we are concerned with the children. No, I am afraid that, desperately as these children need the homes that have been denied them, we must reject your application.\" Martha could not believe the words. Reject their application! There was something wrong here. She stood up, angry, suspicious. \"Is there something I have neglected,\" she asked cruelly, \"a preliminary bonus?\" Page 377 378 A faint flush rose with difficulty in the clear cheeks of the superintendent, who also rose. But her voice was still calm and quiet. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I am afraid there is something you have neglected, Mrs. Lewis, to put the child's need before your own.\" She gathered up the papers with a gesture that dismissed Martha, and, trembling with anger and hurt as if she had been slapped, Martha turned and hurried out of the room, down the dim hall, and into the street. Bill would hear about this. Bill would do something! Half-blinded by the sunlight, Martha stumbled actoss the street to the comforting green of a doll-sized park against the gray of pavement and buildings. She sat down on a bench, shaking with anger and disappointment, and watched the children playing around her, only half-seeing their bright, fluttering figures, only halfhearing their tinkling voices. It was going to be terrible, telling Bill this. She couldn't make him understand, because she didn't understand, herself, what was wrong. Maybe she would if she thought about it awhile. She hadn't understood about the little baby, either, at first. Probably her perception had been dulled by her sorrow, because before Dan's death she had been quick enough to catch and interpret innuendoes. T had been hard to persuade Bill that they should adopt a baby to take a tiny measure of the empty space left in their hearts with Dan's going. 'Their hearts had been so full when Dan was there—his sturdy masculinity demanding so much, his RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 ardent love of life filling them, completing them, spilling out of their hearts into affection for his playmates, his schoolmates, his buddies, his girl friends. There had been no emptiness then, At last, Bill, seeing her need, had said, \"Of course, honey, if that's what you want. But a baby will be hard work—and you're not as young as you were when Dan was little. And I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, too. But if you want to try it—\" With no more encouragement than that, she had gone to the baby placement bureau and applied for a child. \"We want a boy—a husky, blond, athletic type,\" she had stipulated, feeling that they would enjoy the child more if he resembled Danny. If Bill could teach him to fish and swim and play football and _baseball, he might forget, just a little, what he had lost. She had filled out the proper forms. She had been eager at the interviews. She had spoken freely of their hopes and plans and of what they would do for the baby. \"We can give him everything he needs or wants,\" she had said, not boasting, but hoping to impress the authorities. \"We have a lovely farm—we haven't gone there for two years, but the lease is soon up. We can take the baby there—give him a pony—our Danny loved his pony and was a wonderful rider—\" The woman had asked once, \"Would you consider a girl baby?\" and Martha had hesitated. She, herself, would love a little girl, but Bill —it would be difficult enough for a boy to take Dan's place. How YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE could a girl fit in? She had managed to convey this to the matron, who seemed to understand. But in the end it hadn't mattered, for it turned out that there was a tule against giving tiny babies to couples as old as Martha and Bill. She had been surprised. Somehow, she had thought any agency would be glad to give a baby to them, who could do so much for it. Their own boy had been an example of their fitness as parents—Dan, gay, eager, well-adjusted, healthy. But after she thought about it awhile she could see that they were right. She had never thought of herself or Bill as old, but they were centainly not young—and it had been a long time since Dan had been a baby. Maybe they would find it difficult to cope with a lively little fellow. Martha's problem was to explain this to Bill in such a way as not to hurt him, in such a way as to leave the path open for some other solution. HEN the time came, she couldn't tell whether Bill was relieved or disappointed. 'There were so many things about Bill that she couldn't understand nowadays. They were in some ways so much closer together, so much more dependent upon each other for happiness and companionship. And yet there was an invisible wall between them—a wall of fearfulness lest one hurt the other. Then Bill had said carefully, \"A little baby might not have been such a good idea after all. But perhaps we could get an older child. I understand there's some society that finds homes for older children.\" That had convinced her. Bill was counting on this, too, to ease 379 the hurt that grew more and more terrifying as the empty weeks went \"She had looked up the society Bill had mentioned and had made application there. She had been excited when she returned home after the preliminary interview, when she had seen the children in their classrooms. \"Oh, Bill! I'm sure this is better. We can see what they are like— we can find one that just suits us. They are so nice, the people in charge. They say it's important that the child suits us and that we suit the child. We'll find one that likes skiing and tennis. He can have Dan's room, and Dan's trophies and cups will give him an ideal to live up to.\" And then, after all, their application had been denied! Slowly, feeling every one of her forty years like a separate burden upon her, Martha rose from the bench and walked slowly home to the empty apartment, emptier now, since she had dreamed of it filled with blond and boisterous youth. When she told Bill that night after dinner about the agency he took it more calmly than she had hoped. He reached out for her hand as she stood before him, hurt and angry, and drew her down onto his lap, cuddling her, making a child of her in his utter need. \"They're right, honey,\" he said huskily. \"It wouldn't work out for us. For some folks, yes, but not for us. We've had the best—\"' his voice faltered. After a moment he went on, \"You can't tell what they're like —even a kid of six or seven. He might look like Dan—a little—but 380 what if he turned out to be stupid, or a coward? I'd hate having him around.\" Martha leaned against him, comforting him, but the shadowy wall between them was thick and impenetrable. And _ before them stretched long, empty, futile years of remembering. Bill set her from his knees and rose and began to walk restlessly about the room. Before long he said, as he said so frequently of late, \"Tve got to get out for a few minutes. Do you want to go for a walk?\" Weary as she was, she nodded silently, and they went down onto the street, quiet in the shadows and solitude of the night. They began to walk—to walk until they could return home, physically _ tired enough to sleep. URING these walks Martha felt nearer to Bill. Here they walked silently, with no pretense at gaiety or at casualness. 'The poplars whispered above their heads and from open windows scraps of music floated out. But they were alone and unobserved, even by each other. There was no conscious direction to their steps, and neither one knew just where they were, when a sudden noise recalled them from their world of shadows. They were approaching a square, official-looking building, with a lighted globe above the doorway. At the curb, opposite the door, a knot of men and boys were leaving cars, and it was the scuffling among these that had caught their attention. \"What's happening, Bill?\" Martha asked, trying to reidentify herself with the real world around her. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 Bill glanced up at the building and understood at once. \"This is the police station,\" he said. \"Looks as if some kids are being rounded up.\" \"Kids?\" she asked. She stared at the group moving across the sidewalk; at the officers, big and husky with guns at their hips, and at the boys, dragging back, hitching their bodies as far as they dared, their boldness brought to a sharp edge by the hone of fear. \"Oh, Bill! What have they done?\" Bill shrugged. \"Stolen a car, maybe. Or snatched a purse. Or broken into a cigar store. No telling what a kid will do.\" Suddenly, right in front of them, one of the boys, the very smallest one in the group, gave a quick twitch to his shoulder, broke from the policeman's grasp, and darted past them down the street. The officer yelled and started in pursuit. Martha wanted to put out her foot and trip the officer. She wanted to, but she didn't. She just stood there, watching. And in a moment the officer came back, panting, dragging the boy with him. \"BILL\" Martha whispered, \"can we go in? Can we find out what they've done and what will be done with them?\" Bill looked at her. \"It won't be fun,' he said. \"They're probably a tough little gang. We'd better move on and let the law handle this.\" \"Tm not going to interfere, but I've got to see, Bill. I couldn't sleep if I didn't.\" | They followed the group inside the station and to the booking YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE sergeant. Martha stood just inside the doorway, holding Bill's arm, her eyes searching for the little fellow who had almost got away. He stood with the others, but apart from them, a skinny, dirty little youngster in soiled levis and a ragged shirt. The belt around his middle was drawn tight, and Martha felt like crying at the tiny girth of leather, as if there were not much more than backbone to circle. His eyes were downcast, and Martha found herself wondering what the eyes would be like, and wishing the child would raise his lashes so she could see. As she watched, he did raise his eyes and looked towards her, and there was no miracle there. Their brown irises seemed opaque, so that Martha could not see into them at all, could not read what went on behind them. Instead of being disappointed with this, Martha felt sad, as if it were somehow her fault. She began to listen to what was being said in the room, and had no difficulty in discovering that this was a band of juvenile car plunderers for whom the police had been hunting a long time. One of the boys, a youngster of about fourteen, seemed to be the leader. The little fellow who had tried to get away wouldn't talk when they spoke to him, wouldn't give his name, so the leader spoke up for him. \"He won't tell nobody his name,\" he said. \"Call him Skinny. Skinny Jones will do.\" He shrugged. \"He's kinda dumb, someways, but he's little and quick—\" So they make use of him, Martha thought angrily. She turned to Bill. \"What will be done with them?\" 381 \"They'll get hold of all the parents they can. Some of the boys will probably be taken out to the boys' home on South State. 'Tomorrow they'll investigate more thoroughly. Some will be sent to the State reformatory—\" \"But if that little fellow won't tell his name—\" \"They'll get it. Don't worry.\" | iene then Skinny raised his arm and wiped his nose with one long swipe of his ragged shirt sleeve, his brown eyes wide and hard and unwavering. The pitiful inadequacy and helplessness of that gesture caught Martha's heart and twisted it tight. \"Let's get along,\" Bill said, but Martha stood still. \"Wait, Bill. Wait.\" When the boys had been taken out of the room, Martha stepped up to the sergeant's desk. \"What about a little fellow like that—Skinny?\" she asked, absurdly anxious to know that things would be all right with him. The sergeant looked down at her and smiled. His eyes were gray and kind with little crow's feet to humor at the corners. \"Don't worry about him, ladv. We'll take care of him.\" \"But you don't even know his name—or his mother—\" \"It won't be hard to find. He'll talk before morning—they all do when they're caught for the first time, even when they're as tough as that kid.\" \"Tough?\" Tough enough to keep his eyes dry, but not his nose! \"Look, lady,\" the sergeant said, \"they're a tough gang, and he's tough or he wouldn't last ten min- 382 utes with them. His mother you ask about is probably tough, too. We have 'em every night—kids like this. During the war their dads went gallivanting off to big war plants and their mothers went out to grab off some of the big money that was floating around. The kids had to shift for themselves. And we knew that's the way it was, and hoped it would soon be over. \"But now many of those dads don't want to come back and pick up their old jobs and old families again; and the mothers don't hanker after working at home for nothing. So they chase whatever moncy they can find, and the kids are still left to get along as best they can. They've had half a dozen years now to grow tough in, and believe me, lady, they can't be handled like the kids you're used to knowing. Surprisingly Bill spoke up. \"Isn't there something that we could do, officer? Don't you parole these kids to reputable families?\" The sergeant smiled. \"] haven't seen many reputable families asking for them,\" he said. Then he nodded. \"Yeah, that's the theory—but who wants to take in a kid like that? Listen, you folks don't know the score. Go home and forget it. Or if you can't forget it, if you really want to do something, come back tomorrow and talk to the captain.\" They went out into the street, Martha clinging to Bill's arm. \"T don't want him to stay there a single night,\" she whispered, tears choking her. \"And of course when his mother knows—\" \"The sergeant's right about her, probably,\" Bill said, and went on RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 thoughtfully, \"but that kid isn't bad—yet. You know, I got in a jam like that once—\" They walked along in silence, Martha waiting to hear, knowing that Bill had never told her this because, though it had been of tremendous importance to him at the time, there had never been a place for it in their life together. VEAH,\" he said at last, \"I got m with a gang that stripped light fixtures from empty homes. They called my mother and she I wish you could have seen her. Some of the mothers came weeping and wringing their hands as if their kids were ruined for life. Some came down swearing at the cops as if their kids had done nothing at all, mother came down, calm and quiet \"She talked to me, not the cops, and she made me do my own talk. Ing to them. I don't know how to explain the way I felt—ashamed of myself for what I'd done, but proud of my mother and proud to be man enough to own up and take my medicine. And I was determined I'd never get into a mess like that again,\" After a long time he said, \"Skinny needs someone that knows how to handle a thing like that—I wonder if his mother does.\" Martha was unable to sleep, thinking of Skinny in a room full of tough boys; talking, as the sergeant had promised he would, because that ridiculous nose of his would not give him any peace with the tears crowding back of it, hurting his eyes and his throat. And she YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE knew that, beside her, Bill wasn't sleeping, either. She wasn't surprised then, when Bill said the next morning after breakfast, \"Guess Ill drive down and see what happened to the kids. Want to go along?\" Martha nodded. She had remembered in the night about the little baby and the boy that had been denied them. It was no use, and she wished now that she could keep this last disappointment from Bill. In those last weary hours before dawn, she had resigned herself to forget Skinny and all other small boys and to accept the dreariness of her empty heart. MARTHA was amazed at the sure and determined manner with which Bill approached the captain. When he mentioned the boys that had been brought in the night before, the captain nodded, looking at the report sheet before him. Most of those boys are old offenders,\" he said. \"They will be committed to the State industrial school.\" \"Not that little one—Skinny?\" Martha breathed. \"Well,\" the Captain frowned. \"His mother was located and talked to. She isn't a fit person to have charge of him and she doesn't want to be bothered.\" \"But there is a parole for adult criminals,\" Bill protested, \"what about paroling the kid to us?\" The captain looked at him. \"You don't know what you're taking on, Mister,\" he said gruffly. \"When his mother finds out that you're interested, she won't hear of adoption. She'll let you take him and then hope to get something out 383 of you through the kid, and as soon as he begins earning money, his mother will pop up and demand him back again. And it just means that you folks, with the best intentions in the world, will have your hearts broken.\" Martha looked at him. \"Our hearts broken?\" she asked softly. \"Captain, it's the young whose hearts are fragile. Let us help! If we can only keep his heart from being destroyed—\" It was a long time after that before they were finally seated in the car, actually on their way home, with Skinny tucked between: them on the wide front seat. Martha glanced carefully down at the shock of dirty, black hair. 'The brown eyes had not lost their opaqueness, their secretiveness, and they stared ahead, unquestioning, unanswering. The captain had explained that this custody was temporary. 'The case would have to come before the Juvenile Court, and then a licensed social agency would place the boy in a foster home—perhaps in Martha's home. As Martha watched him, Skinny lifted his arm and wiped his sleeve across his nose, not sniffling, not admitting weakness, but driven to that gesture by the forces that were relentless within him. Bill's hand left the wheel and reached for his handkerchief. Handing it casually to Skinny, he said, \"Blow hard, Son!\" Only then did Martha remember Dan. | Never another Dan, she thought. This is our new son. This is Skinny. And suddenly all in the car were at peace. El] Paso and the Latter-Day Saints Sadie Ollorton Clark President, Houston, Texas, Branch Relief Society T was in April 1910, that Porfirio | Diaz finally became alarmed over the brewing Mexican revolution. He threw the frail idealist, Francesco Madero, into the San Luis Potosi prison and thereby ended a third of a century of absolute dictatorship. Little did he realize that a forced American migration would follow this act, nor did the unsuspecting Latter-day Saint colonists know how soon they would have to flee from their homes, or which families would be responsible for a new stronghold of the Church —the yet unborn El Paso Ward. The location of the city of El Paso has much to do with it's colorful history. 'The first name, \"Fl Paso del Norte,\" means the \"northern pass.\" The Rio Grande River, at this point, flows through the cactus-covered mountains, creating the best natural passage from the north to south in many desert miles. It was equally important as a station in stage-coach days, and was the key point in a transcontinental railroad building race in 1881. In the sixteenth century the venturesome Franciscan friars, traveling from Mexico City to Santa Fe with the Spanish explorers on the dusty Camino Real would give thanks for the grateful shade of the cottonwoods growing on the banks of the river, and would rest at this oasis in the desert. 'Today, cross-country tourists find this modern city a natural breaking point in a journey east or west. Page 384 American historians tell us the first white visitor to this colorful land was Cabeza de Vaca, the only survivor of the shipwrecked Navarez expedition of 1527. He found his way to this area in 1536 and was welcomed by the Indians living there. He was never able to explain why one tribe after another looked upon him as their God, asking him to heal their sick and bless their food and their children. For the next three hundred years this territory was under Spanish and Mexican rule. As a result of the battle of San Jacinto in April 1836, it became part of the Republic of Texas. In 1846 Texas was annexed by the United States. Of interest to Latter-day Saint readers is the fact that Alexander Doniphan was the first man to bring the American flag to El Paso. This was in 1846, during the wat with Mexico. Doniphan was loved by the Missouri saints because he befriended them in the unhappy days when they were expelled from Jackson County. When he was ordered to execute the Prophet Joseph Smith he refused, and told his superior, \"It is cold blooded murder. I will not obey your order. If you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God.\" The chief settlement in those exciting days was on the south side of the river. El Paso was known as \"Franklin,\" and was too small to be very well-known. The Mormon Courtesy, Chamber of Commerce, El Paso, Texas VIEW OF MAIN BUSINESS SECTION, EL PASO, TEXAS Page 385 386 Battalion crossed the desert a few miles north of the village, in 1846, on their journey to California. In 1876, Anthony W. Ivins, with a party going to Mexico, camped on the north bank of the river, and shot a deer on the spot which is now the center of the city. In 1897, the Church Authorities asked Isaac W. Pierce to go to Cuidad Juarez and open up a lumper yard for the benefit of the people living in the timber regions of Chihuahua. He was the first Latter-day Saint to live in this locality, and his residence was a home for all friends going to and coming from Mexico. The first Church services in that city were held in his own house. Isaac Pierce was truly a benefactor to hundreds of travelers who came to him for aid, and he kept up his good work as long as he lived. He died in 1906. His son, Arwell L. Pierce, carried on his father's business as well as his interest in the Church. In 1912 he moved from Cuidad Juarez. He was the first Latter-day Saint to make a permanent home in El Paso, and when he moved there the Church came with him. But: in 1912, the old order passed in Mexico. One of the first demands the revolutionists made was the evacuation of the Latter-day Saints who had sought refuge in their land. Because of the Edmunds law, which was passed in 1882, a small group of Church members felt that the only way 'they could keep their families together was to leave the United States and make Mexico their home. In the decade preceding the turn of the century, they migrated to this southRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 ern country. Though few of them gave up their American citizenship, they all had come to look upon Mexico as their homeland. Their buildings were permanent, their plans for the future were all to be fulfilled in Mexico. But suddenly, and without warning, orders were given to leave.. Villa and his bandits were moving in on the villages, and it was worth a man's life to stay and defend his property. The colonists had prospered in Mexico, and the homes they left behind were spacious and beautiful. 'They were denied time enough to salvage their portable possessions. Beautiful china, valuable silver, precious keepsakes and _heirlooms were all left to be confiscated or destroyed by the marauding outlaws. J. W. Wilson of El Paso tells that he was in bed with a broken back, in the village of Pearson, when word came that Villa was on top of the mountain near the little town. The Americans left, wasting no time. Mr. Wilson refused any offers of help. He crawled to the top story of the house and hid himself. 'Through an attic window he watched the bandit army as it marched through and ransacked the town, looting, robbing, and even killing several of the native — citizens, then riding on. When Mr. Wilson did leave Mexico, he came, as most of the refugees did, to Cuidad Juarez on the train. He says: The railroad was so badly torn up and so many revolutionists were on it, that I was just two weeks from the time I left my home until I crossed the bridge into FE] Paso at three in the morning. The Mexican soldiers searched me and took all the cash I had before they would let me come across. When I landed on the",

This was typical of the condition of more than 3500 people. 'They came to El Paso destitute and penniless. 'Their American citizenship was not questioned, but the town was not prepared for such a multitude. 'The officials of the city did all they could to help them, but the townspeople received them with mixed emotions—pity for their plight and hesitancy about taking in so many of a despised people. As there were no houses ready for them at the time, the refugees were unloaded at a lumber yard, and as long as they were in desperate need the United States government fed them. Without any delay, the separate families set up housekeeping between piles of boards and shingles, making the best of what they had until they could improve their situaLATTER-DAY SAINT CHAPEL, EL 387 tions. The unconquerable pioneer spirit of these people showed itself in these trying days. It would have taken a greater catastrophe than this to make them give up. While the women cooked and washed over the campfires, husbands and _ fathers surveyed the town for jobs and vacant houses. Within a week, over half of them had found work and had rented homes. Before a month had passed the entire company had left the lumber yard. [MMEDIATELY after their arrival, Senator A. B. Fall asked for a government appropriation for their immediate aid, and money to send them any place in the United States where they had relatives to help, or an assurance of work. Approximately seventy-five per cent of the refugees accepted this aid, and left El Paso. Most of them went to Utah, but many of the people decided to remain, and it is they who became PASO, TEXAS 388 the nucleus of the present El Paso Ward. They and their children have become respected citizens of the border city. Many of them are now prominent in business, political, and professional circles. 'They have built beautiful and substantial homes, and, all in all, take an important part in the community. One of the beauty spots of the El Paso valley is the country home of Bishop George Q. Payne. It is built of native stone, typical of its surroundings, but it is unusual because of the variety and beauty of the flowers and shrubs which grow in profusion in his gardens. The arid and rocky soil of this country can produce vegetation, but it takes labor and devotion to beautify even a small yard. The saints of the El] Paso Ward take great pride in their chapel. For years the erection of a suitable meetinghouse was the common aim and desire of every Latter-day Saint family in the vicinity, and practically every member has some personal interest in it. It cost approximately $75,000 and compares favorably with the most beautiful and expensive chapels in the Church today. The building is a modified Spanish type, in keeping with the best architecture of the city. The lawns are always green and well-kept, even during the winter. The custodian, Otto Baptist, a convert from Belgium, takes special pride in the upkeep of the Church property. He is, and has been, the only custodian since the chapel was built in 1931. A friendly and gracious spirit seems to radiate from the walls of this sacred edifice, and to the members it is indeed a second home. On RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 Sunday mornings they gather on the patio and visit in the warm sunshine. After the evening meeting the foyer is crowded with a friendly, handshaking group who refuse to leave until the last light is turned off. The membership of the ward is constantly increasing because visitors, first impressed by the fraternity and feeling of fellowship the members show for one another, are willing to listen to the truths of the gospel. The El Paso Ward has had only two bishops. Arwell L. Pierce was ordained the bishop in 1918 when the ward was first organized, and he remained in that position until 1942, when he was called to preside over the Mexican Mission. He, more than any other one individual, is responsible for the growth and the happy condition of the ward. He has been a prominent business man for many years in El Paso, but his greatest interest has always been in the welfare of the Church and the people who came to it. His home has been a haven for visitors going to or coming from Mexico, and most of the General Authorities of the Church have enjoyed his hospitality. Because of his unusual possession of a dual citizenship, and also because of the great respect he commands, he has been able to render service to thousands of travelers who have had difficulty in crossing the international border. Whether it was a misunderstanding of the language, laws, or personalities, a call to Bishop Pierce would generally solve the problem. Bishop George Q. Payne has carried on this excellent work. He guided the ward through the war EL PASO AND THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS years, when, because of the proximity of Fort Bliss to El Paso, hundreds of Latter-day Saint boys were able to come to Church. Special Priesthood classes were held for these service men. The MLA. Planned a full recreation program, and no Latter-day Saint boy needed to investigate the night clubs on the Mexican side of the river for entertainment. 'There were seventy-two boys who served under their country's flag, from the E] Paso Ward. The El Paso Ward was first a part of Juarez Stake, with headquarters in Mexico. In 1919 it was annexed to the St. Joseph Stake, and when St. Joseph was divided, El Paso became a member of the Mt. Graham 389 Stake. Its membership now totals around 700. A high percentage of the people are active in Church work, and a most gratifying number pay a full tithing. Officers travel 250 miles each way every month to attend union meetings at Safford, Arizona, and several high council members and stake officers are members of the El Paso Ward. The dauntless and lofty spirit which has always characterized this group seems to be diffused into all who have later come to make EI Paso their home. Although it was born of revolution and bloodshed, its ultimate destiny seems to be a working unit in the kingdom of God.: ———> Pastoral Gene Romolo Above the emerald herbage-covered hills, A shining dawn arises from the night And one full-throated song thrush blithely trills A paean for the largess of the light.

    "content": "Orchid Hunting in Honduras Elizabeth Williamson promised to tell you about our orchid-hunting expeditions (unscientific! ) here in the center of Honduras. As you remember, I never cared particularly for orchids. Of course, we were thrilled at school when someone sent us a corsage with an orchid in it, but I was impressed not so much by the beauty and rarity of the flower as to why anyone would spend five dollars for an orchid when ten cents worth of violets would have made me happy! Anyhow, I've changed my mind. Orchids are magnificent! And, furthermore, I've learned to like them. Some are so tiny it is difficult to see the structure of the bloom. They come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. They grow wild, and are uncultivated. 'The native women gather and bring them down from the mountains in basketfuls on their heads. 'They sell them for fifty centavos a bunch! (twenty-five cents in Our money). We first became interested in orchids while we were picnicking and, accidentally, found some on an old oak tree. 'They were a beautiful long spray of tawny gold blossoms, with dark brown spots on the petals. We didn't find any more that day. They are most elusive and especially well camouflaged. They grow in the most inaccessible places, high in an old (and very rotten) oak tree, or on the side of a cliff. From that day on, we were absorbed in orchid-hunting. Something like searching for pirate's treasure—I can understand how fasPage 390 cinated scientists and archaeologists are in finding and developing their special interests. We were only amateurs and knew very little, technically or botanically, but we were spurred on by the hunt, the reward —the fun in general. We _ never knew what species would be revealed. If we made a find we could bring it back—give it to a collector or hang it on a nail in our patio, water it occasionally, and it would thrive and bloom like mad. (Incidentally my favorite find was a pale green orchid about one inch in diameter. It grew in a cluster of three or four. I never saw one like it again and didn't identify it.) We usually went in groups on our hunts, people who liked to hike primarily (but the not-toostrenuous type). In one of our groups there was an archaeologist, a naturalist and his wife, a young Swiss outdoor man, an artist, and usually another couple for good measure. (All of the people in the group were interested in photography.) FE, took sandwiches, chocolate, fruit, things we could carry in our pockets, ice and a soft drink for after the hunt. We piled into a station wagon, as it seemed to hold more people and specimens. The day I remember particularly well because of the loot was the Provividencia Day. Providencia is an orphanage farm for small boys. It is a lovely place in the pines about seven miles from Josef Muench © re Q = w) \\e) a es] esl Zz, \" 392 town. In the main building we could get refreshments served by the Swiss in charge of the orphanage. The surrounding country is very much like our own mountain country in northern Arizona or New Mexico. Or, as a matter of fact, almost anywhere where there are pines and a scant undergrowth. 'The elevation is about thirty-five hundred feet. It seemed strange to hike through pines and oaks and suddenly come upon a banana plant or a palm tree. Otherwise we felt quite at home. At the beginning I felt rather dubious about the snake situation, but during the two years we were there I never saw a snake. Doubtless, there are many at lower altitudes. However, there were plenty of seed-ticks and red bugs—not harmful, but annoying beyond description. On Providencia Day we left the orphanage farm and took a trail through the pine woods. The naturalist was helpful in pointing RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 out new plants and birds. The Swiss explained the correct walking technique. (It was amazing how it worked and helped!) Frequently we took little side trails on our own, searching and discovering this and that. That day we heard a whistle from a distance and saw the naturalist walking rapidly towards us. When he reached us we asked him what had happened, what he had found. He was disturbingly calm and said, \"Come along, I want to show you something magnifico!\" We went down a path until we came to a hollow which looked like a deserted banana grove. We climbed through overgrown brush and tangled vines, down into the bananas. I imagined I could see little bright eyes peering at me, eyes of unknown creatures waiting to bite, sting, or wrap themselves around my body and squeeze me to death! Nothing happened. Then at the bottom of the grove we were told to turn around and look up. We saw a beautiful thing—a small ORCHID HUNTING IN HONDURAS cliff banked solidly with fragile white orchid blooms. Some had turned to yellow. We discovered later that although they remained fresh and firm, they turned yellow before they died. True to form it was almost impossible to reach them. However, we carried back a few specimens. They were identified later as \"Estrella del mar'—Star of the Sea. We thought it a most satisfying day and relaxed contentedly over our refreshments in the orphanage patio. 'The Swiss lady in charge was exuberant about our discovery. She 393 probably knew where many other orchids were hidden which she had passed by on her numerous rides through the country by burro back. But she also knew it was much more fun and soul-satisfying to make these discoveries ourselves. P. S. When we were ready to leave the orphanage each of the women in the group was presented with a huge bunch of violets from the Swiss lady's own garden! _-",

To throw one's self down with a newspaper or book is not to rest; it is only a change of occupation. To sit down and keep the fingers flying over some sort of fancy work, as if one were pursued by a demon of unrest, is certainly not rest. But to lie at full length on a hard surface; arms extended at the sides, head back, with no pillow, eyes closed, all cares, and worries dismissed—this is rest; this will smooth away wrinkles in the face and in temper; this will give an air of repose to the tired, anxious nervous woman; this will take away many an ache and straighten out the rounded shoulders and craned out necks.

Whenever you go on a vacation, look for unusual branches, stumps, rocks, and grasses. Here is a hobby for the whole family to engage in together. Make a collection. For instance, instead of speeding across our Utah desert at an unsafe rate, stop once in awhile, get out and walk around a bit. Look especially where vegetation is having a hard time surviving. Usually in windswept areas or on extremely sandy or rocky hillsides—anywhere nature is having a difficult time—you will find the grotesque and weird-shaped branches and trees that are so tremendously interesting. Watch for them! The writer, in company with his entire family, spent two very enjoyRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 able afternoons, tramping the desert southwest of Tooele, Utah. It would be hard to say who enjoyed the outing most, the grownups, or the children, whose keen imaginations were given free play. How delighted they were to discover some twisted branch or weird-shaped stump and proudly add it to our collection. Even the baby seemed to know that some unusual pastime was in progress. My mother, who is of an age when many women pre: fer to sit at home, had a sparkle in her eye, as she picked up such objects as pieces of gnarled native cedar to represent her contribution to our store. We returned home with a wonderful assortment to add to our pleasure and that of our friends for many days to come. The accompanying _ illustration TABLE SETTINGS AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS 401 shows a fine specimen, exactly as it was picked up on our jaunt. This branch illustrates perfectly the principle of informal balance. Can't you just picture it mounted on a plaster of Paris base and set in a large window with ivy or philodendron twining around it? OW as to the actual arranging of flowers. Remember it is always desirable to incorporate some accent into the design. It is like a dress. The dress that is remembered is the one with some sort of accent. It gives character to the dress and likewise, accent gives character to the flower arrangement. Usually the best accent flowers are those that grow in tall spikes, such as snapdragons, stocks, glads, heather, Liatris, and the like, many of which are to be found in our gardens. In the absence of a spike flower, one may be improvised by tying or witing flowers together as a garland to resemble a spike. Much has been written about \"line\" arrangements in flowers, and the term has been unnecessarily shrouded in mystery. Many people have told me: \"Oh I couldn't do a line arrangement.\" Yet they go ahead and make a design and, without knowing it, use an adaptation of this principle. 'There is really nothing difficult about it. A \"line\" design is merely any arrangement that falls into dominant or accent lines. 'The beginner, placing asters loosely in a bowl usually makes a fine effect. She uses the \"line of the circle.\" Of more character than the line of the circle are those of the vertical, the horizontal, and various combina- 402 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 TABLE SETTINGS AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS tions or adaptations of these two. The principal idea to keep in mind with any arrangement of dominant lines is to keep them flowing, graceful, and spontaneous, never set, rigid, or stiff. One particular form, which is not only interesting but is capable of innumerable variations, ls the line of the asymmetrical triangle. 'The accompanying diagrammatic illustrations show various adaptations of this informal arrangement. 'The diagrams show what would be twigs, branches, or flowers. In actual practice, however, the materials used are seldom found as illustrated but must be cut, bent, and arranged to conform to the desired effect. 'The drawings not only illustrate the principle of dominant lines but serve to show how balance achieved. (Note the effectiveness of may be 403 placing the pin frog \"off center\" when using a low, shallow bowl.) Much could be said, if space would permit, about the containers in which we place flowers. Do not be afraid to sharply accent. Make dominant lines really bold, leaving no doubt as to their dominance. One good rule to follow is to make your accent a minimum of one and half times the height or length of the container. A florist often uses lines as much as two or three times the dimensions of the container. If any part of the above discussion confuses you, please don't despaitr! Keep trying. Don't lose interest. Learn to experiment. Above all, don't make flower arranging a chore. It should always be on the light-hearted side. Please have fun with your flowers.

Pressed Flower Pictures—a ''Desj ning'' sning Hobby Mina Hartvigsen Wright, Murray, Utah, Creates Lasting Beauty by Arranging Flowers in Frames \"MAKING pressed flower pictures is only one of my hobbies,\" Mrs. Wright ex. Plains, \"but it challenges the skill of my fingers and the reaches of my mind.\" The possible patterns and combinations of form and color are infinite, but all of Mrs. Wright's \"floral portraits\"' reveal gtacefulness, expert blending of tones and tints, as well as striking and unique contrasts. In addition to the methods used by many hobbyists, Mrs. Wright experiments with tinting petals and coloring the delicate network of veins in the blossoms. She is an expert at the exacting art of sand pressing. Her designs have won many prizes and awards, including a certificate of honor presented by the Utah Centennial Committee in 1947. Between the newspapers. For weights she uses an old anvil, a pan of nails, or any other heavy material which will exert sufficient pressure. Page 404 PRESSED FLOWER PICTURES 405 When the flowers have been gathered and pressed ready for assembling and designing into \"portraits\" Mrs. Wright prepares the picture frames and mounting materials. For the foundation of the portrait she uses heavy, smooth cardboard, padded with cheesecloth and covered with silk, satin, or taffeta in cream white or some pastel tint. The flowers are attached to the mounting with liquid paste. A masonite back is used to protect the picture from breakage and to seal it against dust and smoke. Mrs. Wright, in spite of being crippled since childhood, lives a full and useful life. At the age of five she suffered a fall which broke her back and from which she has never fully recovered. Very early in her childhood she Icarned to make yarn flowers and mount them on velvet and under glass. She made tissue-paper flowers; she tinted modeling clay and used it for many arts, making flowers, figurines, and picture frames. She also learned dressmaking, quilt and rugmaking, and various types of handwork. A musician and organist of ability, Mrs. Wright is also a poet, having written over two hundred original compositions. In Church work her particular interest is genealogy, and at home her large family, six sons and a daughter, make life interesting and eventful. \"What a privilege is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" Mrs. Wright often remarks, for she has found the world wide and wonderful, and she endeavors to share her talents and her accomplishments with others.",

Experience has clarified it. I recall a neighbor of mine who did not seem to be able to do anything alone. If she was to make pies, she came for me or got another of her neighbors to peel apples with her. She wanted to help me do my washing and then have me help her so that we could be together. She did not seem to be able to spend an evening or even an hour by herself. When her husband and son were away, as they frequently were, she was always hatching up some excuse for a small party. \"How that woman must hate herself,\" my husband said once, impatiently. \"No, it isn't exactly that,\" I said, \"she hasn't the inner reserves or resources that make herself worthy of entertaining herself. She hasn't developed fascinating hobbies, reading, fancywork, playing a musical instrument, writing poems, which might give her something to say to and to do with herself when she is alone. And so she makes an evil out of the fine quality of neighborliness by doing it to death.\" And what a pity it is, for sooner or later, one will have occasion to be thrown upon one's own resources—in prolonged illness, in living in isolated areas—maybe in sheer defense when one's neighbors have grown weary of too much neighboring. It would be well for all of us to take stock of our own resources, our ability to entertain ourselves. If we could say with the poet, \"I'm the best friend that I ever had; I like to be with me,\" how rich we would be; emotionally, how mature.",

    "content": "A Family's a Family Estelle Webb Thomas RS. Damon laid down the M letter and glanced around the breakfast table at the assortment of faces turned toward her, expectantly. \"My goodness!\" she murmured, helplessly. 'There was an instant of silence. Mr. Damon cleared his throat. \"When did you say they are coming?\" he inquired. \"Tonight!\" Mrs. Damon glanced at the letter for confirmation, hoping she had misread it, but knowing she hadn't. \"Yes, tonight, the tenth. You see, the letter was delayed.\" \"Read it again!\" Aunt Janey demanded, \"I don't rightly know what you're talking about!\" She cupped her hand behind her ear and leaned nearer, busily chewing, as she listened. Mrs. Damon picked up the letter again and obligingly shouted, \"I'll just read what he says about coming: So, I'm bringing her home to meet the family. She has about everything else in the world, but she doesn't have any relatives. There's where I have the advantage of her. Maybe a real, live family —and I do mean live, will help me to sell myself to her. \"And he says she's an orphan— raised in boarding schools!\" Curtis, the fifteen-year-old, said, wonderingly. \"What's he trying to do, shock the poor girl to death!\" \"Oh, Curt!\" Mrs. Damon's tone reproached him, but she added, doubtfully, \"but I do wonder what she'll think of us?\" \"She'll think I'm a fine figure of Page 406 a man!\" Mr. Damon complacently patted his billowing waistline. \"Prob'ly can't see the man for the figger!'\" Aunt Janey snapped, in one of her unexpectedly sharp moments. Mr. Damon laughed, goodnaturedly. \"Well, Aunt Janey, it cost too much to put it there, for me to want to lose any of it!\" he yelled. \"See how proud Dale is of you all!\" Mrs. Damon said, quickly, forestalling another comment by Aunt Janey, \"I hope you'll do him credit!\" \"His memory must be failing,\" Curt observed, cynically. \"I remember when he wanted to keep us a secret from his girls.\" \"Oh, Curt, it wasn't that!\" his mother protested. \"It was just that he wanted you smaller ones to sort of grow on people, gradually.\" \"Couldn't we have the twins and Mike in bed when they get here?\" Natalie suggested. Natalie was seventeen and, since she was in love most of the time, thought she could understand Dale's situation better than anyone else. \"Let them grow on her gradually, as you say.\" \"But she'd be bound to find out about them next morning!\" Mrs. Damon sighed. \"And they're so bouncy mormings!\" Natalie said, hopelessly. \"We could give them sleeping pills—\" Curt began, when the twins and Michael, who had been engaged in a quiet game of toast stealing while the grown-ups' attention was absorbed, suddenly woke up to A FAMILY'S A FAMILY the fact the conversation concerned them. \"Jeepers!\" Patty shouted, \"what are we, smallpox or something? What've we done now?\" \"Yes, what've we done, now?\" Penny echoed. Mike, hastily swallowing Penny's toast, wiped his mouth and _ assumed the angelic expression which was his assurance against accusation —just or unjust. \"I've done nothing,\" he said, Dlandly. \"Murder will out!\" Aunt Janey pronounced, grimly, scraping her cereal bowl. \"And Dale actually wants to exhibit these—\" Curt began again, but Mr. Damon interrupted, sternly, \"That will do, Curtis! If Dale is proud enough of the family to bring his girl all the way from Chicago to meet us, why should you feel so differently?\" \"T don't know, Dad,\" Curtis considered the question gravely, \"there are some old adages that might explain it. 'Distance lends enchantment,' is one, and 'Absence makes the heart grow fonder, | imagine it's the latter that applies to Dale's case. Nothing could lend enchantment to our kids.\" \"Well, as I allus say,' remarked Aunt Janey, apropos of nothing, \"There's just as good fish in the sea as was ever caught.\" \"PT HANK goodness, it's Saturday,\" Mrs. Damon said, rising briskly. \"You can all help get ready for them. We do want to do Dale proud, bless his heart. I mustn't forget to start those rolls he asks for in his postscript. Let's see—Natalie, I'll tum the living room over 407 to you.\" She turned distractedly to the twins. \"You girls do your room, and do it well! But first, wash the dishes. And do keep your eyes on Michael! Michael!\" Mike, who had been sneaking out, turned slowly back. \"Gather up all your toys, from the hall and everywhere and take them up to the attic.\" Mike's angelic smile faded, \"But what'll I play with?\" he whined. \"Get outside and play like a boy!\" Curt said, impatiently. \"You're too big to play with toys all the time.\" Mike threw back his shoulders and looked every one of his six years. \"\"That's right!\" he said, finding the suggestion good. \"And you, Curtis,\" Mrs. Damon went inexorably on, \"please shake all the rugs and hang them on the line, till we get the floors waxed.\" Curtis, who thought she had forgotten him and was trying to slip away to his workshop in the attic, reluctantly shuffled into the living room. \"I didn't have time to shave this morning,\" Mr. Damon said, hastily snatching his hat and coat. \"Will it be too much to hope that I can have the bathroom for a brief period this evening?\" Without waiting for an answer, he dashed into the hall and, a moment Iater, a heavy thud brought the family on a run to see him scrambling up off the floor. \"Where's that Mike?\" he shouted, wrathfully, \"he—I'll—that's the last time I'l ever slip on that thing!\" He kicked a bright, red dump truck viciously across the hall. \"Are you hurt, John?\" Mrs, Damon asked, anxiously, as she stooped 408 automatically to pick up the offending truck. \"No thanks to that kid if ''m not,\" her husband muttered, \"and put that toy right back where it was! He'll never learn to put his toys away, so long as you do it for him!\" Mrs. Damon meekly replaced the truck and looked vaguely around for Michael. He seemed to have disappeared, but she could hear the twins upstairs, loudly cleaning their room. Probably he was with them or Curt. Aunt Janey was calling and she hurried away. When Curtis had finally retreated to his attic laboratory, Mrs. Damon again missed Michael. She took her hands out of the dough and went to the foot of the stairs. \"Curtis! Is Michael with you?\" An indistinguishable murmur answered her. \"Well, send him down to pick up his toys,\" she called, and went back to finish mixing her rolls and plan the rest of her dinner. At 11:30, she called Natalie, \"I must run downtown, dear. Aunt Janey wants some yarn matched, and you know how she is—doesn't think you could possibly do it right! Besides, I think P'll ask Esther for her recipe for shrimp salad, it's better than mine. Fix the children some soup and crackers, will you, and take Aunt Janey a tray? And please get Michael out of the attic and see that he picks up his toys!' She hurried away, skirting the dump truck, still in the hall. T' was inevitable that there should be callers that afternoon. Mrs. Damon laughed and chatted, inwardly seething. Nothing was being made ready for the visitors. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 Natalie, who had started to make her room immaculate, for Elyse must share it with her, was crosslegged on the floor, deep in old letters, as she always ended up when she tackled her vanity drawers. Curt was presumably in his laboratory, as always when he had his way, and from their shrieks and laughter, it was evident the twins were sprinkling the lawn and particularly each other. The dough for the rolls was booming over the pan's edge, when the guests finally took their leave. \"Look out for the dump truck!\" Mrs. Daman Called, just in time to save fat Mrs. Boris a bad fall. \"I have to leave it for Michael to pick up— his father's orders.\" \"Where is Michael?\" she cried, a few minutes later, \"I can't remember when I saw him last!\" Feeling suddenly terribly uneasy, she ran into Natalie's room. \"Nat, where's Michael? Where did he go after lunch?\" f \"He wasn't here for lunch, Mothet.\" Natalie looked up, absently. \"Didn't he go with you?\" \"Curtis!\" shrieked Mrs. Damon, running to the foot of the stairs, \"fs Mike with you?\" \"I haven't seen Mike since breakfast,\" Curtis answered, crossly. \"I was right in the middle—\" \"Oh, my baby! Oh, gracious, where is he?\" Mrs. Damon's anguished cry brought the other children running. In a few minutes, sobered and anxious, they had scattered in search of him, and Mrs. Damon was frantically telephoning her husband. At six o'clock, Curtis came in with the vagrant, followed, during A FAMILY'S A FAMILY the next half hour, by the other detachments of the searchers, returning, wearily, to report failure. Aunt Janey, who had Temained unmoved throughout the entire affair, ow commented oracularly, \"Don't I always say, a bad penny will return?\" Michael, it transpired, had taken Curt's suggestion that he play like a boy, literally. He had wandered into the streets, joined a gang going fishing, or rather been allowed fo tag along, been dared to go swimming, and almost drowned in the icy water, before one of the boys had discovered he knew very little about swimming. The frightened boys had tried to send him home then, and Michael had been quite ready to go. He was hungry and cold and dirty. The only thing that had prevented his going straight home was that he did not know where his home was. Suddenly, he was an adventurer no longer, but a little boy, barely six, with lots of nice toys at home and a mother it seemed he had not seen for years. He had begun to cry, standing by the dusty road, rublittle face. Picked him up and was trying, at a gas station on the outskirts of town, to find where the Damons lived, when Curt caught sight of Mike's dirt-streaked face behind an enormous hamburger, and had claimed him. Curt and Mike arrived home shortly before the twins, who were almost as disreputable looking as Mike—limp and dejected, hair ribbons lost and hair flying loose. Vic- 409 tims of conscience because they had not \"looked out\" for Michael, they dragged in, so sure he was kidnapped and lost forever that, at sight of his filthy, smug little face, they began to howl, with mingled relief and anger, that he had made them suffer so. There were more tears from Mts. Damon and Natalie a few minutes later and a few forceful remarks from Mr. Damon before he hurried into the bathroom, declaring he was going to get his shaving over before cleaning operations began on those kids. RS. Damon was in the kitchen starting the delayed dinner, when his voice rang through the house, iritably demanding quiet. \"I can't even hear myself shave in this racket!\" he yelled. \"Hear yourself shave?\" Mrs. Damon shouted back. She was in the midst of shaping her rolls and couldn't run as she usually did at his call. \"Certainly!\" he stuck his lathered face through the bathroom doorway. \"Didn't you know I had to learn to shave by ear? Curt is always taking the light bulb for his pesky workroom and leaving the socket empty!\" Still grumbling, he disappeared into the bathroom. \"Oh, dear!\" Mrs. Damon despaired of making Curt hear through the hubbub. Let John shave by ear and get out of the bathroom so Natalie could start on the children before Dale and Elyse arrived. It was at this inauspicious moment that the front door was thrown open and a joyous shout of, \"Hi, folks!' Here's—\" followed by two heavy thuds, brought everyone, in- 410 cluding Mr. Damon, with one side of his face lathered, to the front hall. On the floor, flat on his back, lay Dale and sprawled across him, a girl who was pretty even in that ridiculous position. In the excitement of finding Michael, someone had kicked the dump truck back into the middle of the hall. Mr. Damon, looking like a onesided Santa Claus, and Curtis helped the embarrassed couple to their feet, and Dale, laughing and rather red-faced, began introductions. He hesitated when he came to the three younger ones, as if he could scarcely recognize the little tramps; but went manfully on, \"And this pair, Patty and Penny, better known as the Gruesome Twosome or Double Trouble, and Mike—\" \"An angel with a dirty face!\" Michael put in dimpling. He felt quite a hero as the cause of so much commotion and, remembering that Natalie had so designated him in a moment of weakness, thought it would help to establish his status with Elyse. \"It never rains but it pours, I allus say,\" Aunt Janey pronounced, ambiguously, when she was introduced. With such a start for the visit, Mrs. Damon feared the worst. But the children, evidently feeling they had done their worst, were almost models of propriety. Michael did ask Elyse, earnestly, if she thought Daddy was a fine figger of a man and Patty repeated Aunt Janey's trenchant comment. Penny then volunteered the information that Mother would probably be a fine figure of a woman if she didn't RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 do bendings all the time, and at the mental picture of Mother's \"bendings,\" she and Patty had such an attack of giggles they had to be sent away from the table. There was another awkward moment when Aunt Janey, chewing vigorously with her front teeth, stared balefully over her glasses at Elyse and stated, cryptically, \"Well, pretty is as pretty does, I allus say. These lapses were quickly covered by the adult and aware members of the family, but Mr. Damon's tone was hollowly hearty and Mrs. Damon was frankly flustered. Even Natalie and Curt, with all the aplomb of modern youth, felt they were fighting a lost cause. Dale watched Elyse anxiously, trying to see behind her polite, smiling mask, giving the others piteous glances that begged, come on now, please show her how nice you can really be! But when the children were sent to bed, loudly protesting that it was still early, the sense of sitting on top of an active volcano somewhat abated, although there was. Still Aunt Janey to be reckoned with. Mrs. Damon tactfully suggested that the travelers must be weary and, as soon as was decently possible, everyone retired. ALE breathed a huge sigh of relef when the last good night was said. He lingered a moment alone in the livingroom, trying to get back the joy that reunion with the family usually brought. But he could not help seeing the children through Elyse's eyes. Elyse, who had never known any home, but fashionable boarding schools, would un- A FAMILY'S A FAMILY doubtedly classify them as brats and Aunt Janey as a \"character.\" At that, the children had been tired and, for them, subdued during the evening. He shuddered at the thought of morning, when, refreshed and full of good will, they would take over the entertainment of the guest. Thank goodness, there would be a few hours respite before they must be coped with again. But he had congratulated himself too soon. In the hall, the pajama-clad twins were just completing a transaction whereby they had sold Elyse, whom they had waylaid en route to bed, a dollar's worth of garden seeds to help their \"school projeck.\" They were highly indignant when he caught them on the stairs and tried to gently reprove them. Patty said if he thought that was bad what about Elyse washing her face in the pitch dark because Curt had forgotten to put back the bulb. And then, when he was just sinking into uneasy slumber, a terrified shriek had brought him upright again and he had realized, with a sinking heart, that it came from Nat's room. It seemed that when the two girls had turned out the light and climbed into bed, Elyse, with an involuntary scream, had jumped right out again. Down. Under the covers, where he had crawled from the pillow, was Mike's pet horned toad, Galahad, every bit as frightened and upset as Elyse. Then, between a wild desire to laugh and humiliation, Dale and Natalie assured Elyse this was not a piece of cruel mischief, but simply a love offering and proof of how deeply Mike had fallen for her, since no- 411 one else was ever allowed to touch Galahad. Quiet, like a much disturbed bird, once more settled cautiously over the house. The girls finished their desultory conversation and were drifting off to sleep when a resounding bumpety-bump jarred the ceiling directly over their heads. That Curt, Nat thought, angrily, was big enough to know better. Evi. Dently he had not gone to bed but was still working in his stupid laboratory, and had carelessly dropped something. She slipped out of bed and quietly tiptoed from the room. Why the quiet, she did not know except to keep up the fiction that Elyse was asleep. She was ashamed of making excuses. She jetked the attic door open and hissed, \"I heard you trying to knock the house down and thought it was in very poor taste!\" Curt looked up innocently from his notebook, \"Oh, you mean when I accidently pushed all those books off the table?\" \"Was that what it was? I thought you'd dropped a ton of brick. Elyse nearly jumped out of bed!\" \"Elyse better take something for her nerves, if she's going to be one of us,\" Curt murmured, breathlessly. \"Don't you kids ever settle down, day or night?\" Dale stood at the foot of the stairs, his face strained and disillusioned. \"I thought we used to have fairly peaceful nights, anyway.\" He turned back into his room, and the two stared at each other with stricken faces. Natalie's eyes filled with tears and even Cur. Tis' monumental calm was shaken. \"IT guess we've kind of let him down,\" he muttered, as they crept down the stairs. 412 ARLY next morning, Dale knocked purposefully on Natalie's door. \"Nat, tell Elyse we'll have to be going, if she's to catch the seventhirty train!\" he called. \"But, Dale—\" he had gone into the kitchen, however, where his mother was starting _ breakfast. 'Mother, could Elyse and I have a bite before the others get up, so I can get her to the seven-thirty?\" Mrs. Damon turned a bewildered face, \"But Dale, I thought—\" \"No, shell be going back this morning,\" Dale interrupted, bleakly. \"Ill stay on for a week,\" he added, turning away. His manner forbade questioning and, puzzled and depressed, his mother began setting the table. She had had the impression they were both staying a week and going back together. Well, maybe she had misunderstood. Elyse made a mere pretense of eating, as did Dale, and bade Mrs. Damon a subdued goodbye. Her face was as pale and strained as Dale's and they drove to the depot in absolute silence. Silently, too, Dale carried her suitcases to the station platform and _ then stiffly held out his hand. \"Well, goodbye, Elyse. I hope you'll forgive me. I certainly was a fool, but it's better you found out now than when it was too late.\" \"But, Dale—\" Elyse began, but he held up his hand. \"Never mind making excuses, Elyse. I know just how the family appeared to you. I think I actually saw them through your eyes. I can see how those kids would seem to a gitl raised like you've been. Id RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 sort of forgotten how impossible they are.\" \"Listen, Dale—\"' \"Wait! I want to apologize for bringing you here, and for thinking, even for a minute, you could ever be happy with that—that three-ring circus—\" \"Dale—\" \"Or with me either. I'm not trying to pretend I'm not one of them. To be perfectly honest, I get a big kick out of those kids. If they'd change, I'd be disappointed as—I'd be disappointed. It's just that— well, we're not your kind of people!\" Elyse said, coldly, \"If you're quite through, Dale, may I say something before the train leaves?\" \"Sure! Come night out with what you think of them. I won't be offended!\" \"All right, I will! Except it's what I think of you, Dale Damon! I think you're the smuggest, most selfish boy I ever knew! Rushing me off after one night, when you'd invited me for a week! Giving me the brush-off without any explanation! What did I do?\" \"You?\" Dale stammered, \"Why, nothing, but Elyse—\" \"Shut up!\" Elyse snapped, furiously. \"You can't do all the talking, you know, even if you are the only one with a family—a background—\"' She choked and Dale said, in a bewildered tone, \"But those kids, Aunt Janey—I could just hear you telling your friends about them—\" \"T wonder if you could, really?\" Elyse asked, in a curious voice. \"Since you have so good an imagination, try imagining what it is never to have a soul of your own to talk about.

    "content": "Rescue That Little Rocker Rachel K. Laurgaard N how many junk-filled attics does Grandmother's little, old sewing rocker stand forlornly gathering dust and cobwebs, its cane seat poked through, awaiting the coming of the itinerant chair-mender, who will never pass this way again! Sometimes it rocks dejectedly on the back porch through sunshine and through rain until, falling apart, it is tossed on the woodpile or carried off by the junkman. Such a pity it is for this quaint piece to come to so neglected an end, when it might still grace a fireside or add charm to a period bedroom! No piece of solid wood furniture is ever in too hopeless a state to be refinished or repaired. 'True, the upholstery may be worn and soiled —tear it off and throw it away. The pretty natural markings of its wood may be concealed by layers of dark varnish and paint—scrape them off. A few hours of effort and a little application of elbow grease will reward you with a chair of which you can well be proud. To transform the rocker, you will need a can of paint and varnish remover, a putty knife or scraper, a file for the rungs and corners where the paint clings so tenaciously, sandpaper, boiled linseed oil, and turpentine., First, spread plenty of newspapers down and go after the old finish. 414 If your chair has been painted and repainted several times, it may take a couple of coats of paint remover to get it clean. The more work you let the paint remover do, the less work there will be for the sandpaper—and you. Scrape off the gummy paint with the putty knife, being careful not to gouge the wood. Dry it off thoroughly, and file and sandpaper it smooth. Some woods are softer and easier to work with than others, If you are lucky enough to have a walnut chair, you can get a smooth satiny finish in a comparatively short time. Maple and oak are harder. Always sandpaper with the grain. Coarse sandpaper will gouge walnut, but you may have to resort to it on badly scarred maple or oak. But be careful! Coarse sandpaper cuts deeply. A medium grade is the safest, and, for the final smoothing, use only the very finest. F your little rocker has become unglued or broken, you will probably find it more convenient to send it Out fo a fix-it shop for repairs. Furniture clamps are a necessity for a good job of re-gluing. Sometimes, however, it is an easy matter to glue a loose joint or two and. By means RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 of a well-placed screw, hold them securely. Small metal angles or flat sttips with holes for screws can be used to advantage to strengthen the seat from beneath. Now for the finishing process! If the wood is walnut, use walnut oil stain sparingly, and after that has dried, walnut wood filler, to fill the pores. When this has set for the required length of time, rub in a mix. Ture of boiled linseed oil and turpentine—two-thirds linseed oil to onethird turpentine. The finest of hand-rubbed furniture has a finish Impervious to water, achieved by the application of several coats of oil, with light sandpaper between cach coat. In fact, if you have real patience, eliminate the stain entirely and darken the wood slowly by rubbing in repeated coats of oil. However, if you wish to finish your little rocker quickly, two coats of oil are enough, with a good coat of liquid floor wax to top it off. Oak, maple, birch, and any others of the lighter woods are very nice finished in their natural color without benefit of stain. With oak, an oak filler may be used to seal the pores, or you may merely oil and wax it. Maple and birch are so RESCUE THAT LITTLE ROCKER close-grained that they don't need a filler. OUR little rocker is now ready for its covering. If it was in a good state of repair and had never had other covering than the caning, you may like to have it re-caned. This, of course, is the authentic thing to do and, perhaps in your community, there is an elderly cabinet-maker who, in his youth, learned the almost extinct art of caning. But cane seats are perishable, unfortunately, and long before your little rocker was relegated to the attic, it probably had a succession of makeshift seats tacked onto it. If such is the case, and there are many nail holes close to the caning holes, it will be better to fill them with plastic wood and do an upholstering job. This will not be difficult. Five yards of upholsterer's webbing, and plenty of tacks will do the trick. Fold the ends of two or three strips of the webbing, depending on the size of the seat, along the front, as close to the inside edge as possible, without danger of splitting or weakening the wood. Pull each strip so tight it twangs. 'Turn under and tack similarly to the back edge. Then attach three more strips to one side, 415 weave them through the first three strips, and attach firmly to the other side. 'The tighter the webbing is stretched, the less sag will develop in the seat. Do the back in a like mannet. Now stretch a piece of burlap or canvas over the webbing and tack down. If you can, use horsehair or upholster's moss for padding, especially for the seat. Old horsehair should be washed and dried in the sun to restore its springiness. But any sort of cotton batting will do very well and, in case you do use hair or moss, be sure to cover it with a layer of cotton so that it won't poke through the cover. Remember that the stuffing will pack down considerably, so use plenty of it, and cover this with muslin. Needlepoint or tapestry may be tacked on with small upholsterer's tacks, with matching braid glued around the edge, and caught with a curved needle and thread. Brassheaded tacks make a neat finish, too. Ruffled calico or chintz is best sewed onto the muslin cover, to make it easily removable for washing. There now, aren't you proud of your handiwork! And can't you just see Grandmother's eyes light up as she sees you rocking in her little chair? ___OoOO Oo —- --———",

One hundred and two years have passed since that first small band of men and three women entered the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. One hundred and two years of almost unbelievable progress! Thousands stand sweltering in the heat, waiting for the commemorating parade, heads bared to the flag and acutely conscious of the freedoms for which it stands. Pretense and folly are lost, for the moment, in reverence. Eyes are alight with pride and the spark of renewed ideals. The throat tightens as the parade, a colorful and symbolic pageant, moves down the street, historically depicting the scenes and achievements of the past. And we of the present generation can but stand and watch—and measure the adequacy of the present. Handcarts... I cannot follow them down the street. I cannot see them for my tears. \"Come, Come, Ye Saints\" That song is the embodiment of faith and the prayers that brought our people here. The cords of restraint all but snap, for to me it is my own parents singing It is their story I relive today we OK OK ok INTER came early in the year 1857. Almost before the fall days were done there was a heavy frost and the world seemed enveloped in a damp, thick blanket of fog. Every day it grew colder. Trees cracked in their bark and the sound was like ice popping on the Virgin River. The dampness penetrated every cranny of house and _ body. Cattle died on the range and corral stock could stand only by leaning against inadequate shelters and fences. 'The people, reduced to smutty flour for their coarse bread, with little milk or fruit, became inert like the half-frozen animals. But with the first intimation of spring the natural resilience of the pioneers called forth new courage, as surely as the warming of the sun called forth new grass. And, because horses were too poor for travel, a pioneer boy began a thirty-five-mile walk to the town where his sweetheart lived. The dawn was still raw with cold, but the air was freighted with the scent of coming buds and thawing ground. It was a good world. It made a man feel strong and free. Twelve hours later, in the welcoming, mild dusk, he swung in long strides up the street and to the house of the girl he loved. Together, they welcomed spring. Because of their distance from the Endowment House, they were married the next day by the girl's reluctant father and, in a borrowed wagon, drawn by a borrowed team, they began the journey to the town that was to be their new home. The boy had exactly a dollar and eightyfive cents. The girl had two dollars and a half, a chest packed to its bulging lid with homespuns, rugs, a Page 435 436 meager assortment of cooking utensils and dishes, and a few small packets of sugar, sage, and thyme. And, stowed carefully into the back of the wagon, was a small four-lid cookstove, her dead mother's most prized possession, now the binding link between the old life and the new for the young bride. The joint heritage of both the boy and the girl was an unshaken faith in the goodness of life and their part in it. Two days of creaking, jolting travel and the borrowed team pulled the borrowed wagon into the yard of the borrowed dugout that was to be their first home. The sun had gone down in a blaze of orange light. Strange sounds filled the twilight, sounds that saddened the girl by their unfamiliarity since they were part of the unknown that lay ahead. The boy turned the homemade key in the handmade lock, and they went into the windowless little dugout. And suddenly, because they were together, it became home. THERE followed days, weeks, and months of hardship and privation—drought, snakes, insects, hunger, fear. Sometimes, even doubt. A son was born, too frail and weak to survive in his rigid surroundings. There was little but faith left, yet it was enough to heal their sorrow and send them in search of a new and better location. The boy, in the new settlement, was assigned his section of land, did his allotted rods of fencing in the company plot, worked and prayed, fought Indians, guarded the fort; dreamed and waited for the good future he knew would be theirs. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 The girl, pressing back fatigue, hunger, fear, and sorrow, kept her faith, too. And she kept her smile and her love for her husband. \"T see a little light,\" she would tell him, \"we'll be prosperous some day, I have no doubt; but never more blessed than we are now. We'll have other children—sons and daughters who will be faithful and happy. All that we do now is for them.\" And the boy agreed. For, by then, they had a home, a garden, milk, and honey. And none of it was borrowed. Surely, God had been good to them. Then came another spring and another little new son. A strong boy, equal to his surroundings, beautiful as their faith. Then, as if to test them, they were called to help colonize in a high, cold climate that was foreign to them and seemingly barren of promise. But neither faltered. The boy left the girl to care for the little new son while he went ahead to prepare a home in the new place. The summer was hot and long. 'The girl and her baby were stricken with measles. Denied water to cool the fever and with little care by the frightened neighbors, who knew there was little they could do to stop the ravages of any disease, the baby died and the gitl was left alone. But she kept her faith and prayed to live, prayed for strength to bear her loneliness, prayed that the runner would find her husband soon and bring him home. And because of her faith, when the boy came, he found her smiling we Ke Ke \"Utah, We love thee. Land of FOR THOSE WHO COME AFTER the mountains high, land of the sunny sky\" Yes, Utah, we love thee! The pioneer floats were gone, now, lost in the parade. High school bands came gaily into view —smartly costumed boys and girls, playing with all the glad young strength of their hearts, their steps high with hope.... Floats depicting the state's prosperity.... Mining, manufacturing, building Agriculture, giant peaches, golden as the sunset shimmering on Great Salt Lake; celery as crisp and fresh as a mountain breeze; rainbows of flowers; floats of children, singing The new generations. And because of them, blessed be the old, the pioneer generation. A good heritage for us who pioneer in a new, and equally testing age. What is our stature? * Kk Ke & CROSS the valley, miles from the scene of the parade, is a little house, set well back in a halfacre lot, surrounded by a hopeful lawn and struggling young shrubs; wild columbine against the foundation; a steppingstone path and a waggly tailed little dog to welcome us. 'T'oday's young parents live here, and the place is their own. \"I want to see what I can do on my own,\" the boy said. \"Do you think you can take it?\" \"If I can't, what has my education been worth?\" she countered. She is young and fair-skinned, enthusiastic as a spring day—and as hospitable. He is not home, but as she takes us through the compact little house, we see him through her eyes—young, ambitious, eager to put his heritage to the test. And such 437 dreams they have, and faith, and ideals; these modern edition pioneers, as Courageous as were my 1857 boy and girl! By the work of their hands and their minds, they have managed to preserve the culture and dignity, the courage and foresight of their ancestors. Four years of navy service and college for him, four years of making things do and getting things done, for her. Three rooms built of pumice blocks, plastered by hand just to see if he could, painted by her just to see if she could. Her eyes shine as she shows us where the lintels are placed, for doors to new rooms are already planned and, when the little house begins to get growing pains, out will come a few blocks and there the door will be. With $2,000 saved from his service days, the house was built. From the attic and basement of their parents' homes, came the furnishings. Carefully refinished or slip-covered, these pieces look modern and inviting. And there is a real little cradle, of pioneer vintage from her own and her mother's baby days. Doors, windows, marble mantle and hearth, pressed stone for the kitchen work table tops, are anniversary, birthday, and Christmas gifts from their two families and their many friends. \"If I begin to wish there were more such anniversaries,\" she confided, laughing a little, \"I remind myself of all the things the real pioneers didn't have and never even dreamed of having: radiant heat, electric lights, automatic stoves and washing machines, refrigeration, doctors to apply the sciences that have brought children's diseases down to",

Her new assignment is a fitting climax to her activity in the auxilary organizations of the Church. She has served efficiently as secretary, class leader, and counselor in the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, as a Sunday School teacher, a Religion Class stake board member, and a counselor in Primary, but her greatest achievement and joy have come in Relief Society service. As a theology class leader, her lessons were well prepared and interestingly presented. The families in her district always welcomed her as a visiting teacher. In February 1939, she was called to be president of Plain City Ward Relief Society, being released in September of that year to become president of North Weber Stake Relief Society. January 18, 1942, at the division of the stake, she was chosen to preside in the new Farr West Stake and has continued in that calling until the present time. In this position, she has been a member of the executive council for the Latter-day Saint girls' program, which included for some time the NELLIE WARD NEAL preparation of the mothers and daughters meetings held in connection with stake quarterly conferences. She was Relief Society representative on the first Ogden Deseret Industries Committee, and vice chairman and later chairman of the Relief Society presidents department of the Northern Utah Region in welfare work. She performed faithfully and competently all the duties devolving upon her. A patriarchal blessing, given by her grandfather, James Ward, which promised that the spirit that led her Page 439 440 forefathers from the land of their nativity would be her constant companion in her labors, has had a powerful influence in her life. She was born in North Ogden, Weber County, Utah, a daughter of Lorenzo and Mary E. Barker Ward. She and Roosevelt Neal were married June 6, 1928, in the Salt Lake Temple, and established their home in Plain City. He and their nineteen-year-old twin children, Donald and Dorothy, have given wholehearted assistance to Sister Neal in all her Church work. She has always been interested in educational pursuits. She graduated from Weber Academy and Weber Normal College and has taken extension courses from Utah State Agricultural College, the University of Utah, and Brigham Young University. She taught school in Ogden and Weber County. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 Her bits of verse have been sent to many friends for Christmas, birthdays, in times of discouragement and sorrow, or as a kindly thought of remembrance for some service rendered. They have also added beauty and inspiration to many programs. Thoughtfulness, friendliness, a keen sense of humor, sincerity, humility, devotion to duty, love of God and all his creations, and a fervent testimony of the gospel are virtues which qualify her for the position of responsibility to which she has been called. Hosts of friends are saying, \"Coneratulations, Nellie. We love you. Thanks for your help along the way. You have inspired us with your faith and diligence.

    "content": "The Land of the High Uintahs Olive W. Burt HE Uintah Basin in Utah, with its surrounding country, is a magnificent, unspoiled area, parts of which remain almost as they were when the Mormon pioneers came into the Great Basin. Or you can go back further, carried by the remnants of old forts, inscriptions scrawled upon sheer canyon walls, names of mountains and rivers, to the wild, free days of the Mountain Men, or on back to the days of ancient Indian tribes whose mark is faint but unmistakable—or even go back to the day of the dinosaur. Truly, the flavor of age is nowhere else so pervasive and compelling as it is in the northeastern part of the State. The Uintah Basin is bounded on the north by the Uintah Mountains, one of the few important east-west mountain ranges in the country. It '5 a beautiful range, with the highest peaks in the State rising majestically into the unsullied sky. They look peaceful, as if nothing could disturb them, but they have known disaster. They have felt the great heaving upthrust that tilted them high above their old resting place; they have felt the clawing fingers of glaciers, scraping ugly gashes across their face and breast. But they have waited quietly, until the scars were healed with pine and spruce, with flower-enameled grass, and shrubs sweet with wild fruit. Above the 125-mile-long chain of lesser slopes, rises King's Peak, highest point in the State; with Wilson, Hayden, Marsh, and Leidy peaks and Mount Lovenia, all rising more than 12,000 feet. Below their snowy summits are hundreds of jewel-like, glacial lakes, fed by sparkling mountain streams, and teeming with trout and mackerel: Mirror, Grandaddy, Moon, Island, Pyramid, Green, to name only a few of the best known. While an automobile road has been built into this alpine region as far as Mirror Lake, the area iS really unspoiled and will remain SO, as it has been set aside by the Federal Government as a permanent \"primitive area.\" In the most frequented spots, such as Mirror Lake, the gateway to the Grandaddy tegion, Moon Lake, and Defas Park, accommodations for the less hardy are available—cabins, stores, lodging, guides, horses, and boats. But to get the real \"feel\" of the place, one has to pack in, sleep under the stars, eat campfire meals, in short, take the region for what it is—a throwback to days when what is recreation today was hard living. AS is to be expected, the rivers, born of the melting snows in these peaks, are not insignificant streams: the Bear, Provo, and Weber, and the Duchesne that feeds the mighty Green, itself a tributary of the Colorado. These rivers, making their inevitable way to the sea, have carved channels as varied as the waters themselves, from the bustling, trout-filled Provo and Weber to the terrific Green, with its Red Canyon gorge and Hideout Canyon more Page 441 442 Ais _ fy Olive W. Burt RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 MIRROR LAKE IN THE HIGH UINTAHS than 1500 feet deep, channeled through the rock, and Ladore Canyon, in ages past the lush feeding ground of giant reptiles. The heavily timbered slopes teem with game, and the marshes are alive with beaver, muskrat, and mink. It was the abundance of game that made the region a bountiful hunting ground for the Utes who claimed the area, and for the Shoshones who strayed that way, as well as for Priddy Meeks and his son-in-law during the famine times in the tiny, new THE LAND OF THE HIGH UINTAHS Mormon settlements further west. But it was the endless reserve of rich, furbearing animals that brought the first white men to live in the region. A few miles west of the ColoradoUtah border, on highway 40, is a marker honoring the \"first white men in Utah,\" Fathers Escalante and Dominguez. Father Escalante has left a rather detailed record of his visit to this area, but it was an exploratory trip, resulting only in calling attention to the region. The first white people actually to live in the area were the trappers and traders—that romantic, freefooted band of Mountain Men and those who followed in their wake to outfit and supply them. These men, who made a business of romance, left their imprint on this rich region, and the first year-long dwelling for white men within the territory that is now Utah was built by a trader. ARLY in the 1800's, any gentleman with sartorial aspirations had to have a beaver hat or two. The Hudson's Bay Company, exercising a protected monopoly of the fur trade in the North, was waxing greedy with wealth, when the Americans along the Mississippi, particularly in commercial St. Louis, began to cast envious eyes upon the fur business. General William H. Ashley and his associates turned their backs on the Missouri River to follow the Platte westward, crossed the Rockies, and came into the virgin land to the West. Many of these men are remembered in Utah place names, but here can be mentioned 443 only those that came into the Uintah region. Ashley \"invented\" a new system of collecting the peltries from his trappers and distributing supplies—a system called the rendezvous. At a. Designated time each summer, all company and independent trappers and Indians with peltries to trade, would meet at a planned spot. To that place would come the heavily laden pack train of the company. There would be a week of high living, during which the peltries would be sold, and new supplies purchased. At the end of the week, the trappers would return to their streams and lakes, with nothing but their kit for the coming season, and the pack train would return to St. Louis, even more heavily laden (but with peltries) and with all the money it carried out to pay for the furs, returning with them as payment for goods. The first of all rendezvous was held on Henry's Fork of the Green River, on one side or the other of the Utah-Wyoming boundary line, in the year 1825. In following years the rendezvous was set in other lush fur regions, but the trappers from the high Uintahs always made their way to the meeting place, loaded with rich peltries. In 1831 Antoine Robidoux came into the Basin to establish Fort Uintah on the Duchesne river. With him, it is supposed, was one Denis Julien, who carved his name and the date in five different places on the walls of the canyons, to establish himself as the champion inscription writer of this period. 'This post was destroyed by Indians in 1844. In 1837, Robidoux evidently built Courtesy, Utah State Historical Society RENDEZVOUS OF FUR TRADERS AND TRAPPERS another post, near the place where the White and the Duchesne Rivers enter the Green from opposite sides. Charles Kelly, Utah historian, has found remnants of such a fort and inscriptions of 1837 of both Robidoux's and Julien's names. After the destruction of Fort Uintah, the area was left pretty much to the Utes and the trappers who were too \"sot\" in their way of life to change, though Captain John C. Fremont and his men made a couple of trips through the area, with varying reports as to what they found here. Once or twice companies of \"Forty-Niners\" or other transcontinental journeyers would venture down from the Oregon Trail and cross the Uintah Basin, but these excursions were generally not very happy ones and did little for the country. In 1851, soon after Utah was made a territory, with a good deal larger RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 area than it covers today, the Uintah Basin was incorporated in Green River County (now in Wyoming). It remained so until 1862, when county boundaries were changed, and changed again and again, all into the present boundaries of Wasatch, Duchesne, and Uintah, with Daggett not established until 1917. Brigham Young, as Governor of the new Territory, was also Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and he created the Uintah Agency. It had a rather sketchy existence, and on August 25, 1861, Daniel H. Wells announced a list of names of men who had been called to go into the Uintah Basin and establish a settlement there. Brigham Young, explaining his action, said, \"Now I want a settlement there and I wish to pick the company. The Gentiles will take possession of that valley if we do not, and I do not wish them to have it.\" ' THE LAND OF THE HIGH UINTAHS THE advance group set out early in September, but soon returned, reporting that the land was good for nothing \"but as a hunting ground for Indians and to hold the world together.\" The plan for a Mormon settlement there was held in abeyance for a time, but just then Pres- 'dent Lincoln set apart all the fertile valley of the Basin as an Indian reservation, closed to white occupancy. President Young was quite upset to find his prediction of a few weeks earlier, fulfilled in this manner. The Indians in the Basin were generally friendly to the whites, particularly to the Mormons, but further east, in Colorado, there were a number of uprisings and massacres, and $0, in 1887, three companies of soldiers were ordered to leave Fort 445 Fred Steele in Wyoming and proceed down to the Uintah Basin, there to establish a fort for the putpose of keeping the Indians in hand. The soldiers came into the Basin from the north, and after a good deal of hardship due to their isolation from supplies, they finally built Fort Duchesne. Most of the buildings of the original fort have disappeared, but the community is still there, and is at present the headquarters of the Indian Agency. Meantime, a few Mormon families were seeking homesteads on the less choice ground available to them. In 1876, the Robert H. Snyder family moved into Ashley Valley and for ten months Mrs. Snyder was the only white woman in the valley. In 1877, John Fairchild took his famFrom a painting by Ramsey PAINTER'S CONCEPTION OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS OF THE UINTAH BASIN 446 ily in. Children began to be born there, and to die—and the Ashley Valley was a part—though an isolated one—of the general development of the Territory. In the winter of 1877-78 the first school was opened, and in 1879 new settlers poured in. The following winter was one of those cruel tests that seem to have followed the Latter-day Saint settlers into every new community, as if trying out their mettle before giving them peace to go ahead. This winter the only contact the little settlement had with the outside world was through mail carried on snowshoes by Peter Dillman. Peter Dillman is a name that appears everywhere in the history of the Basin—postmaster, school teacher, interpreter, guide, friend, neighbor. Keeping Dillman company in his activities were the Hatches, George Albert Glines, the Snyders, and others whose names still ring through the Basin. In 1878, Alma James Johnston built a cabin for his wife—not in the valley as everyone else had done, but up on the \"bench\" northwest of the settlement of Ashley. 'This was the first house on the present site of Vernal. In the seventy years since then, this community, the county seat of Uintah County, has grown slowly but steadily, with farming and livestock—and lately the oil fields to the south—to aid its prosperity. Westward in the Basin other settlements—Roosevelt, Duchesne, and Myton, grew up along the highway that crossed the Basin from east to west. There is no railroad into the area, even yet. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 ODAY, the Uintah Basin claims the proud title of \"Bread Basket of the State.\" It also boasts the only important veins of gilsonite in the United States. No longer inarticulate and isolated, it makes its bid for a place in the sun through co-operation and willing effort. The white citizens and their Indian brothers have joined hands in a sort of mutual admiration society, which has its climax each year in the Uintah Basin Industrial Convention. At _ this three-day gathering, both races display their crops and stock, their handiwork and crafts, their skill on foot and on horseback, their traditions and culture. All this has been written, and yet not a word has been said about the national monument up in the very northeast corner of the Basin—an area so unique that it draws the scholarly and the curious from all parts of the country. This is the Dinosaur Monument — the graveyard of the giant reptiles, where are found hundreds of skeletons of the prehistoric monsters that once roamed this high land. It is only a seven-mile trip from Jensen, on U. S. Highway 40, to this awe-inspiring quarry, where, in indisputable stone, the past becomes believable and real. A trip into this magnificent area of lofty peaks and golden desert; of quiet farms and mountains split into chasms; of thrifty white men and ambitious Indians—a land of contradictions and contrasts—will reward you with the \"feel\" of the past and the pulse of the present. The Jumpher Family Deone R. Sutherland Vi Nama and Papa T all started to happen when my sister Randy, whom my brother Richard calls \"Rancid,\" heard about Papa's new job first, and the intended move. We were out in the back yard throwing the trash that wouldn't go into our cans over into the cans in Anderson's back yard, since they weren't home. It's because we have so many children that we are always overflowing, Mama says. \"Gee, Rancid,\" said Richard, handling a big clinker like a handy club, should he need one, \"gee, Rancid,\" repeated Richard, waving his clinker, \"what did Mama say?\" \"She said, 'Under no condition, under no condition, could we all movel'\" Randy lifted her hand. \"Mama said, 'It's in the middle of winter, too. And _ the children, Hugh. What about the children?' \" \"Just tell it your way, not like Mama,\" instructed Martha Jane. \"Doesn't she put on?\" asked Richard. \"Rancid Barnharp!\" \"Bernhardt,\" I corrected. \"Anyway, she smells,\" said Richard. Randy went into the house. We went on dumping stuff and thinking about what was going to happen to all of us. \"I don't want to move,\" said Martha Jane, and her glasses slid off the end of her nose. I picked them up, wiped off the snow, and straightened them. Richard handed me a piece of string, and we tied them around her ears. We didn't say anything. When it got too cold to stand still any longer, we walked around the house, making a trail in the snow, stood under the cherry tree in the back yard, kicked at the stunted pine, and then picked up Martin and went in. Mama called Grandma on the phone and told her, but we weren't supposed to know yet. Then Grandma came to see Mama. \"You can't possibly give up your lovely home,\" declared Grandma. \"What are you thinking of to make a move with all these children? Besides, what would I do without my only baby in the same city?\" Grandma blew her nose on one of the long white lace handkerchiefs she always carries. \"You were never very strong, Kate. Now, you take a stand. Hugh's always had his way. Be firm. Stay here without him, if necessary. Oh, he's important enough to make other arrangements if he wants to. Oh, my poor, beautiful child,\" and she blew her nose again. Randy told us all about what Grandma said and, when Grandma went, she patted Mama on the shoulder, chucked Martin under the chin, but she never ever took him to hold, and drove away in her own car, \"Mama's Mama is very different from Mama, most of the time,\" said Richard. We didn't hear any more about Page 447 448 Papa's transfer unt] the next night. \"You had better mention it to them, Kate,\" said Papa, following Mama into the kitchen. \"T can't; you'll have to be the one to tell them,\" said Mama. \"You're the one that's breaking up our home. You're the one that's going away.\" \"It's not as bad as that,\" said Papa. \"I want you all to come with me. I need the experience in my work. We'll be back in—oh, no more than a year or two.\" \"All of us move? Leave our home after I've worked so hard on it. Leave my mother—my parents? I've lived in this town all my life,\" wailed Mama. \"But you're married to me,\" said Papa. \"We make the home together—\"",

Randy got out Papa's letters and read them. They sounded cheerful in a way. \"That's just to cover up,\" said Randy. She lay on Mama's bed eating the chocolate chips that Mama was going to make chocolate chip cookies with. \"Are they good for your hives?\" I asked. \"I miss him, too.\" \"Tf he were here,\" said Randy, \"I would even let him see me in the music festival at school, if I got over my hives in time.

I told you to have a small family. I told you not to let Hugh tear you away. Remember, I warned you against chasing after him. No pride—\" \"Never mind,\" said Grandpa, lifting Martha Jane up the step. \"I warned you, Kate,\" said Grandma. Mama jumped up the step house?\" I RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1949 and took Martin from Grandpa. She kissed Grandma. \"['m sorry to be leaving you,\" she said. \"I'm sorry to be going away for awhile,\" but her face looked all smiley. And we waved. Only a day and a night and a morning and we would be with Papa. The train began to move. We went in and sat in our seats. Randy had Mama's old Japanese fan which she held open across her face with just her eyes peering out. She was sensitive about having the hives. Martha Jane carried her dolls. Richard and I put Martin between us. We were really going somewhere. We were travelers. We felt very cosmopolitan. Randy said something behind her fan. We leaned forward, but her voice came muffled and she was being dignified. It didn't matter. We'd soon be with Papa and our family would all be together again. And for Papa's birthday! HE people on the train seemed very nice. One lady leaned forward and tickled Martin. \"Ooooo is sooo cute,\" she said. After awhile she lifted him up over the back of the seat. \"Oooo sit with me,\" she said. Martin reached up and pulled her hat down across-her face. \"Get the baby,\" said Mama to Richard. But just then Martin lost all the popcorn Richard and I had fed him in the station to keep him good. He lost it on the lady. \"Oh!\"' said the lady. \"Oh, dear,\" said Mama, and she went and got Martin. The lady went down the aisle to the rest room. When she came back, she kept looking very carefully out of the window. THE JUMPHER FAMILY We went in to lunch. Randy sat across from me. Everybody watched her eat while holding the fan. It got to be quite fascinating. Not once did she lower it. \"What shall we have for dessert?\" asked Mama. \"Ischree—\" said Randy. \"What?\" \"She said ice cream,\" said Richard, staring at Randy. He had grown quite respectful toward Randy and her fan. She did look different with it. \"Oh, look,\" cried Martha Jane. \"It's snowing!\" Everybody in the car looked out of the windows. It had begun to snow. We could no longer see the fields we were passing, and the little towns blurred in the snowstorm as we went through them. \"It won't be long,\" said Mama. \"Now, we'll go back, and I'll tell you lots of stories. And then it will be night, and tomorrow we'll see your father.\" \"But first we get to sleep in a box,\" said Martha Jane, sliding down off her chair. We went back to our car. Martha Jane hopped on one foot all the way. Richard bet me that she'd never make it. Randy held her fan and walked behind us. I knew she was pretending she didn't know us. She did that lots of times when we were downtown. \"Walk up with us,\" Papa or Mama would say, but Randy would lag and look away and pretend she didn't belong to all of us. \"It's her age,\" Mama would whisper to Papa. Randy would frown and try to pull her features so that she didn't resemble us. That would make peo-?? 451 ple stare at her also. Like now with the fan on the train. We went back to our seats. \"Now maybe Martin will quit chewing the upholstery,\" Richard said. \"Now that he has eaten.\" Mama held him on her lap, and he poked at her eyes and then tried to chew her buttons. She held him and let him see the snow through the window. \"Snow,\" said Mama. \"Snooooo!\"' said Martin. \"He can talk,\" said Mama. \"Did you hear, he can talk?\" \"Snoooo!\" repeated Martin; then he laughed. \"We'll tell Papa,\" said Randy. \"Won't Papa be pleased?\" said Richard. \"Snoooo!\"\" said Martin. And he kept saying it all afternoon and that evening. And when he woke up the next morning he said it. \"T like sleeping in a box,\" said Martha Jane. \"I want to always—\" \"It's too exciting now to read,\" said Randy. \"We'll soon be there.\" \"Say snow, Martin,\" said Mama. \"Snoooo!\"' said Martin. E got ready to get off the train. This was a big city we were coming to. The buildings stretched tall and white and dark. Martha Jane stood up and put her hand on Mama's knee. I would have, too, but I was almost too old. Then we had to get ready awfully fast, for there we were and there was Papa coming, running down the platform under the long, low roofs to meet us. He grabbed Mama and then us, and we stood on the platform and it was very cold, but that didn't matter. (Continued on page 462)",

Page 453 C— EDITORIAL 9 VOL. 36 JULY 1949 She lew Frontier ORE than a hundred years have passed since the vanguard of the Latter-day Saints first entered the wide and lonely valley between the Wasatch Mountains and the Salt Sea. They were pioneers to a land of promise and theirs was the task of subduing the arid Jand and of building edifices of faith and courage and erecting and sustaining the more lofty temples of the spirit. Our forefathers on that long journey to Zion were accustomed to sorrow and disappointment. Their campfire thoughts and their hopes and dreams along the trail were a weaving of grief for those whom they had left behind and a surge of hopeful beckoning into the unknown land. Their old homes had disappeared forever on the eastern horizon and they looked toward the West as pilgrims seeking \"the ramparts of the rocks\" for their protection. President Brigham Young, expressed his thoughts of the valleys in prophetic words: God will temper the climate, and we shall build a city and a temple to the Most High God in this place. We will extend our settlements to the east and west, to the north and to the south, and we will build towns and cities by the hundreds, and thousands of the saints will gather in from the nations of the earth. This will become the great highway of the nations. Much of the conquest of the land has been completed, in the home Page 454 valleys and even in the far-off places. There are few unknown regions to beckon the pioneers of today. Our generation faces a new fromier that requires an even more elusive accomplishment. To us and to our children have been given the task and the duty of retaining in its strength and purity the gospel heritage which our forefathers cherished through tribulation. And it is our further responsibility to use our time and our energy, the allotted span of our lives, to help in the great work of directing the minds of men and women towards the rich spiritual life which is gained through brotherhood, through being keepers of not only our own eternal destiny, but through being also of service in the spreading of the message of Jesus, which must be exemplified at home and carried to the far frontiers. It is, perhaps, an easy and an accurate accomplishment to measure — that yield of grain which has been secured from the desert, but who is there among us capable of measuring the harvest that may come from a spiritual planting? These seeds develop less certainly and may require a greater length of time for their maturing. And we who seek a new frontier must go forward with great courage and with the inspired devotion of the true pioneer who sees not only the near goal, but the long road that reaches beyond this world.

Grant, finds much pleasure and contentment in the sunset time of her life. Comfortable and happy in her pleasant home high above City Creek Canyon and Memory Grove, Salt Lake City, Sister Grant often sits at her window looking out upon the valley and the gleaming lake, thinking, perhaps, of the part she and her family have played in the development and growth of the city and Church. Sister Augusta, as she is lovingly called, is a precious link to the past, for she was so much a part of her husband's life that she still seems to be inseparably joined to him in the affections of Church people. She has many friends and a large family who make her days bright with remembrances, telephone calls, and visits. Relief Society women throughout the Church wish her a happy birthday and many days of contentment among the people she loves.

In the coming months Sister Judd will present other suggestions suitable to particular seasons.—Ed.] Sable Settings for the Canyon E love to go into our canW yons—not only because they are so beautiful, but because of the complete change from our ordinary surroundings which the scenery gives. Just as your guests enjoy wearing casual clothes for your canyon party, so they will welcome original ideas in your table settings to enhance the satisfying food which robust canyon appetites call for. So this month I want to talk about table settings suitable for out-of-door picnics, or to be used in canyon and country homes. It is in our family log cabin at Brighton in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah, that most of my activities have centered, so I am asking you to pardon me if I become a bit personal. | One affair that I shall never forget, because of the complications preceding the dinner, took place at the M. I. A. Home at Brighton. I had planned a pioneer theme since the date was near July Twenty-fourth. When I arrived to set the long table in the dining room, I found, to my consternation, that a meeting of the general boards of the Y. W. And Y. M. M. IA. Was in_ progress there and would continue for some time. What to do? It was suggested Page 456 that there were some window shutters stacked away for the winter. Could we improvise a table by placing these shutters on wooden sawhorses? We did! I tried to use wrapping paper in place of a cloth, but the shutters were so wide that, even by using two strips of paper the length of the table, there was a gap of about seven inches in the center. Fortunately, I had planned to decorate with covered wagons, miniature bonfires, and pioneer dolls. I quickly ran outside, shoveled up some loamy soil, generously sprinkled with dry pine needles, and made a realistic road down the center of the table. The covered wagons and the bonfires looked quite at home. These latter were made by placing dry twigs in the form of a tepee with bits of orange and yellow cellophane tucked under the twigs to simulate fire. A stick of burning incense placed in the top of the twigs made a spiral of smoke. Place cards were bits of sagebrush tied with calico bows. An idea which I have used over and over, varying the central theme according to my mood, is to make an out-of-door scene for the center of the dinner table in the cabin at Brighton. The base is nothing more nor less than a large square of gal- TABLE SETTINGS AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS vanized iron salvaged from an ancient washing machine. (The machine, long since useless for its original purpose, makes an excellent coal bin.) It has been such fun when on a tmp, to pick up some quaint little object for our canyon table setting. From Yellowstone Park came several little incense burners in the form of log cabins and a tiny bear to stand under a miniature pine tree. Ever so small Indian baskets and Pieces of pottery were found in Mex. Ico. There are even some little rubber donkeys, with natives astride, from faraway Haiti. Some of my most prized possessions have come from the \"five and ten.\" Here | found metal sets of cowboys and Indians and some very realistic bits of rustic fence to arrange as I choose. From Bethel, Maine, the home of my maternal pioneer ancestors, came some little birch canoes to float on our make-believe lake. HE lake is made of a Piece of broken mirror with plaster of Paris, painted tan, encircling it. The entire piece of metal that we use on the table is covered with green moss which we gather a short time before the guests arrive so that it will keep 457 fresh and moist. There are always a few tiny wild flowers available, such as buttercups and forget-me-nots, with which to dot the moss. A few colorful rocks, bits of bark, and treelike twigs complete the setting for whatever figures we decide to use. Wild flowers always make a lovely canyon centerpiece. I especially love a patriotic combination of red Indian paintbrush, white columbines, and bluebells, and they come as if ordered just right for the month of July. But sometimes it happens to be just between seasons. This will give your Imagination a chance for free play. The oddest idea I ever used was one summer when it rained overly much, with the result that flowers were scarce. There were, however, quantities of toadstools and mushrooms, with their umbrella-shaped caps delicately tinted in mauves, creams, and rose colors. These, with moss and rocks, made an unusual and really beautiful table. I remember particularly the huge fungus which measured a good ten inches across and held lighted tapers.

    "content": "The Tasks of Modern Citizenship Dr. G. Homer Durham Head of Political Science Department, University of Utah Render therefore unto Caesar the thin things that are God's (Matthew 22:21). HE incident calling forth this statement of Jesus may be forgotten. But the force of the message involved carries down to modern times. What things shall be rendered unto Caesar? What loyalties? What demands may modern government make upon the individual in the name of the State? What things are due only to God? Conversely, what are the rights of the individual, if any, in the State? In the Church? What demands may the Church properly make upon the individual, with what methods? Should teligious organizations, the churches, set the example for modern governments in dealings with the individual? Most men would agree that an ideal religious institution should properly set the example, not only by precept, but by living institutional practice. The eleventh article of faith declares: We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may. The twelfth article of faith Says: We; believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in gs which are Caesar's; and unto God the General (D. & C. 134:2) suggests that the following human tights should be held inviolate: 1. The free exercise of conscience 2. The control of property 3. The right to life These doctrines require respect for God and Church, for the State and government, and also for the individual. The worth of the individual soul and its free agency teceive the highest of all values in the gospel. As God respects the rights of man and \"will force no man to heaven,\" so the restored Church claims no prerogatives of social action over the minds or Bodies of men. The Declaration on Governments and Laws treserves to the Church a single sanction or enforcement power—the power of excommunication. And as 'Thomas Jefferson once wrote, such action \"neither picks my pocket nor bites my leg\"—although serious social, economic, and physical consequences may follow spiritual loss. Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants says \"Amen to the priesthood or the authority\" of any man who undertakes to exercise unrighteous dominion over the souls of men. The Church, in its own 'government, not only respects the individual rights and testimony of the membership, but in applying rules of Church discipline and govPage 507 508 ernment, utilizes the doctrine of common consent as revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. (See D. & C. 20:65, 67, 81-82; 26:2; 28: 10-13; 41:2; 107:12, 27, 32, 82-84.) Thus, properly developed, the restored Church respects the individual rights of man, individually, and collectively. Although the Priesthood ls _restored and could function as Priesthood, the Church as a Church, modem revelation makes clear, cannot function as a church without the law of common consent and the free, voluntary support of its members. This doctrine provides an excellent example and parallel for the tasks of modern citizenship. For, without indi vidual rights, there could be no effective citizenship. A_ totalitarian church could not qualify as the true church, respecting the free agency of man. Similarly, a totalitarian State substitutes abject obedience and slavish consent for intelligent, active citizenship. 'The probation of man, the gospel plan, requires freedom of conscience as the basis of both Church membership and citizenship. The Lord's respect for the things of Caesar is only another way of indicating his divine respect for the free agency of man as a fundamental truth. HAT shall be rendered unto Caesar? Can Caesar command anything? And then, must we obey? 'The answer is that the State cannot, if the nghts of man are respected, require men to do anything and_ everything. 'The rights of individual freedom of conscience, property, and life should RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 be held inviolate by the State. Beyond this, with the implication that governments rest on the consent of the governed, we are obligated to obey the laws of the land —provided (D. & C. 134:5) that they meet two tests: (1) conformance to the public interest; (2) respect for, and holding sacred, the freedom of conscience. 'The tasks of modern citizenship involve, therefore, two fundamental considerations: First, the citizen must have sufficient discernment to understand the true sphere of the State. He must see that governmental activity always respects freedom of conscience and meets the public interest. Lawmaking, or any political activity, contrary to freedom of conscience, for any child of God, should be opposed. This is a citizenship task of preventive, negative character. 'The second, or positive aspect, is to see that laws are framed and administered \"for the good and safety of society\" (D. & C. 134:1). This positive, affirmative aspect leads to a related major task of modern citizenship, namely, \"obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.\" In order to influence and positively use freedom of conscience, we must learn our rights and duties as citizens. President John Taylor taught that it was as important for us to study political principles as to study religion, \"to know and comprehend the social and political interests of man, and to learn and be able to teach that which would be best calculated to promote the interests of the world\" (The Gospel Kingdom, pp. 297-298). THE TASKS OF MODERN CITIZENSHIP How might this be done by a member of Relief Society? Membership of the Relief Society is international. The following references to American practice, therefore, though local, are typical of practices in other nations. First, it is the duty of a member of the Relief Society, if pos: sible, to qualify as a voter. In the American states the qualifications vary from state to state. In Utah the basic requirements include age, residence, and registration. One must be twenty-one years of age or upwards, have been a citizen of the land for at least ninety days preceding the election, have resided in Utah for one year, in the county four months, and in the precinct sixty days. Property qualifications are expressly forbidden by Article IV, Section 8, of the Utah Constitution. Many people fail to qualify as voters, usually by failing to register. Then many fail to exercise their franchise on election day. In the Salt Lake City municipal elections as few as twenty per cent of the voters sometimes participate. This means that a mayor and city commission may be elected by an organized minority of as few as ten per cent of the qualified voters! In general Presidential elections, Utah leads the forty-eight American states in the percentage of qualified voters who go to the polls, around eighty per cent. But in municipal affairs, school board, and other by-elections, interest often lags. This often means great power for those groups which have the foresight and initiative to orThe | 509 ganize behind 'the candidates of their choice. Secondly, after qualifying and participating as a regular voter, an active citizen needs to consider the question: \"How can I influence the nomination of persons seeking election?\" It is one thing to go to the polls. It is another thing to determine whose names get on the ballot in the first place! In states having the direct primary and a simple filing system, as few as five people can nominate a person for public office. In other cases, a simple designation of candidacy by a single individual does the work, providing a filing fee is paid. In Utah the filing fee is onefourth of one per cent of the total term-salary of the office sought. Thus the filing fee for the United States Senate is $187.50, for Congressmen, $62.50, for Governor, $75, for a member of the State Legislature, $5. HERE are many ways to influence the nomination of officers. The oldest, perhaps most certain, and most influential in the long run, is to actively affiliate with one of the major political parties in your community. Someone has to decide who runs for office. Fundamentally, this is the work of the political party. But friendly groups can also wield a strong influence. Organization is the keynote to success in all political activity. This leads to a third suggestion. In many communities, outstanding women have formed non-pattisan or bi-partisan civic councils. In Utah, for example, we find the Women's Legislative Council, and Is a p ' frophet-State man, page 105) 4 member of the fami] » Many go to the sound in Principle, and entirely correct as 4 matter of Policy; but it has not Worked..\" 4 revolution ( Ogg and Ray, Introduc.

If no other address is known, one may write the \"Democratic National Committee,\" or, \"The Republican National Committee,' Washington, D. C.

    "content": "Making Our Homes More Livable Christine H. Robinson Member, Relief Society General Board HEE is my heart, my happiness, my home. Here, inside the lighted window, is my love, my hope, my life. Peace is my companion on the pathway winding to the threshold. Inside this portal dwells new strength in the security, serenity, and radiance of those I love above life itself. Here will I build new dreams— dreams that tomorrow will come true. The world over, these are the thoughts at eventide when footsteps turn ever homeward. In the haven of the hearthside is rest and peace and comfort. Thus, Abraham Lincoln summed up the true spirit of the ideal home. This is the kind of home we as Relief Society members want for our families—a place where consideration, kindliness, and happiness glow. We want our families to grow up in homes which are havens of security, builders of spirituality, stabilizing forces in an uncertain world. Rich and lasting pleasures come from creating a livable home. There are deep satisfactions in taking a mere house and building beauty, comfort, and charm into it, and in endowing it with the imprint of our personalities. Decorating a house is an exciting and challenging experience. It has ever been one of the deep inner urges of mankind to seek to make his place of abode more beautiful. Even the ancient cave men felt the need to make their shelters more than mere dwellings. They beautified their caves by etching and painting pictures and designs on the bare stone walls. Similarly, we today seek to enrich our homes with beauty. We strive to make them not only more pleasant places in which to live, but we want them to express the true personality of our families. Houses have personalities just as surely as do the people who live in them. The first principle of effective interior decorating consists in making sure that the personality of the home expresses the personalities of those who live in it. We cannot possibly be at our best in a house that conflicts with our personalities any more than we can be completely at ease with clothes that are illfitting and in poor taste. The more neatly our home expresses the personality of our family the happier and more contented we and our loved ones who live in it will feel. It is when we step out of role and try to pattern our homes after the Joneses that we set the stage for a feeling of frustration. Recently, I was in the home of a well-to-do Salt Lake family. I was surprised to find it to be a small, unpretentious apartment. However, it had been decorated in such a manner as to give it a friendly, homelike, and gracious atmosphere. I commented about the decorative scheme and the family told me that for the first time in many years they were truly happy in their surroundings. Previously, they had lived in a large house which had been decorated in the formal manner. Page 651 652 They had lived in this large house for seventeen years, but had never really been contented. Their elaborately decorated living room was used solely for entertaining and when they ate in their spacious dining room, they were almost afraid even to speak to one another. They hastened to assure me that they were always very proud of this house, that it was decorated in a grand and authentic manner, but they had never really been happy in it. Hey are fundamentally quiet, home-loving people and a formal house conflicted with their personalities. E want to create a home background in which we will be happy and at ease. The feeling we wish to create will influence the selection of the room's color scheme, and the choice and arrangement of the furniture. If yours is a quiet family which likes to read a great deal and listen to the radio, you will naturally prefer quiet, restful colors and furnishings. A home expressing novelty and _ sophistication would be out of place and disappointing. On the other hand, if your family is definitely the outdoor type, loving active sports, you will want your home and its furnishings to be colorful yet sincere in lines and type. In your decorating you will want to express the feeling of free, open informality and not fill your rooms with delicate frills and fragile knickknacks. However, if yours is a consetvative family, rich in tradition and genealogy, you might be quite unhappy unless your furniture and furnishings are of genuine period RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 design and your rooms are tastefully decorated with rare old china and glass. It is only when we get the true personality picture of our family firmly fixed in our minds that we can take the first step towards making our homes more livable. To make our homes more livable we need not make them pretentious. In fact, if our homes are to reflect us, they must definitely stay within the limits of our spending capacity. 'This brings us to the second principle of effective interior decorating. Our homes must fit our budgets. 'This principle was impressed upon my mind in one of the first classes I attended in interior decorating. One of my classmates was a clever, artistic girl who had a career of her own, but who had recently married a clerk in a small store. As a class assignment, she was planning her apartment, and for her bedroom she selected beautiful white velvet draperies and bedspreads. At the end of the school term we were all surprised when the instructor gave her a low grade. She had prepared a_ considerable amount of artistic work for the class, but the teacher explained that she had not learned one of the cardinal rules of decorating, namely, that our homes must be in keeping with our financial status. A third important principle of effective interior decorating is planning. Many of today's homes, like Topsy, \"just grew.\" I suppose that all of us, at one time or another, have bought items for our houses without any clear idea of what we were going to do with them. If we repeat this error too often we may not only undermine our budgets, MAKING OUR HOMES MORE LIVABLE but we may build homes that lack personality and unity. Only by following a carefully conceived plan can we make sure that our home decorating develops in unity and good taste. Every purchase of furniture or furnishings and every decision regarding painting, wallpaper, and color combinations should be made in accordance with a definite plan. By following such a procedure, we can avoid being sold things our homes do not need and which later we may want to discard. We can keep from being influenced by high pressure salesmanship and can avoid 653 the mistake of buying things just because they are in style or because our friends have bought them. Asa matter of fact, when the salesman tells us that \"this is the latest style\" or \"this is what everyone is now buying,\" then is the time for us to be careful. We want our homes to express our personalities and to fill our needs. The fact that a particular item or color is what everyone else is buying or is the latest thing on the market is no reason for our buying it. It might be just the thing we should avoid! I know some of you are going to say, \"If we could throw out everyCourtesy, C. H. Henders, Inc., Fairlawn, New Jersey Wallpaper is a decorative note in this small hall. By using the same paper in the living room and in the hall they are unified. 654 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 Courtesy, C. H. Henders, Inc., Fairlawn, New Jersey Space has been used to good advantage in this small breakfast or dining room. Thing we now have in our homes and start over, or if we could buy a new this or a new that, then we could have the kind of home we want.\" But, as we have said before, it is not the expenditure of large sums of money which guarantees a well-planned and well-decorated house. It's how we spend what money we have, and the thought and care we put into arranging and decorating that which we already have that brings the greatest satisfaction. ECAUSE a piece of furniture is old doesn't necessarily mean it must be dull. The use of a little imagination and some good hard work can completely transform characterless furniture. If we strip off the gingerbread from some of our pieces and apply a fresh coat of paint, for example, a semi-gloss black which is used so extensively these day, we will be amazed at the new life and beauty that may be brought back to these old pieces. Old furniture and furnishings should not be discarded until they have been given most careful appraisal and consideration. Often, drab, uninteresting pieces, with a bit of work and imagination, can be made into things of beauty and distinction. Those of you who have rejuvenated old pieces know the thnll that comes from creating something new. Simplicity is the fourth impor- MAKING OUR HOMES MORE LIVABLE tant principle of effective decorating. Simplicity must be the keynote of all interior planning. Simplicity, however, is net easy to achieve. It takes a great deal of thought and planning to create a room which is comfortable, beautiful, yet simple. Comfort, beauty, and simplicity, however, are closely interdependent and interrelated. Beauty does not mean mere prettiness and ornamentation. Beauty means \"that quality or combination of qualities in a thing which gives pleasure to the senses or pleasurably exalts the mind or spirit.\" Beauty uplifts us both mentally and spiritually and gives that quality which we learn to love rather than to tire of quickly. 655 After having considered the four fundamental principles of effective interior decoration: (1) Expression of personality, (2) Appropriateness to family needs and budgets, (3) Planning, and (4) Simplicity, the next step consists in using properly the tools with which these principles can be put into effect. Color is the first important tool we can use to give life and interest to our homes and a \"lift\" to those who dwell in it. Color is considered to be the number one element in decorating. It is the first thing we see and feel when we enter a room. We have all been in homes which impressed us as being beautiful. In attempting to explain them later, Courtesy, C. H. Henders, Inc., Fairlawn, New Jersey This attractive room, through simplicity and quiet restfulness. Harmony, expresses a feeling of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 ase * ioe oa Ons ie Be Oe cae. Be Courtesy, C. H. Henders, Inc., Fairlawn, New Jersey The proper choice and hanging of pictures in this bedroom help to add interest and unity in the decorating. We have found ourselves unable to describe what was in them, yet we know the over-all effect to be beautiful. The proper use of color, in most cases, ls the real reason for this effect of beauty. Color can change a dull home into one sparkling with personality. It can give us a feeling of peace or a sense of restlessness. When we have little money to spend, color can make up for the lack of good furniture. Color can also divert attention from bad architectural features. Small rooms can be made to look larger by the use of light colored walls and cool shades, and by painting the wood trim the same color as the walls. Large rooms can look more compact through the use of deeper shades of warm colors, or by using wallpaper of a bold design. Sharp contrasts can be employed in large rooms. They tend to diminish size as well as add interest: High ceilings can be made to look lower if they are painted a deeper shade than the walls. By the opposite treatment, low ceilings can be made to look higher. If a sofa or chair looks too large in a room, its size can be minimized by painting it or covering it with a color which blends into the walls. On the other hand, if we have something which we wish to emphasize, such as an interesting mantel or piece of furniture, it can be drama- MAKING OUR HOMES MORE LIVABLE tized by the use of a sharp contrasting color. OST of us have good color sense but we are afraid to express our tastes. If we are to decorate interestingly, we must not be afraid of color. Color is fun and challenging to work with. It is the one tool with which we can express our individualities. A wise combination of imagination and _practical application of color will add vitality to our interior decoration. It will give a feeling of zest and vigor to our homes. Color, of course, must be used with discrimination. Too many 657 colors in a room produce an effect of confusion. In your decorating, you should confine yourself to the use of three or four main colors and employ them in balanced proportions. For example, in a fairly large living room, you might choose a floral drapery with a gray background with shades of green and pink with yellow accents. The walls and wood trim might be in deep gray, the ceiling pink, the floor carpeted in blue gray. A sofa in this room might be in chartreuse, two chairs in deep green and one covered in the drapery material. With green lamp shades, this would be an attractive color scheme. Courtesy, C. H.

Small, as well as large rooms, can be decorated with single dramatic conversational furniture groupings. It may take a little more ingenuity and imagination, in a small room, to plan such a group, but by the use of a strong accent color on the piece we wish to dramatize and the grouping of the furniture around the focal point, we can achieve a center of interest which will attract all who enter the room. With such a grouping, our friends will not need to pause and wonder just where in the room they should go. Another obvious point to keep in mind in furniture arrangement is that care should be taken to avoid placing pieces where they might disrupt normal flow of traffic and make it difficult for people to move around in the room. Doors and main travel lanes within a room should be kept free from furniture obstacles. Obviously, in a short presentation of this type it is impossible to discuss all of the details and methods 659 that are important in creating livable homes. However, the principles of personality expression, appropriateness to family need, planning, and simplicity, plus the tools of color and room arrangement, if properly followed and applied, will do much to lay the foundation upon which pleasant and satisfying home surroundings may be built. Our homes are the focal points upon which a strong and spiritually minded society may grow. The home is so very important that even the devil himself, through the ideologies which he is now spreading throughout the world, is constantly trying to undermine it. As Latter-day Saints, we must do all in Our power to preserve and promote family unity. Anything we can do to make our individual homes more charming, beautiful, and livable will help to build the family unit and enable it to grow on a more solid spiritual foundation. The home reflects the heart and spirit of those who make it. It is potentially the greatest spiritualizing force on earth today. <> Nlosa lc Christie Lund Coles Mauve and bronze and crimson hills, Lying in the sun, Here is the mosaic ~ Saying summer is done; Here is golden proof that though Winter will be white, There has been a harvest For the longest night; There has been a pattern In stalk, in flower, in seed, Bread and beauty mingled, To satisfy each need.

I felt just a little like the man who is lord of all he surveys. My eyes traveled approvingly from the blue of the mountains that circled our little valley to the field that lay at the foot of the white clay hills. There I could see a little cloud of dust that marked the slow plod of the horses as my husband worked laying off the lucerne, so he could take the water turn at the end of the week. My husband! 'The words gave me a thrill just to think them. We had been married only one short month. And yet there was something a little strange and frightening in the word, sort of faraway like the look that came into his eyes when he looked at the land the way I was doing now. Pil just think of him as Tom, Tom with the blue, blue eyes and the kind, strong hands. Tom who loves me and is all mine. It was true I did not have to be jealous or afraid of 'Tom's love of the land. It was something we shared in common. My father was Page 660 a farmer, too, and I had always been his girl. I had gone with him every summer to the dry farm and he said I could handle a team better than any boy. He used to point out the wild flowers to me and together we shared the beauty of the wheat fields as they turned from green to gold. \"Biscuits,\" we called the wheat, laughingly. Yes, I was from pioneer stock, and a love of the land was born in me. In fact, there were a few things about this farm which might be changed for the better. All the fences and ditches where the willows and weeds grew, bothered me. I loved the clean sweep of fields that were miles long. Although, I reminded myself, we hadn't lived on the dry farm the year around, we had just camped there during the summer. So this farm would be even better—we would have our home here. My eyes traveled on down past the intervening railroad tracks and across to the field where my imagination already saw the beets standing green and a foot high. My gaze came to rest lovingly on the trees we had planted the week before. Tom understood that I just had to have trees and had taken time out from the spring work to help me plant them.

I opened the oven door in a hurry, but the bread was baking beautifully and the smell was gratifying. I was really proud of that bread. I wasn't like most gitls of eighteen, for, being a member of a large family at home, I had learned to cook besides cooking for the hired hands on the farm during the summers. I knew how to cook, or so I thought. \"What in the world are you going to do with all that bread?\" gasped Mary. \"Why, eat it, of course,\" I replied, puzzled, as I looked at the eight beautiful loaves. \"Why not?\" \"But that will last you and Tom, just the two of you, a whole week! I never bake more than five or six loaves at a time for all my family.\" Well, I'll admit I wasn't averse to not having to bake again for a week, The longer it lasted the better. But a little bell rang somewhere in my consciousness and I remembered the beautiful, fresh loaves Mary baked practically every day. And I remembered how well Tom liked fresh bread. It was lesson number one, and the first one on that long road which began with \"Well it's pretty good, but it's not like Mary makes.\" you see, in my case it was changed from \"like mother used to make.\" Tom had lived with Mary and Joe there on the farm for years and Mary was the best cook in the world.

'Today she was helping me put oilcloth around the lower part of the kitchen wall. Ojlcloth was so easy to keep clean. So we set to work with a will. We measured and cut, plastered the glue on the wall with Joe's kalsomine brush, and fitted the oilcloth in place. We smoothed the oilcloth on with a cloth and rubbed it hard to make it stick. It was fun and it looked pretty. I had painted the woodwork white, in spite of the warning, \"It will show every speck, it just isn't practical for a farm.\" I had made sheer white curtains for the windows, too, and stenciled bluebirds on them. At school they had said that I was artistic and I was pretty proud of myself. It wasn't every farmer who had a wife who could do that sort of thing. Mary said, \"The blue in this oilcloth just matches that in your linoleum and the bluebirds in your curtains.\" I smiled happily, \"Yes, in spite of Sister Rass.

    "content": "Adoption of Children Mary L. Dillman Former Director, Relief Society Social Service and Child Welfare Department N the United States, throughout the world, and throughout history, the adoption of children by foster parents, by relatives, and by friends of the parents, and by strangers, has always had its place in the life of society. During recent years in this country there has been a tremendous increase in the number of adoptions carried on through the courts. Adoption has taken on a new importance in the welfare of children. The reasons for adopting a child are many and varied, and sometimes they are not clearly recognized by the prospective adoptive parents. Motives are often a mixture of emotions, conscious planning, self-interest, and altruism. The basic reason underlying many adoptions is that bringing a child into the home will make a richer and fuller life for both the parents and the child. 'There are persons who wish to have an heir to carry on their names or to carry on their special activities, or who wish to have someone to rely upon in later years; others feel the need of an interest in life or crave the satisfaction of expending their emotions on a child. Interest in a particular child or a child of a relative is another reason for adoption. Persons who wish to adopt a child should recognize their own motives and the possible effect of these motives upon the child. Consider, for example, those parents who desire a child to take the place of one they Page 664 parents. Have lost. Their expectation that the child will resemble their own in personality may lead to unfortunate comparisons between the two children. Parents who cannot have another child of their own may wish, through adoption, to provide companionship for an only child. Adoption should never take place unless the child is more than a means of meeting the needs of the adoptive A child is a person; he has needs of his own, and he has rights. In order to safeguard the welfare of the child, the rights of the natural parents, and the security of the adoptive parents, social agencies are set up and authorized by law to handle adoption. The legally authorized agency endeavors to set up every precaution to insure the welfare of the child. Adoptive parents are carefully selected and children are not placed in their homes until a complete investigation has been made, consisting of a visit to the adoptive parent's home, checking references, a doctor's statement, and a discussion of the motives and desires of adoption. Generally, agencies do not place infants in homes where the parents are over the average, natural, childbearing age, usually forty years of age. Experience has revealed that adoptions of infants in homes where the husband and wife are over forty are not as successful as where the ADOPTION OF CHILDREN couple is younger. Religious backgrounds are considered, and attempts are made to match, as nearly as possible, the physical characteristics and racial descent of the adoptive parents and the child. Agencies give consideration to the financial ability of a family to provide for the needs of a child. It is important that the standards of living in the home reflect an understanding of all the conditions that will affect the child's health—good diet, satisfactory sleeping conditions, proper medical care. The physical condition of the parents should be sound, and there should be no danger of the child contracting diseases from them. The greatest need of every child is for a home in which there is a normal mother and father relationship, and in which he may have the benefit of a real family life with its background of affection and understanding of childhood and its problems, behavior, joys, woes, and doubts. Every attempt is made by the agency to select mature, stable individuals capable of meeting the needs of a child. CHILDREN placed for adoption come from many sources. 'They may be children from broken homes, either by death or serious illness of one parent, divorce, desertion, indifference, or lack of willingness to accept responsibility. Some of the children placed by agencies are children of unmarried mothers. Such a mother may place her child for adoption because of her youth, her inability to provide financially for him, or fear that both she and her child will become social outcasts. Agencies assist the unmarried moth- 665 er to work out a satisfactory solution to her problem, either by helping her to keep her child and face the community pressures, or by placing her child for adoption. Most children who are placed in institutions or who are being cared for by agencies in foster homes cannot be adopted. They have parents or relatives who are not willing to give them up. As a rule, courts do not feel they can end the nghts of parents who do not want to give yp their children. Unless these rights are ended, agencies cannot place such children for adoption. Agencies are reluctant to place a child who has parents or relatives who may be able to take care of him. Often children removed from their homes because of neglect still have strong ties with their parents or with their brothers and sisters. It may be best for them to hold onto these ties. Some children are like plants, they can't be moved from place to place. When you uproot them they are unable to fix themselves in a new soil. | The waiting lists for children in agencies are long. 'The number of persons who seek to adopt a child is far greater than the number of children who can be adopted. Even after an agency accepts a home as good for a child, it may be months or years before a child can be placed in it. Doctors, lawyers, friends, and relatives too often by-pass the agency in placement of children and, hence, many children who should go through an agency in placement never reach it. Heartache and uncertainty for the adoptive parents often result from the independent 666 placement where no knowledge of the child's background or his physical or mental capacity is available. Take, for example, the tragic story of one couple who chose the easy black market way to adoption. This couple were physically unable to have children of their own. 'They heard of a person from whom, for a fee, they could receive a child for adoption. 'The couple contacted the person, paid their money, and received a beautiful baby. For a time they were extremely happy, but several months later they discovered a serious heart condition which medical science could not cure. The child died, and the adoptive parents were far more lonely than they were before receiving the child. An experience such as this could have been avoided if this couple had worked through a licensed adoption agency. DOPTION is a legal process and is, therefore, controlled by laws and procedures that are intended to protect both the prospective parents and the child. The adoption laws of many states recognize the importance of delaying the final adoption for a long enough period to satisfy the court that the adjustment is a happy one. It is frequently impossible to judge the mental capacity of a young infant, and this period, before final adoption, affords an",

    "content": "Woman's Role as Homemaker President Belle S. Spafford (Address delivered at the afternoon session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, held in the Tabernacle, September 29, 1949): HE subject upon which I Shall speak this afternoon, namely, \"Woman's Role as Homemaker\" is not new; it has been brought before you times without number, both in general conferences and regular meetings of the society. It is an old subject but one which remains with us as ever important. President David O. McKay, in addressing a Relief Society conference a few years ago, made this statement: \"Although woman's life is filled with almost everything that is good and lovely, it is not difficult to choose the two activities that are paramount in her world.\" 'These he defined as homemaking and compassionate service. Unfortunately, this viewpoint with regard to homemaking is not shared by all women. Only recently, in contrast to this, I read on the woman's page of a newspaper in a column reserved for advice to women on personal matters, the following interesting problem presented by a woman: \"I am the mother of eight children. Ever since my marriage I have devoted almost my entire time to my home and to rearing my children. I long to do something worthwhile with my life. What would you suggest?\" Wisely the columnist answered: \"I know of nothing more worthwhile.\" To match this is the attitude of a maried woman with five grown, Page 724 educated, likable children, who is often heard to say: \"After all, what have I accomplished? I have sacrificed my own life for my children.\" Women today point with pride, and justly so, to their accomplishments in the professions, the arts, commerce, industry, education, and politics. We are grateful for all that modern progress has done for woman—her liberation, her education, her opportunities. We view with pride all that she has achieved. But with a more complete understanding of her mission comes the realization that, although she may wish to combine another role with homemaking, it is in her age-old role of mother and homemaker that she makes her supreme contribution to. The world. The work of homemaking offers to woman her greatest opportunities and her deepest satisfactions. It is here her creative urges may find fullest expression, her administrative ability develop most naturally. It is here her talents may be put to the most practical uses, and her skills function most freely. It is here that continuous claim may be laid upon her resourcefulness and ingenuity, and her intelligence find a constant challenge. It is here her spiritual nature may flower fully, and her character grow to its greatest stature. It is here her influence may be most potent and her contribution to society most effective. WOMAN'S ROLE AS HOMEMAKER It is a matter of deep concern that social and economic conditions today are effecting far-reaching changes in our homes and exerting a pulling power away from the home. They are enticing, if not forcing, many women out of the sphere in which they can find the most happiness and do the greatest good. 'There are many influences in contemporary life today which impinge upon the family and make it difficult for parents to maintain stable homes and direct their children aright. On every hand we read of the concern that is felt for our homes. To illustrate, this rather disconsolate picture of the American home was published in a recent issue of Family Life, the official organ of the National Family Life Association: As the machine age spreads its patterns ever more widely, we have taken out of the home everything that has to do with living. You can't be born there, die there, be buried from there. You can't be taught there, be sick there. You can't work there, nor learn a skill. And entertamment must certainly be found elsewhere. What is there left but a lifeless dormitory where one changes one's clothes and where food, prepared elsewhere, is served? OUR Church leaders have always emphasized the importance of our homes and family life-They have taught us that \"the home and family are sacred institutions. They are not man-made, but have been established by a kind Providence for the blessing of his children.\" President Smith has admonished us, \"You fathers and mothers who are rearing sons and daughters, don't 725 put off the opportunity that is yours to win them to a righteous life.\" President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Has told us that \"to the Latter-day Saint the home is a holy place. It has its pattern in the heavens.\" He has further told us: Each family unit here that is created by and under the authority of the Priesthood in the House of the Lord, is potentially another celestial family, another Heavenly Home, like to the one of which we are members,—a family unit that may ultimately do for other intelligences what God did for ours. President Clark has definitely placed upon the mothers of the Church first responsibility for maintaining our homes according to the teachings of the Church. In addressing the Relief Society sisters in a general Relief Society conference on the subject of \"Our Homes,\" he said: Need I point out to you Relief Society sisters where your high duty lies in all this;—your duty not only, but your lofty destiny as well?.... The great work [that of homemaking] is yours, yours by your very natures, which means by divine design and appointment. You shall fail in your mission if you do not do it, and the world will be lost. The positive concern of our leaders for our present-day homes is evidenced in the \"Message from the General Authorities Endorsing and Instituting the Family Hour Program\" in which they declare: \"The need for them [Family Hour programs] was never greater in the history of the Church.\" With this feeling existing with regard to homes in general, we are led to ask, \"Now, what of our individual homes—yours and mine?\" This is a time when it might be Nightly be.

    "content": "The Loving Friend of Children Preston Nibley N the fall of 1801, George QO. Cannon, first counselor to President Wilford Woodruff in the First Presidency and the enterprising editor of the Juvenile Instructor (a semi-monthly publication for the young people of the Church), issued an invitation through his paper to all those who had known the Prophet Joseph Smith, to write in their recollections of the great man, in order that a permanent record of their experiences might be made. Brother Cannon received several replies to his invitation, as a number of the early members of the Church were then living. These replies he carefully edited and published in the Instructor at intervals throughout the year 1892. I have before me as I write this article, a bound volume of the Juvenile Instructor, containing these interesting letters. Among the first to write his recollections was Jesse N. Smith, then president of the Snowflake Stake in Arizona and a cousin of the Prophet. He was only nine years of age in 1844, but he was intimately acquainted with his distinguished cousin. Here is one circumstance he relates: In 1843, for a short time, I attended a school taught by Miss Mitchell, in Hyrum Smith's brick office. Passing the Prophet's house one morning, he called me to him and asked me what book I read in at my school. TI replied, \"The Book of Mormon!\" He seemed pleased, and_ tak. Ing me into the house, he gave me a copy of the Book of Mormon, a gift greatly prized by me (J. I., XXVII, page 24). Page 728 This is only a small circumstance, but through it we catch a glimpse of the great man, stopping his little cousin on the way to school and Presenting him with a Book of Mormon. I wonder where that Book of Mormon is now. It would be a prized possession if it were in the Church Historian's Library. A woman by the name of Louisa Y. Littlefield, seventy years of age in 1892, wrote a letter to Brother Cannon, stating that she had been acquainted with the Prophet Joseph Smith. She was born in 1822 and had moved to Kirtland in 1834 when she was twelve years of age, and had seen the Prophet on many occasions from that time until his death. She particularly remembered her experiences while living in Kirtland and the friendliness of the Prophet. I will speak of a prominent trait of his character, which was perhaps more marked in his early career than was the case after public cares and responsibilities multiplied upon him from so many sources; I mean his natural fondness for children. In Kirtland, where wagon loads of grown people and children came from the country to meeting, Joseph would make his way to as many of the wagons as he well could, and cordially shake the hand of each person. Every child and young babe in the company were especially noticed by him, and tenderly taken by the hand, with his kind words and blessings (Ibid., page 24). The young Prophet, going from wagon to wagon, shaking the hand of every man, woman, and child, presents a picture long to be remembered. He felt that he was a friend THE LOVING FRIEND OF CHILDREN to all mankind. All the accounts that have come down to us testify that he was a sociable and friendly man. [N 1892, a Mrs. Margaret Burgess was living in St. George, Utah. She, too, remembered the Prophet Joseph and recalled several instances where the great man had touched her life. Her letter is one of the most valuable that was sent to the Instructor. I shall reproduce it here in part. My father, William P. McIntire lived in Nauvoo, at the corner of Main and Parley streets. He was a near neighbor of the Prophet, and a true and loving watch-guard for him in times of trouble. The Prophet was often at my father's house. Some incidents which I recollect of him made a deep impression on my child mind. One morning when he called at our house, I had a very sore throat. It was much swollen and gave me great pain. He took me up in his lap and gently anointed my throat with consecrated oil, and administered to me and I was healed. A little child would not forget that experience, being administered to by the man who had beheld the visions, and became President of the Church. But there were still other interesting experiences when she came in contact with the great man. Another time my older brother and I were going to school near the building which was known as Joseph's brick store. It had been raining the previous day, causing the ground to be very muddy, especially along that street. My brother Wallace and I both got fast in the mud and could not get out, and of course, child-like, we began to cry, for fear we would have to stay there. But, looking up, I beheld the loving friend of children, the Prophet Joseph, coming to us. He soon had us on higher and drier ground. Then 729 he stooped down and cleaned the mua from our little, heavy-laden shoes, and took his handkerchief from his pocket and wiped our tear-stained faces. He spoke kind and cheering words to us, and sent us on our way to school rejoicing. Was it any wonder that I loved that great, good and noble man of God? As I grew older I felt to honor and love him for his mission to earth in restoring the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But the most interesting incident that Mrs. Burgess related is the one pertaining to her little twin sisters. This story, in connection with our Prophet, will, I think, live throughout the ages to come. I shall reproduce it in full. Joseph's wife, sister Emma, had lost a young babe. My mother, having twin baby girls, the Prophet came to see if she would let him have one of them. Of course, it was rather against her feelings, but she finally consented for him to take one of them, providing he would bring it home each night. This he did punctually himself, and also came after it each morming. One evening he did not come with it at the usual time, and mother went down to the Mansion to see what was the matter, and there sat the Prophet with the baby wrapped up in a little silk quilt. He was trotting it on his knee, and singing to it to get it quiet before starting out, as it had been fretting. 'The child soon became quiet when my mother took it, and the Prophet came up home with her. Next morning when he came after the baby, mother handed him Sarah, the other baby. They looked so much alike that strangers could not tell them apart; but as mother passed him the other baby he shook his head and said, \"This is not my little Mary.\" Then she took Mary from the cradle and gave her to him. The baby Mary had a very mild disposition, while Sarah was quite cross and fretful, and by this mother could distinguish them, one from the other, though generally people could not tell them apart. After his wife became better in health he did not (Continued on page 760) E were having trouble with fabrics they were made o Our daughter, Clarisse.

Table, and when we got into the pantry we had our fun. It was a good thing mother didn't hear us laughing or something would have happened, for our parents were very strict and Puritan-like,' Grandma went on. \"Well, after that they made our home their headquarters, almost. We never knew when we were going to be put to the necessity of cooking extra potatoes, or increasing the batch of cookies. When they came the family added up to an even dozen. Mother was always glad it didn't go over that. She never liked the number thirteen. \"When they held meetings at our place I generally helped out with the singing, after we learned the songs of Zion, of course, and every time we arose to sing the same elder would edge over to me to help hold the book, as if I couldn't hold it myself. My brother George noticed how miffed I was and told me I was too independent and spunky and wouldn't give the man a chance. They were nice young men, to be sure, but I didn't care for either of them, especially that Frank. I told Amanda one day I wouldn't have him as a husband if he were the last man on earth. No stocky Englishman for me. No, never, not I! \"Oh, he was a gentleman. I saw that from the first, but I kept the cool air circulating about me all the time, but Amanda, well, I accused her of deliberately falling in love with Thomas, and she didn't deny it. 731 \"I couldn't forget the pongee dress. I went to sleep every night dreaming of it, longing for the soft feel of it against my body.\" LARISSE looked at Grandma, sitting in her habitual black, and seemed unable to realize that she had once been young, had wanted anything so very much. I said, \"Go on,\" though I was beginning to feel that I was going to lose in the argument. Grandma cleared her throat, her eyes closed as she recalled the past, and continued on. \"I mentioned it to father, but he said he would have more important use for our money and we girls must get along. I could see we were getting more involved in religion all the time. Mothers folks commenced getting cold and dismayed. (The idea of high-bred Americans getting mixed up with an outlandish religion like that!) But Mother stood firm. A new light had come into our lives, the light of the true gospel. We accepted it with all our hearts, for we knew we had found the truth, and when once that conviction took possession of us there was no turning back. Everything else seemed unimportant. We wanted to give up everything and join those who. Felt as we did, which meant a long, hard journey to the Rocky. Mountains, and that was our plan, so mother told us. \"The time for action had come. A few days later, after father had thought things through, he called us all into the parlor and said, '?'m sure, my dear ones, you feel as I do about the great step we are about to take in becoming members of 732 the Church. I have no doubt in my mind that we have been led in the right direction by our brethren, and that we are now ready for baptism.' \"T felt as father did. No one had any objections. There was a sweet, humble spirit present. And when I saw tears in mother's eyes, they told the story for all of us. \" \"Very well,' father went on, 'we will meet at Willow Creek tomorrow at four o'clock and have the matter attended to.' \"IT remember the day father sold our property, furniture and all, in one big lump. Mother kept some of her best china and the few clothes we had. \"Father used part of the money we got for our possessions to buy a covered wagon, a team of horses, harnesses, and everything necessary for a long, strenuous journey across the plains, according to the advice of the brethren. \"We were as happy as could be, all except Isaac. He squirmed a little, for he was at the beginning of a possible romance and hated to leave it. Of all my brothers he was the most congenial. As for me, I was going to miss the cakes of maple sugar. You see, my Uncle John Rudy had a large maple tree farm, and every year he made the juice of the trees into maple sugar cakes. We always got a good supply of them. I was so fond of them. I made him promise to send me some when we got settled, and he has never failed. I use it for Christmas candy. My brother George used to twit me about Frank liking maple sugar, too. \"We came to the valley in November, and the next March Frank RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 and I were married. It was strange that he turned out to be a merchant, a buyer for Z. C. M. I. When he went East on his first buying trip he asked me what kind of material I would like for a new dress. I hesitated to tell him, but when he had gone I wept because I was sure I had lost my last chance to get my pongee dress.\" \"What did he bring you?\" my waiting, wide-eyed girl asked her. \"Pongee?\" Grandma nodded. \"Yes. The exact kind I had dreamed of, and satin to trim it with. I had it made up for the Governor's Ball.\" \"Governor Brigham Young,\" | told Clarisse. \"Grandma knew him very well.\" 'OVES,\" Grandma assured us, looking actually young and pretty. \"Yes, I did. New Year's Eve turned off clear and cold. Snow had fallen the day before and settled down firm and slick. Cutters glided over the glistening surface bearing their occupants to the scene of festivities. Sleigh bells astride the horses' shoulders sent their cheery jingle out into the night air. \"Everybody would be _ there, dressed in their best. Brother Brigham expected it. The ladies vied with each other for a little added adornment for this crowning event of the season. \"Frank had been given the position of conductor and floor manager. No man was ever better fitted for such a place than he. He was the English gentleman, very pleasing in manner, firm, orderly, and efficient. He knew how a ball should be car tied on in all its details. THE PONGEE DRESS \"The hall was in perfect shape. The coal-oil lamps were filled, and their chimneys polished, the wicks trimmed so as to give off their best light into every corner of the room. The fiddlers were in their places, eager to set off the celebration. \"At eight o'clock sharp, Frank called the assembly to order. Prayer was offered by Brother Bell, asking divine favor and approval of the occasion wherein we might find happiness in the dance and the association of each other. \"The grand march began promptly at nine o'clock. I can tell you, my heart beat wildly when Frank bowed and offered me his arm. My hour of triumph had come. I felt like a queen in the wide, flowing skirt with its rows of satin folds. The basque was stiff with boning and had its share of satin, too. From 733 my ears hung gold teardrop earrings. Everyone said they had seen nothing like them west of the Mississippi River. \"To cap off a perfect evening, President Young himself claimed me for the waltz quadrille. As we passed the spectators, I heard people whispering, \"Where did she get that dress?' \"Yes, a dress can be very important in a woman's life. And dreams can come true if you don't give up,\" finished Grandma. She looked at Clarisse significantly and I knew the battle for a white or a pastel dress was lost. But somehow, I was glad, for what really shows off a dress to advantage is a radiant and happy girl inside it. I asked, \"Where did you say you saw that changeable taffeta, Clarisse, honey?\"",

    "content": "Ancient Rites at a Modern Wedding Martha Toronto President, Czechoslovakian Mission Relief Society N this modern, rapidly changing world, there is a small village in Slovakia, Javornik by name, that still lives and abides by old and ancient customs. The good people of this village are very proud of the fact that there have been no changes in their customs or costumes for many centuries. They live, in many respects, exactly as their fathers and great-grandfathers lived before them.. | A group of us had an opportunity to visit this strange and interesting village, as wedding guests at the marriage of a young man whose family is a substantial part of the citizenty of this town. We saw and learned of many customs that I, for one, had never dreamed still existed. 'The first and foremost is that the people live to a marked degree according to an old patriarchal order. In one house live four and often five generations. The old, old father is, of course, the head of the house. All the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren abide by his counsel and his advice. At his death, the oldest of his sons inherits that position just as in ancient patriarchal days. As the family grows, the house is extended, to add rooms for further posterity. The houses become quite large, and many people live under the same roof, The most wonderful part about Page 734 it is that they live in harmony and righteousness, according to the laws and words of the Bible as they understand it. They do not seek entertainment in dances, theaters, or picture shows, but rather spend their evenings in a family circle, reading the Bible and singing religious songs. They study and sing from handprinted scriptures, many hundreds of years old, dating back to the time when the holy scriptures were forbidden outside the church. The songs they sing are scriptures set to a chanting music, different from anything I've ever heard before. They sing a blessing on the food, as well as one of thankfulness after each meal. 'They seem to have a song for every occasion. The wedding to which we were invited was very interesting, first because of the costumes. The everyday dress here is a national costume. For the wedding, however, they wore their Sunday best. 'The women wear short, finely pleated skirts that are a bright yellow, worn over many full petticoats so they stand out and swing as they walk. Over the skirt is a white gathered apron with handprinted flowers all over it. 'They do this hand printing themselves, and weave all the cloth for their costumes at home. 'They wear white blouses with heavily embroidered collars and sleeves and over this a white wool waistcoat, also embroidered in yellow, black, red, VILLAGE MATRONS IN THEIR NATIVE COSTUMES unmarried women Picturesque head.

We assumed that the people were inside their houses because of the heavy snow falling. We soon learned differently, however. Upon entering the home of our host, we found that the house was full of not only relatives, but half of the villagers, feasting at long tables. 'The womenfolk were all in the kitchen pteparing the main meal of the day. On three or more work tables, one could see great pans full of veal cutlets, steaks, and pork roasts all in preparation for the big celebration. The women stopped from their labors long enough to give us a warm handshake and welcome us into the home. We were led into the main living room where about twentyfive men were seated at the long tables eating, drinking, and enjoying a good chat. 'They greeted us warmly, and we sat down with them in the large, low room, whose rafters nearly touched the heads of these tall men who had come to the wedding. 'The clean, nicely painted rafters serve as cupboard space for bedding as well as for colorful hand-painted dishes. Even the large, fluffy feather beds, and pillows that are stuffed up into the ceiling have a colorful strip of handmade lace holding the ends of the white pillow cover together. In one end of the room is the large, fancy stove that reaches to the ceiling, looking very much like a monument. After we sat down on the long bench behind the long table they brought us thick slices of country bread, cach slice about a foot long, with country-made smoked bacon fat, that looks like salt pork, which RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 we ate with the bread. That is the greatest gesture of hospitality among the peasants in this country, and it is surprisingly tasty. After this, they brought up plates of home-baked! Cookies, cakes, and pastries in every' form and shape and decorated with frostings, fillings, and whipped cream. 'They were delicious. As we met these people, one by' one, it seemed to me that everyone had the same name. Upon inquiry, I was told that the inhabitants of this village use only four male names, and four female names. To me, it was very confusing, but to them it is very sensible. For generations, the men here have been known as either John, Thomas, Martin, or Paul, and the women as Eva, Katherina, Anne, or Elizabeth. In case there are more than four male or female babies born in a family, they start naming them over again as John II, Thomas II, Eva II, and so on. ' At about eleven o'clock, the bridegroom came into the room, dressed in his light blue costume, accompanied by his goodman, or advocate, who does all the talking for him. 'The best man, as we would call him, asks the parents of the bridegroom to give him their blessing. 'This, of course, is granted, and the words used throughout the ceremony both by parents and best man are Bible verses, and some of them are chanted. After this little ceremony in the house, we all went outside to form a wedding procession, which was to march down the village street, to the strains of the town band, to the home of the bride. T was a strange procession, led by a group of the young male rela- ANCIENT RITES AT A MODERN WEDDING tives of the family. These young fellows, dressed in their light blue pants and white, fingertip-length coats, flaring slightly from the waist, embroidered in red, blue, and green, made quite a picture as they danced and sang along the snow-covered country road. Behind them came the town band attracting as much attention as the group ahead, but with the help of a drum and brass horns. It was the kind of an oldfashioned country band that one only reads about. It was interesting to actually see and hear one. Following the band, came the bridegroom, very solemn and setious, accompanied by his best man, who, in a respect, acts as his lawyer, and his advisor. Behind them walked the colorful group of young girls, with their bright costumes and gay headdresses. As they walked with light, almost dancing steps, their bright yellow skirts swung from side to side. Even the tiny girls, some only five or six years old wore these costumes, and they looked so sweet with their little feet in boots, and their yellow skirts swinging. Following the young girls came the matrons, whose dresses were somewhat more subdued and practical. The rest of the parade was made up of the wedding guests, including us, the foreigners, who must have looked strange in our modern dress of the western civilization. In this fashion we marched down the road to the home of the bride, where we found that more feasting and celebrations had been going on all morning. We entered the house, where the representatives or advocates of the bride and groom did all the talking, arguing back and forth 737 about the advantages and disadvan'ages of the marriage state. During their somewhat heated discussion about the merits and disadvantages of marriage, they spoke in Biblical terms, using quotations from Paul, and various prophets. They each quoted passages from the Bib. E on the subject, pro and con. Finally, the groom was quizzed on his knowledge of the Bible, which he knew very well, as does every inhabitant of this town. 'The advocates agreed that he was worthy to take a wife from the family and suggested that he choose his bride. First an old, old lady was brought in, but he said she was not the one. Then another, younger one, appeared, but she again, was not the one. In a moment the real bride was brought in and, upon the groom's request, the advocate asked the parents for her. 'The father gave his consent, upon which the girl went to her father, thanked him for the home, education, and all he had given her, and asked to be forgiven of all her wrongdoings. He gave her his blessing, and it was a very tender scene between father and daughter. Then everyone came out of the house, and the parade started back again towards the small white church on the hill. The groom still walked alone with the men, and the bride walked in the group of maidens. The gaiety continued, but the bride and groom were very solemn and serious. At the church we sat in the visitors' balcony where we could view all the proceedings nicely. 'The women entered the church first, and sat on one side of the room. 'The (Continued on page 761) | Saw Paricutin Ann Rich VER since the morning paper flashed the news that a fire- — and-brimstone-hurling — volcano was being born in the flat cornfields of Paricutin, Mexico, I was possessed of an insatiable desire to see it. My husband listened indulgently whenever I dreamed aloud about such a journey. Our young son smiled superciliously, advising me to go into training before contemplating so rugged a trip. Our daughter was totally unimpressed. In spite of the indifference of my family, the idea of seeing Paricutin continued to smolder. Four years later I was able to consummate my plans for the trip. As late as 1947 it was still possible to observe the prolonged birth throes of Paricutin, the Western Hemisphere's youngest volcano. On the 20th of February 1943, to the peaceful little farm village of Paricutin, Mexico, came the bewildering, disturbing, and soul-searing experience of witnessing the writhing agony of Mother Earth in labor. For these simple people it meant destruction of house, home, and field. The great Mother. Trembled and they were frightened. She knocked at their doors and they knew not what it meant. She gathered her mighty forces and warned that her time had come. Room and more room was needed for the birth, the birth of a baby volcano. And so, for these peasants, birth brought destruction. The four, long years of waiting came to an end and I left the border Page 738 behind and arrived in Mexico City whence the trek to Paricutin started. Here the final arrangements were made and early one morning we planned to leave Mexico City— that is, as early as the native driver, Salvadore, could rouse himself. He arrived late but, seeing that sunny smile all over his clean-shaven brown face, who could be angry? And even when I observed he was not driving to the open highway, but to the congested part of the city where he stopped uno momento (in order to pick up two more passengers not counted on), that same smile again completely disarmed me. Finally, under the power of Salvadore's cautious driving, we skimmed along smoothly and comfortably over splendid roads all the way to the flower-filled mountain town of Patscuaro. Here we rested for the night. HE following morning saw us on the last lap of the journey to Uruapan, which was to be our headquarters before taking off for the great adventure. 'These roads, too, were excellent, except that they climbed, twisted, and turned, each good turn being repaid by many other good turns. By noon we reached the summit. This was a breath-taking spot called Mil Cumbres, meaning \"a thousand peaks,\" and so it seemed as they spread out to the far horizon in countless, undulating, sea-green crests. From this vantage point we were able to see dimly a thin wisp of smoke coming 1 SAW PARICUTIN from the great spectacle we were soon to view at close quarters. Upon arriving at our Uruapan hotel, we had a hasty mid-afternoon cup of cinnamon-flavored chocolate in a brightly colored, tile-lined patio, filled with lush semi-tropical growth. The air was pregnant with electricity, garlic, and well-fed flies! No sooner had we donned the blue denim coveralls furnished by the hotel for the horseback ride to the volcano, than the torrential rains came. When Salvadore questioned the advisability of starting, the two Texans, our added passengers, voiced my own thoughts by saying, \"Hi, oh, Salvi, let's go!\" I, too, agreed that it be Paricutin or drown. The special automobile which Salvadore had engaged for the drive between Uruapan and the pony rendezvous, was already waiting for us. 'This heavy car, with extra durable tires, was necessary in order to carry it over the glassy rubble of the recently blazed road. Prior to the voicano's nativity, the approach from Uruapan to the little agricultural center in the valley of Paricutin was by mountain trail and burto back. Even after four years of tourist travel, the mountain trail could scarcely be called a road. We lumbered over wide ruts, crevices, ravines, washes, and steep grades. Only the weight of the car, coupled with the slow gait at which it tossed about, kept it upright. We riders within experienced all the physical discomforts of every disagreeable mode of travel. It was a conglomerate sensation of rides on camels, elephants, and storm-rocked _ ships. While I groaned and braced myself 739 wherever I could, the 'Texans were calling upon all the shades of Hades. Their steady flow of profanity was pleasantly tempered by a delightful Southern drawl. Angry rivulets, red mud, and the pelting rain were all about. What with the blinding sheets of water, I was beginning to wonder why I had not included swimming in my preparations for this trip. Each time our special driver dashed cross fissures spanned merely by two loose planks I was sure the end was at hand but, miraculously enough, he made it every time. LTIMATELY the rain ceased as suddenly as it had started and we reached San Juan de las Colchas, where we pulled up to the group of waiting Indians and their ponies. I no sooner crept out of the car than an Indian led his pony directly to me, saying in fairly understandable Spanish that this pony was the smallest and muy bien (very good) for me. I speak of his Spanish being fairly understandable because many Indians in remote sections speak their own dialects, so that to one whose ears are attuned to Castilian Spanish, theirs could sound strangely foreign. He called my attention to the nice, new, intricately tooled saddle. Yes, it looked nice. I learned later that its unyielding newness was nice enough to kill. After helping me to mount the pony, the Indian threw the reins to his son, about ten years of age, who was to lead the pony up the trail. The two Texans had already taken off on their ponies like ducks to water. Salvadore had started. Other groups of tourists were falling in- 740 VOLCANO AT PARICUTIN, MEXICO to the trek. I slowly followed to the mournful droning chant of the muchacho (boy). Leaving San Juan de las Colchas, we rode over a gently rising slope covered with damp, black ashes. I quite envied the muchacho the joy of trudging barefoot. Each step left the imprint of five little toes and a perfect arch. In a short time a stiff breeze came up and I fastened the braided cord of the sombrero under my chin. The hat served as a suitable windbreak as well as a rain shield. As I looked up I could see that Salvadore was keeping himself warm by galloping away at full speed. With his crimson poncho (blanket) billowing about his portly body, he no longer was the whitecollared tourist interpreter, but a child of the peasant tribesmen. That RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 was the last I saw of him for the next hour and a half. The climb grew steadily steeper, the light dimmer. Presently I saw one of the most poignant sights of the whole trip. As far up the hillside as was visible, there stood etched against a backdrop of black ashes, unburied, twisted limbs of treetops, stripped to ivory nakedness. This was the aftermath of Mother Earth's hot, spewing breath during her supreme struggle. Here they stood, transfixed, the silent sentinels of a new order. The unchanging dirgelike chant of the muchacho sent a deeper eeriness through me. From here we moved on to the edge of the lava beds, which were the exhausted masses of cinnamoncolored boulders. 'These were precariously heaped to monstrous heights by the powerful forces exerted from the adjacent molten lava. Both boy and pony now cautiously picked their way over the treacherous rocks, while I desperately clung to the pommel in order to compensate for the many shifting positions. Off and on, we would pass through heavy warm vapors and be momentarily enveloped. We continued to climb. Next we found ourselves in a furrow flanked by steep walls of serrated rock, rising to saber-like pinnacles. All this was once the pulsating lifeblood of Mother Earth. Gradually we reached the crest between two furrows. Here we were able to stand atop the surface-cooled ridge and view the countless semicongealed streams of molten lava which had careened down the valley nearly a mile wide and twelve miles | SAW PARICUTIN long. All that was once a settlement was gone. Only the twin spires of the elaborate cathedral remained, After an awesome pause in this weird atmosphere of death-like silence, the little guide led the pony off the lava beds, along an ash-covered path which zigzagged ever higher until we reached the summit. This hill from which we were to view Paricutin was about a half mile, as the crow flies, from the volcano. T was at paling twilight that I got my first glimpse of the rose-tinted cone, silhouetted against the darkening heavens. Rolling white puffs of velvet-like softness rose out of the crater, gradually to spread out into fleecy white clouds. Each new display of Mother Earth's fiery breath was heralded by resounding rumblings. His roaring came at almost regular intervals followed by a pause, and then fleecy puffs again, as if the mother were catching her breath for the spasm. To have said a word to anyone, even if I could have made myself heard, would have seemed - sacrilegious. How well these simple little guides understood, for they left us entirely alone to gaze and meditate. Dense darkness now enveloped Paricutin. The wonder child, swathed in colors of flame and white, was magnified a thousandfold. Off in the outer arc of the sky, as though keeping a safe distance, myriad curious stars came out of the darkness to blink and witness with us the prolonged pangs of Mother Earth's childbearing. Over and over she unashamedly roared, hissed, and belched forth fiery fun- 741 nels of blood-red fumes to be dissipated in the heavily laden, gaseous atmosphere. It was very dark and cold when my muchacho came quietly up to me with a boxed lunch. Lookin around, I could see that the other guides were doing the same. Soon Salvadore had started a small fire around which we huddled. No one seemed to have much appetite for food. The young Texans were hopping up and down to keep warm, throwing in a few cowboy \"yippees.\" Now and then they would lapse into a quieter mood and soberly comment, \"What a sight!\" During this time the guides got the idea of keeping us amused by running races down the ash-covered hill to bring back pieces of hot sulphur. In between runs they would happily accept any portions of uneaten food, and proceed to entertain with more races, wrestling, and giggling. Like children everywhere, they enjoyed holding the center of the stage. After this Salvadore pointed out a new aperture in the volcano. It was at the base, far removed from the crater, from which a wide flow of lava was pouring out. With the aid of binoculars we could see more minutely the mammoth - scarlet chunks give way, spilling and tumbling into the seething cauldron of blood-red lava-food for Paricutin's growth. GOMETIME later, thoroughly inspired as well as chilled, we reluctantly commenced the descent. This ride was to prove even more painful, for there were no new positions left into which I might shift.

    "content": "'Thanksgiving Day was not a harvest festival. There had been no reaping and there was no feast. 'Thanks were given for all blessings, and thus it happened that the first Thanksgiving was in the late autumn of 1620, before any seeds had been planted in the earth roundabout Plymouth. It is recorded that the Pilgrim Fathers gave thanks when they first sighted the coast of New England. During their journeys of exploration and their trips inland to gather wood and search for food, they knelt and offered praise for the safe arrival of the Mayflower which had braved the stormy Atlantic and had arrived on the shores of the New World. There, on the edge of the wilderness, they were conscious of the great barrier of the ocean, conscious of the separation of distance. They felt wonderment and curiosity concerning that vastness which lay beyond the \"stern and rockbound coast,\" and their strength came from a realization of their dependence upon divine guidance. Thoughts, clothed in the rhythm Page 744 of words, are long remembered and seem to grow more precious with the years. We are indebted to Govemor William Bradford for a lucid description of the end of a great sea journey, and the beginning of a new commonwealth. Being thus arrived in good harbor and brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed ye God of heaven, who had brought them over ye vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all ye perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on ye firm and stable earth, their proper elemente.

For summer being done all things stand with a weatherbeaten face, and ye whole country, full of woods and thickets, represented a wild and savage hiew. Such was the unwelcoming shore, and such the feelings of the Pilgrim Fathers on that day and in that year wherein the cornerstone of a nation was laid and the beginning of Thanksgiving came to America. For, as Governor Bradford so earnestly expresses it: Our forefathers came over this great ocean, and were ready to perish in the EDITORIAL wilderness; but they cried unto ye Lord, and he heard their voyce Let them therefore praise ye Lord because he Is good and his mercies endure forever, The Pilgrims had and they expressed their gratitude for a haven in the New World, a Place for the building of houses of worship, for the erecting of stately halls of government, for an Opportunity to build the material security and spiritual strength which are found a home, 745 necessary for the complete developfor us to Temember the words inscribed on monument, which, with ing years, become even More significant: \"What our fathers with sO much difficulty secured, do not basely relinquish,\" V.

Reuben Clark, Jr. Of the First Presidency [Address delivered at the afternoon session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, September 29, 1949.] ISTERS of the Relief Society: It is a pleasure to be with you, even though I have to talk. I have greatly enjoyed the meeting so far, and the instructions, the advice, and the counsel that have been given to you. You have a great mission, as you are told on all occasions, but you cannot be told too often, nor can you too earnestly remember it. I have always been impressed with the introduction that Webster made in his reply to Hayne. I have not read it for years. It is not wholly applicable, but at the beginning of his reply, which dealt with fundamental principles of constitutional government, he said that when a ship had been on the ocean, driven by winds and storms for many days, the mariner always took the first occasion when the heavens were visible, to take his bearings and find out where he was. Now, you have not been driven and wind-tossed since your organization. You have had the guidance of the prophets of the Lord, who have, from time to time, given you the instructions which they felt you should have. Nevertheless, remembering that introduction, I decided that I would go back to the beginning of your organization and acquaint myself again, somewhat, Page 796 with the circumstances under which you were organized. As you know, at your first meeting you were organized, on March 17th of 1842. During that summer, and until August 31, the Prophet met with the sisters rather frequently. On two or three occasions he preached really great sermons and he laid down for you the course which he felt you should follow. As I read a little something of the history of those times, I found that the summer of 1842 was one of the most difficult summers for him, personally, through which he lived. The infamous Bennett was in Nauvoo stirring up all the trouble he knew how to stir, and he was a good stirrer. [he Prophet was driven almost, apparently, to his wit's ends to know what to do. Bennett left Nauvoo sometime during the summer. During this same summer the enemies of the Church, and _particularly of the Prophet, in Missouri, sought to involve the Prophet in an attempt that was made upon the life of ex-governor Boggs. It went so far that they finally secured papers, extradition they called them, though not technically so, extradition papers to get him from Nauvoo back into Missouri, where, of course, they would have made short shrift of him if they could have gotten him O ster Spafford Tead howing What at summer jp 4volding the the home I NECEssity o Teturning ¢.

The Lord has said \"It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance\" and \"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will mse with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.\" The general board is proud of the courses which are designed to be presented this coming year. We feel that they are of vital interest and importance in the lives of our members, and trust that you sisters of the stakes will see that the true purpose of each course is attained in the lessons as taught in the wards. We wish to express appreciation to the writers of our lessons who give fully and freely of their great talents for the upbuilding of the sisters of Relief Society. 'Their reward, sisters, lies in the benefit and enlightenment which come to you and the other women of the Church, who study these excellent and outstanding lessons. Digest— Relief Society in the Lives of Our Sisters in &urope Nida A. Taggart Former President, Swiss-Austrian Mission Relief Society ask for the Spirit of the Lord and for an interest in your faith and prayers that I may be able to tell you what I have in my heart. I was able, from my mission, to gain a deeper testimony of the di- RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE vinity of Relief Society work and the effectiveness that it has in the lives of our sisters in Europe. It has been the shining light in most of their lives. These sisters in many of those lands where women have been given few, if any, privileges, have found in the Relief Society work their place in the sun. They have the spirit of mercy. They visit the sick and they never go empty-handed, if it is only a flower they take with them. They have little money to give, but they give their time and their love and all of their effort. They love the lessons. 'They were thrilled to know that they were studying the same lessons that you are studying here. 'They have some very fine class leaders. Everyone takes part. You know that love is the foundation of democracy, and, in these troubled times in Europe, what greater gift could we give those women than our wonderful Relief Society program and to bring them the gospel of Jesus Christ? Never in the history of our mission have the doors been opened to us as they are at present. In Germany, Sister Wunderlich is doing a magnificent work in bringing order out of chaos. She has brought those sisters together. When they had a convention in Frankfurt, they displayed twentyfive thousand articles of clothing that their sisters had made out of materials from the welfare clothing that needed re-making. They were feeling that they, too, had their welfare project, and they are beginning to be able to help themselves. The Swiss sisters were not hurt 801 by the war, yet they were very active and eager to help their less fortunate neighbors. 'They gathered clothing and food and gave their precious food coupons in order to send food and clothing to Germany and Austria. Every member child in Austria was brought into Switzerland and cared for in the homes of our sisters. 'They were cared for from three to six months, fed and clothed and rehabilitated. It was a marvelous thing for our sisters to do. In that first winter, the winter of 1947, Our wonderful Relief Society president in Vienna had a little plot of ground an hour and a half out from the center of the city. She traveled out there every day to take care of that plot of ground herself. She planted and harvested those potatoes and she harvested enough to help every family in that branch. She said to me: \"Sister 'Taggart, it was like the story of the loaves and the fishes. I have never harvested as many potatoes before or since.\" As mission wives in Europe, the wives of the mission presidents are doing a magnificent job. I would like to pay tribute to them here. Those sisters in Europe would love to join the body of the Church. I think in every one of their hearts is that wish sometime to come to Zion, but next to that is the thought that they are a part of this great Relief Society organization, that they are doing all they can to further the work of the Lord in those countries. May he bless them with everything they need, that they may have courage and faith, whatever may come, I pray.

We wi Page 804 RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE to get the benefit of your suggestions also, as you find effective ways of teaching. Last month, in our meeting in the Temple, President Clark made the statement that he had spent several years down in Mexico among the Lamanites, the pure-blooded Indians, and also the Mexicans. He found that they have a greater discernment than we do, generally. If you think with just an outward show of friendliness, you can go into their lives, you are badly mistaken. An Indian can see through you clear into the heart, and he knows whether you are friend or foe. Now sisters, the most important thing in this whole Indian program, as I see it, is education, divided into two phases. The first phase is education of the Latter-day Saints at home, some of whom need their hearts opened, cleansed and purged and purified and made ready to accept the program. And phase two is the proselyting of the Lamanites themselves. The scriptures are filled with prophecies in connection with this people. Why, there are few subjects on which there is so much revealed. The prophecies must, and will be fulfilled. They can be fulfilled only by our help. We must go out and do this work. Now, we have tried segregation of the Indians in this nation for a hundred years. It did not work. Segregation has been almost a complete failure. Many of them are still \"blanket\" Indians,-after a century of segregation. The program of the Church must be one of assimilation and integration. We must take them into our arms, into our 805 hearts, into our Relief Societies, into our sacrament meetings, into our Sunday Schools, into our Primaries, into our Mutual, and into our hearts. I am reminded of what Peter said. You remember he thought the gospel was for the Jews only. The Lord revealed that the gospel was for gentiles as well, but the Jews could hardly believe it. 'They, including the apostles, had grown up with the thought all those years, that the gospel was for the Hebrews and that the Samaritans and all the other groups of those Gentiles along the Mediterranean coast were not clean. And then you will remember in the vision Peter saw all the reptiles and the beasts of every kind, and Peter said \"... God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\" I think the Lord put the reptiles and the snakes and the beasts all in this vision, so that Peter would know the extent of the inclusion and that there was no one to whom the gospel should not come, even the poor and the degraded and the unclean, and so he finally received his testimony. And he went about preaching the gospel to the gentiles. Some of his own brethren, even in the Council of the Twelve, began to argue with him, and finally Peter said to them: \"What was I, that I could withstand God?\" Now, sisters, the Lord has shown that he is willing to accept the Indian. Who are you and who am I, that we can withstand God? 'The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants are full of revelations indicating that these people must receive the gospel and that 806 God does and we must, accept them. Sisters, we must come to a program of assimilation and integration, and we must learn the lesson that Peter learned, and that others have had to learn. \"Unwashen hands\" is no crime. It is a crime to have unwashen souls. You remember how the Pharisees, with vile hearts, would not eat with Christ's disciples with \"unwashen hands.\" If you had committed no greater sin than these particular Indians have who are living today, the sin of being descendants of those who sinned, how would you feel about it? Would you cry for deliverance? Would you grope for light? Would you think that perhaps you had paid your penalty and that now you should be given consideration and brought back into the world of the living? In today's paper, there is the testimony of Sister Sundust. May I quote just a few lines from her. She said: I am proud to be a Latter-day Saint. You know, in my years there is always fear and doubt, not only me, but the tribe of the Maricopa Indians living eighteen miles from here between the Gila and Salt Rivers. There were other missionaries that came there, but they didn't go far. They don't tell the right way nor the truth and I drift away. From there on there was always doubt in my mind whether there was a living God and his Son, Jesus Christ. And then, finally, one day your people came around. And now she is a member of the Church, with her children. \"THE Indians are calling for the gospel; they are begging for it. Bear your testimony to them and the Lord will magnify your testimony, and it will be recorded in the heavRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 ens for the angels to look upon, and it will bear fruits. Your testimonies and the simple explanation of the gospel of Jesus Christ will win many converts. Remember this, sisters: If the Indians had all that was rightfully theirs they would not be where they are and we would not be where we are. Remember that. We are here through the grace of God, and do not forget it. 'The Lord gave us to share an inheritance with the Indians in this glorious land which is choice above all other lands in all the world. But it is ours only on the condition, as I see it, that we do our part in seeing that these people come into the Church. What the Lamanite needs is opportunity. The only difference between us and the Indian is opportunity. Give them an opportunity, sisters, so that they, too, can enjoy the blessings that you do. And take this message back to your people in the stakes, that they leave off their racial prejudice. Racial prejudice is of the devil. Racial prejudice is of ignorance. There is no place for it in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have read to you some of the scriptures indicating this. Now, sisters, I could talk to you for hours about the problems and destinies of these people who occupy so much of the thoughts of my working hours and even share in my dreams of the night, but may I leave this one thought: The Lamanite has suffered much and long for the sins of his fathers far beyond the third or fourth generation. He is now responsive to the gospel and is entitled to it. He will not receive it without RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE our help. We must not fail him. We must accept, fraternize, and fellowship him, and cease to spurn and hiss him. And I say it again and again to all of us, as did Peter, who are we that we can withstand the plan 807 which the Lord God of Heaven has established for them? Who are we to say who is unclean, who has \"unwashen\"' hands? May you do all in your power, with a great enthusiasm, to fulfil] the promises of God, I pray. OFFICERS MEETING THURSDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 29, 1949 Digest—Report and Official GDnstructions General President Belle S. Spafford a you a ONCE again it becomes privilege to present to brief report of the status of Relief Society, this time for 1948. Our hearts are filled with gratitude to our Heavenly Father, and to the splendid women who have made possible the growth of the society in all of its aspects. We acknowledge the wonderful support and direction that have come to us from the Priesthood authorities. General and Stake Boards € have at present twenty-three members of the general board. Since our last conference it has been necessary to release two of our beloved and capable board members, Sister Priscilla L, Fvans and Sister Florence G. Smith. Only one board member has been appointed since last October, Sister Nellie W. Neal, former president of the Farr West Stake, who was named to the general board in May 1940. We have at present stake board organizations in all of the one hundred Seventy-four stakes of the Church, with Relief Societies in all of the forty-four missions of the Church except two, the Japanese and the Chinese Missions. | Work in Missions We are now receiving annual reports and hearing regularly from all] of the missions, Including the foreign-speaking missions. We are encouraged by the growth of the mission Relief Societies and by the spirit with which the work is conducted there. More and more the Mission societies are conforming to the uniform Program of Relief So. Ciety, and are striving to conduct their work in accordance with recommended procedure. The general board is beginning to build up a foreign language department of lessons, and has asked the Missions to supply copies of all translated Relief Society lessons. We believe this wil] Prove of inestimable value in the future. Are also asking them, as well as you sisters in the stakes, to keep on hand a copy of A Centenary of Relief Society and the Handbook of In. Structions as well as bound volumes of The Relief Society Magazine. Membership and Attendance The membership of Relief Society was increased during 1948 by 3,843 women, giving usa total mem bership of 115,686 members as of De- 808 cember 31, 1948. Sisters, as long as I preside over the society, you will hear of the importance of extending the blessings and benefits of mem. Bership to every Latter-day Saint woman. Visiting Teacher Messages We commend you most heartily for your continued efforts in strengthening and extending the visiting teaching services. The quality of the work continues to improve according to frequent reports received at the general office and the messages are well received by both visiting teachers and the women in the homes. The delivery of the message remains of vital importance even though reports of the number of homes in which the message was presented have been discontinued. Family Visits Compassionate services show a substantial increase and the sisters continue their loyal support of the Church Welfare Program. The study of a family situation for the purpose of determining its problems and its needs should be carefully, intelligently, and unhurriedly made. Usually it is not possible in a single visit to understand the family, its basic problems, and the resources within it, For this reason we recommend to you a careful consideration of follow-up visits and their value. Even when the need for help has ceased, we would recommend that the friendly interest of the president continue to be expressed through visits to the home. Service by Those Assisted We urge a continuation of your efforts to have the sisters visited by RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 Relief Society presidents under the direction of their bishops, contribute service to the Welfare Program, and do their own sewing wherever possible. In assigning the 1950 clothing budget the general committee ls recommending that only a portion of it be made up into articles of clothing, and that the remainder be held in yardage in the storehouse for distribution on bishop's orders to families who may be able or who can be taught to do their own sewing. Fund-Raising Activities Reports show the society, as a whole, to be in good condition with respect to finances. Funds appear to have been raised judiciously and expended wisely. F und-raising activities have been, in general, in keeping with the standards and dignity of Relief Society, and they have, in large measure, been the out growth of the regular Relief Society program, or a reflection of it. This the general board fully endorses and would encourage. Relief Society Not a Selling Agent We are aware that you are occasionally approached by commercial institutions or by individuals for the purpose of having you sell their product on a commission basis. Such an undertaking should be weighed carefully and the counsel of the Priesthood should be sought. Care must be exercised to make sure that Relief Society does not become a selling agent, and that people are not solicited in the name of the society to the point where the society becomes subject to criticism. Purchase of Sewing Machines The general board members, in RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE visiting your stakes, report that a number of local societies do not have sewing machines. I can scarcely imagine a society of any considerable size being without a sewing machine. We, therefore, suggest that where it is at all feasible that the sisters work toward the purchase of at least one that will meet the ordinary requirements of the society. Ward Versus Stake Functions We note a growing tendency for stake boards to bring the wards together for functions that could more appropriately be conducted in the individual wards. As a_ general tule it is more convenient for the members, more women participate, fuller interest is felt, and greater benefits accrue to the sisters and to the society when functions are conducted in the individual wards. Support of Magazine We wish to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your loyal support of the Magazine. We urge stake Relief Society presidents to support the Magazine by calling it to the attention of stake and ward officers from time to time in the preliminary session of the union meeting. It is suggested that ward presidents allow five minutes once a month to call the Magazine to the attention of the members in a regular meeting of the society. Indian Relations Program I wish to again remind you that responsibility for the Indian relations program rests with the stake Indian relations committee, with the stake presidency at its head. Relief Society works in harmony with 809 this committee and has representation on it. Appoint as a member of the stake board a chairman of Indian relations as well as the committee members recommended in our recent letter to you when the need for such workers arises. Include in the annual narrative report a brief statement of the activity. We would also appreciate receiving a letter from you occasionally regarding the program. Handbook Available I am sure we are all happy that the Handbook is now available. With A Centenary of Relief Society also in your hands to acquaint you with the history of the society for its first hundred years, you have two valuable aids in the conduct of your work. Relief Society Building We again express Our most sincere thanks for your wonderful response to the Relief Society Building fund-raising program. We were hopeful, as was the First Presidency, that we could announce at this conference, the building site. We are assured by the First Presidency that they are moving as rapidly as they can in this situation. Just as soon as we receive definite word from them you will be advised. Lists of Contributors The lists of contributors were painstakingly and beautifully prepared. We thank you for the excellence of your work in this matter. Vase Received From the Swiss-Austrian Mission The general board recently received from the Swiss-Austrian Mission an exquisite Meissen ware vase 810 as a gift for the new Relief Society Building. It is very rare and beautiful. We all thank this mission for this choice gift which will have a prominent place in the new building where all of you may see it. Sisters, we love you for what you are and for the good you do. President Clark has told us: \"The Relief Society is the handmaid to the RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 Priesthood of God in carrying on his work for the salvation of men. This is the key to every task you undertake, it unlocks the door to your every duty, it opens the gate to all your activities.\" Let us always remember this admonition of President Clark. May God bless you in the important work to which you have been called, I sincerely pray.",

    "content": "Meeting Our Obligations Counselor Velma N. Simonsen OMETIME ago I read a letter written by a father to his son upon the son's_ graduation from college. In it he said, \"In the game of life it won't matter whether you win or lose, but how you meet your obligations.\" We can well apply that advice to our Own lives and to our work in the Church. It does not matter what positions we hold, whether we are presidents, counselors, secretaries, or visiting teachers, but how we meet the obligations of our positions. Probably we gathered here today have the greatest obligation of any group of women of equal numbers that could be called together anvwhere in the whole world. And to whom are we obligated? Certainly we have an obligation to the past. No other women have as great a heritage as we women of Relief Society, Think of that first Relief Society. The purpose and aims and fundamentals have not changed in over one hundred years. We must so build that we will not weaken the structure they so firmly established. We are obligated to the future. We are charged with the responsibility of training the mothers who in turn will take these instructions into the homes where they will influence future generations. But our greatest obligation is to the present, for this is our time, and, if we meet the obligation of today faithfully, we will likewise fulfill our obligation to the past and to the future. Of course, our first obligation is to God, for life and being and all that we have and are. That we are grateful for these blessings, that we are trying to fulfill our obligation to him, and that we are not satisfied with merely thanking him in words for his bounties to us, is evidenced by our 'accepting responsibility in his Church. But do we often ask ourselves as did one of old, \"What shall I render unto the Lord for all his goodness unto me?\" There is only one way we can really pay our debt to God —by keeping his commandments and rendering service to others. Someone has said, service is the rent we pay for the space we occupy here on earth. We are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE and as such we have an obligation to live the gospel and keep the commandments of God. At the time of baptism we made a covenant with the Lord to do so. But, as stake officers and teachers in Relief Society, it is especially important for us to live according to the standards of the Church and to set the proper example. We have been called to lead and direct the women of our stakes. We have been called to this position not because of our wealth, not because of our social positions, not because of any material possessions or qualifications we may have, but because we love the gospel and live it to the best of our ability and have quallities of spiritual leadership. And we can expect to lead the women no higher than we live ourselves. The Bible says, \"as with the people, so with the priest.\" Our homes must be examples for the women of the stakes to follow. They should be clean, well-kept, and sanitary. And it is our responsibility to guide, direct, and teach the women in the proper maintenance of their homes. There should be cooperation among family members, and love and righteous ambition. Tithing is accepted by Latter-day Saints as a law of God to man, and while the law contains a promise of rewards, we should obey it because it is the Lord's command that we do so, and by obedience comes the blessing of increased spirituality which we must have if we wish to meet the obligations of our callings. Important among the standards of the Church is the observance of the Word of Wisdom, the Lord's guide to temporal salvation, and the 811 proper care of the body. No true Latter-day Saint and, especially, no true Latter-day Saint chosen to a position of leadership, would disregard this law which condemns the use of tobacco and alcoholic beverages and advises against the use of tea and coffee. We need the great and unusual blessings that are promised to those who observe this law. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, and benevolent. We believe that, but do we practice it in very deed? In this day of idle words and scheming for self-gain are our promises fulfilled to the letter? Would we be willing to have the Church judged by the way we keep our obligations in this respect? THER helps toward gaining spiritual development are family and individual prayers and the blessings upon the food, the observance of the Sabbath day, which includes attendance at sacrament meeting and the partaking of the sacrament. Besides living the gospel and teaching it by example, we have an obligation to bring spirituality into all our Relief Society activities. We have a comprehensive educational program in Relief Society aimed to develop the women in every phase of life. We must not lose sight of the fact that spirituality is the foundation and the thread that must run through the entire structure of our Relief Society program to give it strength and purpose and effectiveness. We frequently hear it said, and rightly so, that through activity in Relief Society one can get a liberal 812 education, but we must not become so concerned with self-development in a material way that we lose sight of the great purpose of Relief Society—that of strengthening our testimonies of the gospel and of giving service to others. Years ago at a Relief Society conference, I heard a speaker make a statement that has helped me to realize the importance of spirituality in our lives. He said, \"Give your children spiritual experience and they will not be satisfied with any other.\" Let our women be fed rich spiritual food when they come to Relief Society and they will be anxious to return for more. As a child I used to go to the field with my father to feed the cows. 'They would be scattered all over the field. Father would pound on the bars with the pitchfork and the cows would come running from every direction. 'They were rewarded with good, fresh food. I wonder what would have happened RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 if once or twice they had not found good food when they were called. Upon you stake officers rests the responsibility to see that this spiritual food is given to the women in the wards. You must see that ways and means are found to let them enjoy spiritual experiences. Let us not let the temporal things of life take away the blessings of spirituality. 'The Lord has said: For behold I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty blessing. Wherefore be not weary in well doing for you are laying the foundation of a great work and out of small things proceedeth that which is great. Strive first for spirituality, seek first to know the deep things of God, and bring to our hungry mothers rich spiritual food. My prayer is that each of us holding a place of responsibility in Relief Society will so meet the obligations of her calling that when our final score is taken, it will be said of us, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant.\" Yoy in Leadership Counselor Marianne C. Sharp \"MEN are that they might have joy,\" so wrote the great prophet Nephi in declaring the summation of man's goal. Joy, however, comes as a reward for obedience to.

    "content": "Joy in leadership, as in other activities, comes as a result of exercising leadership in the way marked out for us by the greatest leader, as he was the greatest teacher, our Savior Jesus Christ. In speaking of leadership, Christ taught:. Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. Therefore, you sisters who stand at the head of the Relief Societies of the stakes of the Church and all assembled here today are servants to those over whom we preside. In order to render the utmost in service there are certain attributes which must be woven into the very being of our spirits. RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE Perhaps the frst desirable at tribute would be a full-hearted acceptance of the particular call which Howevet unworthy we may feel to a call of Jeadership in the Church, we know that we are called to such positions through the inspiration of the Priesthood.

A second necessary attribute for joy im leadership ls full loyalty to those who preside over recognition of their right to 813 us. Perhaps we may be given more duties and responsibilities than we consider to be just. Will we ever find joy through rebelling or being disloyal and complaining to others? No, and through perfect loyalty in accepting without question all that '5 asked of each of us, comes greatest srowth. Every task which is undertaken with a willing spirit to which we devote our best efforts rewards the doer with increased powet of accomplishment. The more the ef fort required, the greater the growth. As Sister Robison 'ised to say, \"Wel come the task that makes you g° beyond yourself.\" Another essential attribute closely aligned with the full acceptance of a call and the magnifying of it and loyalty to those who preside over US, ', not to aspire to any other posi tion than the one to which we have been called. At many of the early meetings of Relief i Prophet Joseph Smith warned the sisters repeatedly against this very evil. Said, \"Everyone should aspire only to magnify his own office and calling, beware of self-righteousness and be limited in the estimate of your own virtues.\" From filling the positions to which we are called will come growth to of each of our spirits which the Lord knows needs the greatest development.

SESSION THURSDAY AFTERNOON, SEPTEMBER 29, 1949 Digest— Choose You Shis Day Evon W. Peterson HE hosts of heaven were assembled in that great council to listen to the voice of the Father as he told them of his plan to create an earth where his children could enter into their second estate, which was to take a body and fulfill the full measure of their creation. At that time the Father bestowed upon them the greatest of all gifts, the right to choose—to choose that day whom they would follow. In that assembly, naturally, there were some who were not as valiant as were others, yet they were all given their free agency to choose for themselves. That free agency has continued in mortality as a basic principle in the eternal law of progression. However, if we are to gain eternal life, we must be obedient to the laws of truth. Often in the midst of sorrow or trials that come into our lives or disasters that come upon the world, we ask, \"Why does God allow it?\" One writer said: If only we were honest with ourselves we would admit how unfair it is to blame the Lord. The simple truth is that mankind, not the Lord, is entirely responsible. These things are the direct result of abusing the most wonderful gift we have ever received from heaven—the gift of free-will. In the Book of Mormon we read where the Prophet Samuel was preaching to the Lamanites and he told them of the things that were to happen and the great blessings that were in store for those who would heed the teachings of the Lord, and then he pointed out the tribulations that would come to those who would not believe and he said: And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself and who doeth iniquity doeth it unto himself, for behold ye are free, ye are permitted to act for yourself, for behold God has given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free. In our complex life today we are continually meeting new problems. Almost every day is a day of decisions—what to do, what choice to make. With our limited understanding we cannot make important decisions without guidance. There has never been a time when man needed more desperately the help of divine inspiration than he does today, and I know of no better way to secure this inspiration than by keeping the commandments of our Father in Heaven. Although the world is ever changing, the fundamental truths of our gospel are the same today as they the multitudes on the shores of Galilee. He marked the path and led the way, and as Latter-day Saints we have been given light and under. Standing of the road which leads to eternal life. Are we as parents heeding that counsel? Are we exercising our gift of choice in such a way that it will] assure the greatest happiness for ourselves and for our families? I recently read an article written by Elder Stephen L Richards in which he said: The homes which Produce real Latter. Day Saints shall be presided over and maintained by men of strength and cour. Age, of virtue and vision, and by women of tendemess, unselfishness and infinite patience and love. One of our responsibilities as parents is to help our children in mak. Ing important decisions in life. We May not be able to help a child solve his particular Problem, but we can help him to acquire the right attitude toward it and we can encourage him to go to his Heavenly Father for assistance, Youth is the seedtime of life, and if a child is to Teap an abundant harvest he must be taught to choose and sow those seeds that will develop a righteous life. We cannot compel a child to appreciate love and beauty. This appreciation only comes through association with the Home atmosphere js likely the most basic consideration in the development of youth. If the atmos. Phere is healthy and stimulating, the lives of family members who breathe it will likewise be healthy and vigorous, Our Relief Society lessons have taught us that too many today are content to remain on the fringe of righteousness, satisfied with the shel] When they could and should have the core. The worthwhile things of life lie ahead and only struggle can bring us to them. Those who are willing to exert the greater effort reach the greater heights. A man was traveling along a paved highway. The Pavement ended and there stretched before him as far as he could see a ditt road in very poor condition. Where the poor road began a large sign read \"Choose your tut now for you will be in it for the next twenty miles,\" There are Many spiritual ruts along life's highway. Let us try to avoid them. The road to tighteousN€ss is upward and ahead. There are easier roads to travel, but there are none that will bring the supreme joy that comes from righteous liying. The degree of happiness that we may enjoy during our later years will not come by accident nor by good luck, as some may say, but it will be the result of the way we live each day. Let us also remember it is likely that we teach more by what we do RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE spiration of our Father in Heaven in guiding our children so that they may choose for themselves the better life. And in the words of Joshua 817 of old, let us say",

    "content": "\"Choose you this day whom ye will serve, but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\" Digest— Cultivating Life s Gternal Values Mary J. Wilson S a text for my brief message I have taken a verse from the sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants: Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich. The most important responsibility resting upon any individual is to build a worthwhile and meaningful life. 'This objective is not achieved in a day, a week, or a year. With every person is born the God-given assignment to build a life. What, then, are the materials we should use in building a worthwhile and meaningful life? America's great inspirational poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, caught the vision: For the structure that we raise Time is with materials filled, Our todays and yesterdays Are the blocks with which we build. Nothing enduring can be built without a pattern or plan. We must have purpose and direction in our building. What is the great plan by which we shape our lives? We, as Relief Society sisters, know the answer, for it is to know and to do the will of our Heavenly Father. Our time, our energy, and our means are limited, so we are of necessity confronted with the responsibility of making choices. How necessary it is, therefore, that we develop a pattern of life containing imperishable, eternal values, and that we build them into the structure of our individual lives. May I suggest some of the basic soul values which must go into the great edifice of eternal life? Some of the eternal qualities for which we must strive are sincere and abiding faith, interest in and love for our fellow men, and sincere devotion to our Heavenly Father's plan for the achievement of eternal life. Faith is that which gives us vision to carry on, and confidence in ultimate success, even in the face of present discouragement. In I Nephi, 17th chapter, we learn that Nephi was commanded to build a ship. His brothers laughed at him and ridiculed him, but Nephi said unto them: If God had commanded me to. Do all things I could do them. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done. Through faith we have the power to be selective. We may know the wheat from the chaff. There is no more important element in building faith and cultivating the other qualities of eternal life than prayer. It is a means of getting closer to God; through this medium we learn his will. Yet too often our prayers are uttered as a matter of habit and routine. But the prayers that will enrich our souls 818 and give us new vision and faith are the prayers through which we open our souls completely to God with the faith and confidence that he will give us strength to face and overcome the things that are keeping us from achieving true spiritual growth. Faith and prayer, however, cannot function in our lives in a truly effective way merely as abstract principles. In James, we are told that \"faith without works is dead.\" We must therefore reflect our faith in our service and love for our fellow men. One of the greatest statements in the Bible concerning the Savior is, he \"went about doing good.\" When service is mentioned, we are prone to cast about for an opportunity to serve in a big way in a remote place. Our tendency is to forget the \"Acres of Diamonds\" lying about our own doors. In the same community, or on the same block, or perhaps in our own families, there are those who are discouraged and impoverished for the want of words of hope and love. There are those who are spiritually sick as well as mentally and physically ill. On the whole, our fields of service lie within areas about our own homes. A Relief Society visiting teacher, on one of her visits, found a sister crushed with grief. 'This afflicted sister had passed through much sorrow, and she had lost faith in her Heavenly Father. 'The visiting teacher had a newly found interest in this unfortunate sister. 'The teacher visited her new friend often, and helped her to get new interests in life; helped her to reRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 kindle faith in herself and faith in immortality. 'This is only one example of true love and service that comes from our visiting teachers, but there are thousands of such cases where people have helped within our Relief Society organization. Latter-day Saints have a marvelous concept of the meaning and necessity of growth through acquisition of knowledge. The Lord has declared that the \"glory of God is intelligence,\" and that \"man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge.\" Then again in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 130:18-19, we read, \"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.\" How can we, then, cultivate knowledge and intelligence in our quest for eternal values? First, we must be awakened to the need for growth, and then we shall find the means and opportunities for development. We not only gain knowledge through the study of great books, but through prayer we also find the ways and means of development. Let us not waste time. Benjamin Franklin wrote, \"Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is what life is made of.\" One often hears this expression, \"If I just had time to do this or that,\" but we overlook what can be accomplished by small snatches of time. Be ever alert to your opportunities. Study, seek good companions, insist upon filling your life with eternal riches. RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE You have a great birthright, you live in a land \"choice above all other lands.\" You have accepted as a pattern of life the gospel of Jesus Christ. Your opportunities are unbounded. But only you can fashion your individual lives into glorious, 819 eternal mansions filled with the eternal light of truth. May God bless all of us that we may get the vision necessary to see life at its best and give us strength to live according to an eternal pattern. Digest—Prepare Shy Heart Leone O. Jacobs NE of the most glorious truths of life is that we can always rise above our present level. Wouldn't life be discouraging if, once we found ourselves involved in unworthy conduct, we couldn't pull ourselves up, and out, and on to better ways? But we don't have to remain as we are. Each day offers a new beginning. | An old man was once reviewing his life to a friend: \"When I was thirty I was just no good—no good to anybody, not even to myself. Then one day I had the urge, the desire, to right about face. I decided I was going to change my direction, and from that moment I have led a life I'm proud of.\" A young college girl paused one day in her round of excitement and said, \"I guess I'm going with the wrong crowd. I don't think I want to go where they're going.\" She didn't go that way. A mother of three husky little boys had never deemed it necessary to give them any religious instruction. Oh, yes, she fed them wellbalanced meals, kept them as clean as little boys can be kept, and saw to it that bedtime was strictly observed. But one day she pondered to herself, \"I wonder if I'm a really good mother. I guess there's more to rearing a family than merely feeding and clothing them. I seem to have time for my bridge club and for social engagements in the evenings, but maybe I'm neglecting some important points.\" She did something about it. Lives can be changed, can't they? The course of our lives can be rerouted. But how? Let's call it preparing the heart. Well, what does preparing one's heart mean? It means checking up on one's self, scrutinizing one's daily life and evaluating what is there—what is worthy and what is unworthy of continuing. It means ridding one's self of bitterness and selfishness. It means humbling one's self before the Lord. It means complete forgiveness of all wrongs inflicted on us, either real or imagined. It means opening wide one's heart to righteousness—putting one's self in an attitude to receive good. It means planning one's course differently. Picture in your mind a field, plowed and harrowed from end to end, leveled perfectly, weeds burned down along the fence line, everything possible done that is conducive to the growth of good seed. The field is ready, waiting to receive that good seed. We can put our hearts in that very same condition, in an 820 attitude of receptiveness to good. We can plow up the old, useless habits and smooth down the rough places of error. We hear someone say, \"I wish I could enjoy working in the Church as you do. It seems to make you so happy.\" They can. It's all in the set of the heart. It's all in preparing the heart to want that sort of living. And then we hear people say, too, \"But I don't see how you get time for it all.\" In one of our recent Relief Society conventions, a bishop said something profoundly impotrtant for us to remember. He said, \"If you're too busy to serve the Lord, you're too busy.\" Yes, if we are too busy to serve the Lord, then we are too busy doing other things that aren't so worthwhile. In the Old Testament we read this: \"For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it.\" What a lovely ideal for us to follow. And in the Doctrine and Covenants (132:3) the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith: - \"Therefore,",

Carrying out one's plans and good intentions, of course, is important, too, but the action is comparatively easy once the heart is thoroughly prepared for that course. As the poem says, \"It's the set of the soul that determines the goal.\" So far as living the gospel is concerned, I firmly believe we can do the things we want to do, if the desire is strong enough. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 In our Relief Society organization we have much help in preparing our hearts to do good. Our wonderful lessons and work meeting activities give us great help. But we not only have help in preparing our own hearts, but we have the opportunity to help others in preparing their hearts. Visiting teaching gives us a fine opportunity of turning the hearts of inactive Church members, little by little, back to activity. It ls within our power to show the joy of service and the beauties of the gospel to those who are engrossed in worldly affairs. A bishop recently made a special plea that Relief Society members put their arms around our sisters who have drifted away and estranged themselves from the Church because they have married outsiders. Through sheer love and personal interest, we should endeavor to draw them to our organization and thus to activity in the gospel. Living the gospel means sharing it with as many others as possible, doesn't it? And visiting teaching ls indeed a challenge in sharing the gospel. 'True, every home cannot be approached in the same manner, and this is why visiting teaching requires such thought, such preparation, tact, and prayer. Remember, if you are too busy to serve the Lord, you are too busy. Prepare your hearts to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and in every way possible help others to prepare their hearts for nighteousness.

    "content": "Ready for Christmas Ora Pate Stewart T was three days before Christmas, but Emmy was ready. Always, the day after Christmas, she could be seen crocheting a fine edge on a white handkerchief, pulling threads on a scarf for a bit of Swedish darning, or sewing small cross stitches into a sampler or cushion—so that she'd be ready by the next Christmas. \"It's not like I make a burden of it,\" she would explain, and her sharp dark eyes would sparkle with spirit. \"I may not be so young, but I still enjoy the giving end,\" she would continue. And sometimes she would add, \"There are richer folks, but giving has never been a burden to me.\" It was true. She was old, if you looked in the family Bible and counted up her eighty-six years. And she could have been considered poor, if you insisted that old coal stoves and worn linoleum floors were the badges of that modest economy. But she gave, and the burden was never evident. She didn't give just to the needy. I'm sure I didn't need the towel she gave me one year with crocheted colored flowers spilling out from a crocheted basket. And yet, every time I come across that towel, now faded and frayed, something pleasant rises up within me like the scent of old spice. It puts the world in better tune, and points up the corners of my spirits. I needed that, and I guess she knew it. Notwithstanding her years and the circle of braided white hair that framed her slender face, she was Emmy to everyone. Tots were coached to address her as Grandma Emmy, and youthful friends sometimes referred to her as Aunt Emmy. But Emmy she was, and only the postman and the tax collector shared any dim remembrance of a surname. With her lived her widowed daughter, who had made room for her son and his wife, whose three children had been born there. And _ hers was the only house I have ever seen homing four generations in_harmony. Emmy was not wholly crippled. Her hands were gnarled with arthritis, and there were indications that other junctions of her anatomy were similarly afflicted. But she had maintained a discipline over tightening joints, and the pattern of her artistic soul was still transmitted straight and true through her crooked fingers. Years before a stroke had invaded one side of her face, clasping one corner of her mouth in a perpetual smile. \"T'm so thankful I wasn't frowning when it hit,\" she would explain. \"Whenever my mother used to catch me pouting she would say, 'Now, Emmy, what if your face should freeze that way? Wouldn't you be a pretty sight!' So now I have to keep a smile on the other side to keep my mouth from looking like a pretzel.\" From then on I watched her to see if she ever frowned so that I could see her pretzel mouth. But the smile held on. \"Besides,\" she would continue, Page 821 822 \"suppose the old striker should come back for the other side? They say if he comes once he will come again. I'll have to be ready.\" I should have recognized the ominousness of that possibility; but the way Emmy put it there was nothing ominous. And we all smiled with her. S° the morning her great-granddaughter came for me and said Grandma Emmy wanted me to come and get my Christmas present I was somewhat astonished. \"Tt's three days before Christmas,\" I protested, \"and besides, I haven't got Emmy's present finished yet.\" I was making her a scrapbook of poems and proverbs that I thought she might like. I used to read to her sometimes and felt we had a secret bond that the others didn't share. \"She didn't say to bring her present,\" the child rejoiced, \"she said for you to come and get yours.\" I gathered up the unfinished scrapbook and went to get my coat. \"She said for you to bring your ukulele, too,\" the child continued. \"She wants some Christmas carols.\" Often I had played the ukulele for Emmy, sometimes as an instrumental solo, and sometimes as accompaniment for folk songs or hymns. We used to work out harmonies on \"My Old Kentucky Home\" and \"The Old Rugged Cross.\" She especially liked my arrangement of \"Moonlight and Roses\" and \"Abide With Me.\" She never belittled the sincerity of that small music box. She never even said, \"\"T'oo bad you never had RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1949 a pipe organ,\" like so many of my friends always said. I got the ukulele and followed the child to Emmy's house. Emmy was sitting on the edge of her bed. Besides the four generations of her household there were the milkman and the iceman, who had finished the",
