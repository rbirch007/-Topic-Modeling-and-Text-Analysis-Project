Willard Luce HILLTOP ASPENS 

THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 36, NO. 3 MARCH 1949 J Have Seen Aspens Alice Morrey Bailey I have seen them brave the winds of March, Lashed to the bouldered hill with rooted twine, Or form a staunch but trembling, green-laced arch To shield their foster nurslings, seedling pine. And I have seen them gray along the banks Of autumn creek-beds when the year was old, With withered veins and death among their ranks, Standing stark above their useless gold. Today I saw the aspens, slim and still As maidens, unaware of life, and nude, Where winter edges spring upon the hill In this brief interval of pristine mood. And soon their black-eyed boles, with pearly sheen, Will glow through misted veils of tender green. The Cover: "Pinnacles," Photograph by Willard Luce.
