he oven and, in spite of her agitation, gently removed a cake, leaving the oven door open. "Again! After three summers of it. Going from house to house, enlisting students, and then checking up on the ones who don't show up for practice, getting dates for programs, worrying about uniforms, worrying about funds. Well, I'm not doing it again. For once, I'll be firm with him. I'll say, Now that my older children are out of school, and I have no one taking lessons, I find that my interests are along other lines—something like that, Ill say. Doesn't that practicing bother you, Pa?" Mr. Finley had momentarily emerged from his newspaper, and was placing his shoes on the oven door. "What—oh, you mean that Peterson kid? No, never even notice it. Ought to be used to it by this time. So ought you, Clara. Your own kids practiced enough. Jerry on his sax, Ida with her violin, and Ruthie on the piano. Seemed hke Ruthie made the most noise." Mr. Finley was a mild little man, a steady worker, a good provider, who had long since left the details of the family's education to his wife. "That was because Ruthie had to practice in the living room all the time." Mrs. Finley sighed, and went on clearing the table. "Yes, but our children had some talent for music, if I do say so. I remember the last time Ida played in Professor Ernesto's recital, every note in perfect tune, and such beautiful expression! Ruthie accompanied her at the piano! It was lovely, and you'd never have guessed how they'd fought while they were practicing together." Mrs. Finley wiped her eyes furtively on an apron corner. "But, as I've said before, you go through all that, and what happens? The girls get married, and Jerry goes away to medical school, and leaves his sax in the basement. So—my nerves the way they've been lately, I'm just as glad that Carl shows no talent whatever. All he's interested in is rabbits, or pigeons, and _ baseball." Page 513 514 She was speaking of their youngest, 1 student at Eastlake Junior High. Mr. Finley had finished reading the editorial page, and was hurrying to finish his pie. His only response to his wife's remarks was an indistinct Mumble. RS. Finley finished clearing up, eating a small wedge of pie as she did so, taking bites over the sink. She was small, and neat, and plump, and every movement was precise and bustling, as she moved about the kitchen with short, quick steps. She was telling herself, of course, if Carl had any talent, why, naturally she'd let him take lessons on something. Even though she had gone through years and years of all of them practicing at once, in different rooms, of course, and Pa usually having the radio on good and loud in the kitchen. It had been worth it, worth counting out Jerry's music while he played his sax, until sometimes she could hear "Qne-and-two-and-three-and" in her dreams. It had been worth sitting at the piano playing accompaniments for Ida's violin pieces over and over for her, at the same time keeping an eye on what was on the stove for dinner. It had been worthwhile even with Ruthie's habit of starting to practice at just the right time so she couldn't help get supper on. She had been proud of them, too. Every one had become a good player. But now—well, it was a relief to have a little peace and quiet. That is, it had been until Arnie Peterson, next door, started taking lessons on the sax. Mr. Finley suddenly folded his RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 paper, put on his warm shoes and picked up his lunch bucket. "Did Carl ever get measured for his new suit?" "No, he didn't. And that's. Another thing," replied Mrs. Finley. "T ordered it two. Weeks ago, and every afternoon after school I've tried to get him to go down to the tailors and get measured. But he always has some excuse, and the next thing I know, he's over to Petersons with Arnie." "Maybe he's spent some of his money. A kid that age, who works as hard as Carl does delivering pa pers every morning—well, you couldnt blame him if he spent some of it. Maybe you'd better give him some money, Clara." "No! I want him to learn the value of money. If he uses his own, it'll mean more to him, and maybe he will take better care of his clothes.". She leaned over for Mr. Finley's dutiful kiss on her cheek as he left for work; but she was preoccupied. She had to hurry to frost the cake, because she had to attend a ParentTeacher officers meeting at four o'clock. Just before she left the house, she dialed Mrs. Peterson's number. "Ts Carl over at your house, Mrs. Peterson? Oh, yes, I thought I could hear Arnie practicing—my goodness, he certainly does work at it, doesn't he? I was going to ask you if you'd send Carl home now. I'm going out, and I want him to— Oh, all right!" Mrs. Finley's cheeks were several shades pinker as she hung up the phone. She was sure she had heard Mrs. Peterson say, "Gladly!"—in an undertone. 7 MUSIC IN THE HOME The two roses on the front of Mrs. Finley's hat bobbed energetically as she hurried toward the high school. Sometimes, she wished that she was a man, with nothing to do but go to work every day, year in and year out. It had been very annoying when Professor Ernesto phoned _ that morning, especially considering his earlier message about the band committee. It seemed that one of the musical numbers for the P. T. A, meeting the very next evening had disappointed him at the last minute. "I'm so very, very busy," he sighed into the phone, "and you, Mrs. F inley, you have had so much experience with music. And with young people, such an under. Standing! Ah, music in the home! All of them participating! Ah, how wonderful!" By the time he had stated the reason for his call, the halting strains of "Swanee River," slightly off key, drifted in through the open window. So Mrs. Finley suggested that Arnie play a solo. The professor was dubious, but Mrs. Finley said that the. Students should 'have first chance, shouldn't they? Besides, she had no time to run all over town to as PTA a "She did not: return home until nearly dusk, but that didn't matter, for when: Mr. Finley was on after. Noon shift, she just fixed a snack supper for herself and Carl. As she walked up the path, she saw that the tabbits were loose again, eating off the tulips. The phone was ringing. The house was unlighted, and she stumbled: over Carl's: bat and ball 515 as she hurried through the entrance hall toward the phone. "Hello—oh, it's you, Mrs. Peterson." Her tones became more formal, remembering their conversation of the afternoon. "That will be nice, for Arnie to play tomorrow night. Oh, that's too bad yes, you may, if I can find it." She limped toward the bedroom, changed her dress, and came back to call from the kitchen window, "Carl! Car-ul!'" Presently, he ambled in through the back door. "Carl, did you find my note about going to the tailor's? And the rabbits are out again. Now, I know how fond you are of them, but this can't continue. The neighbors will complain." CARL leaned against the door. "Don't know how they get out all the time. Somebody must let em." His smooth brow, unmarred by the freckles which covered the lower part of his face, puckered with annoyance. - "Carl, did you go to the tailor's?" "Well, no, Mother. Not today. I didn't have time." "Time! My goodness! Why didn't you go there, instead of staying at Peterson's so long? And that's another thing. I think it's getting on her nerves for you to be there so much. Maybe you bother Arie when he's practicing. In the future, F-don't want you to go over there oftener than twice a weck." Carl's entire face wrinkled in protest. "Twice a week! Gosh, Mother, I've gotta." hs "No, you haven't. Now let's get this other business decided. Tomorrow, Pll go with you, right after 516 school, and we'll get your suit measured, so it will be sure to be finished in time for the school's closing exercises in May." "Look, Mother, why don't I get a ready-made suit? It'll be cheaper, and no bother." "T explained it to you before." Mrs. Finley's voice bore an edge of patience. "I want you to have a tailored one, because this man knows how to make it so it can be let out in the fall, in case you grow. Which of course you will. And it will look better." But he had already slipped out the door, muttering about the rabbits. Mts. Finley sighed. She moved the soup to the back of the stove, and went down into the basement. Sometimes, it was hard to get a boy that age to do things when you wanted him to. Mrs. Finley was quite sure she had put Jerry's sax in the small enclosure back of the water pipes, where she had put her empty fruit jars. Although the basement was tight, Mrs. Finley always suspected such corners of harboring mice. She screamed at the sudden rustling back of her. '"When'll supper be ready?" "Scare a person to death! It's ready now. Carl, have you seen anything of Jerry's sax? Mrs. Peterson wants to borrow the reed, because Arnie has broken his, and has to play tomorrow night. I can't imagine where it could be, unless someone has borrowed it in my absence." She brushed the dust from her apron. Carl started suddenly toward the stairs. "Why would I know where it is? Anyhow, Arnie was practicing all tight this afternoon." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 He went so quickly to the bathroom to wash that his mother wondered fleetingly if he had been up to something. Well, she would just have to call Mrs. Peterson and explain. Surely Professor Ernesto would have an extra reed around. N the following afternoon, Carl disappeared for several hours, and didn't come home until supper time. But Mrs. Finley was so busy getting her husband off to work, pressing her dress, and finishing her notes for the little speech she had to make that night, that she decided she wouldn't have time to go to the tailor's, anyway. It could wait one more day. On the other hand, Carl might have gone by himself, although it seemed unlikely. That evening, she called for Mrs. Peterson. Mr. Peterson, it seemed, had a committee meeting of some sort. Usually a calm, reserved woman, Mrs. Peterson's sallow face was tense with a strange irritability. She was tall and angular, and her long legs took such strides that Mrs. Finley, puffing along beside her, kept explaining that they had plenty of time. "It was good of you to let Amie play his solo on such short notice," she began breathlessly, by way ot pouring oil on troubled waters. "Oh, Arnie isn't playing a solo," Mrs. Peterson flung back over her shoulder. '"He's to play a duet, with another boy. And this other boy didn't show up to practice this afternoon. So I don't know." "Don't worry about it," panted Mrs. Finley, kindly, "Arnie will be sure to know his part. He practices so faithfully." "Well, part of the time it's this MUSIC IN THE HOME other kid there practicing. Sometimes, I think I'll go crazy. Neither of them can play worth anything." Mrs. Peterson spoke bitterly, her pace increasing with her annoyance. Mrs. Finley said, "I know just how you feel. I never did think a saxophone was human. You'd think this other boy would practice in his own home, though. Not bother you." Mrs. Peterson strode along for a moment of silence. "You would think so, wouldn't you?" she replied presently. A little breeze had come up. Between keeping her hair tucked under her hat at the side, and keeping up with Mrs. Peterson, Mrs. Finley had no breath for conversation until they were comfortably seated in the auditorlum. 'Then Mrs. Finley made cheerful remarks about things in general. But Mrs. Peterson kept her lip in a thin line, and had little to say. The only trouble about sitting by Mrs. Peterson was that she kept nudging you whenever something happened, and her elbow was so bony. Suddenly, she nudged Mrs. Finley. "There comes Professor Ernesto. Don't let on that I said those kids didn't practice this afternoon. I only wish I could help them, it sounds so. Oh, good evening, Professor." Mrs. Finley thought that the professors thin shoulders, under his pepper-and-salt suit, were even more hunched and tired than usual. But he wore an affable smile. "So glad Arnie could play tonight, Mrs. Peterson. It will give the boy such valuable experience. And he's improving! Yes he's improving. And you, Mrs. Finley, you have such 517 a talented family. Do you think Carl has the musical ability of your other children? Sometimes I think the boys enjoy all that blowing, even if it doesn't seem to make music. It sort of relieves their feelings." "Why, yes, I suppose so," said Mrs. Finley, looking a little annoyed. "Of course, Carl isn't much interested in it. He likes " She fell silent under Mrs. Peterson's prodding, as the professor moved away. HE musical part of the program was ready to begin. The business meeting would come later, so that the students could go home. Mrs. Finley began quietly sorting the cards on which her notes were written, so that she would not lose her place in the speech she had to give later. On. She was only half listening to the program, although she applauded each number enthusiastically. As the last number was announced, there was a little commotion at the back of the stage. She looked up absently. Mrs. Peterson dug mercilessly into her side. Then the room seemed to swim before her eyes. 'There on the platform, ready to play, were Arnie Peterson and this other boy. And this other boy was Carl, clad in his school cords and a polo shirt, and even now raising Jertrys sax to his lips and puffing out his cheeks. The professor, at the piano, played the opening measures and smiled encouragement. The halting strains of "Swanee River," slightly off key, floated out over the restless audience. "Oh, dear, to think he didn't even 518 get cleaned up," thought Mrs. Finley, irrelevantly. During the little spatter of applause, Mrs. Peterson muttered into her ear, "I guess he had them last, sO people would not be listening too closely. I should have told you, I guess, but I figured it was up to Carl. He said he wanted to surprise you. That's why I sent over to borrow the reed. I knew he had your other boy's sax, and J thought maybe you'd catch on." "Me and my peace and quiet," thought poor Mrs. Finley. Somehow, she made her way to the front of the room. She said to Carl, who was putting the sax into its case, "But, Carl, that was lovely. Why didn't you tell me?" Carl looked up, a wide grin splitting his freckles. "Gee, Mother, you mean, you liked it? I just wanted to Surprise you. Were you surprised?" Mrs. Finley leaned against the Piano. "Yes, very." Professor Ernesto hurried up. "Oh, you mean you didn't know Carl was to play tonight? Just like a boy, wanting to surprise his motha." } Mrs. Finley said to Carl, "Did you rise some of your money for lessons? Is that why you didn't order your suit? Why in the world?. Well, Pll give you some money, tomor-? TOW. "Don't worry, Mother. Pll have the money. I sold my rabbits. Pigcons are less bother, anyway." Her throat constricted at the sactifice. "Oh, Car] you shouldn't have. You were so fond of them. Who bought them?" Carl's placid face bore no signs of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—AUGUST 1949 cmotion as he shifted his g the other side of his mouth. Butcher," he said. He took up his case, and turned to look for Arnie. ° Mrs. Finley felt weak. She said to | the professor, after a moment, "Pro- " fessor, you make me feel ashamed. When I think of all the practicing you have listened to—I, well, I don't know what to say, only that I want Carl to keep on taking lessons. He needs all the help he can get,". The professor beamed at her and went on with his work of putting away the music. She stood there a moment, She looked at his thinning gray hair, and at the long, sensitive fingers sorting the music. Al] at once, she realized who had made the countless wrinkles at the corner of his eyes, had given his mouth that patient set. It was her children, and dozens of others just like them. They had taken their toll of the promise of his youth. It was their lack of consideration, the jangle of wrong notes they played, the sharps and flats falling willynilly from hapless fingers, As she neared the platform, Carl came back, followed by Amie. Carl was grinning. "Now we can practice at our place. The Professor says you're gonna be head of the band committee again. Can I havea uniform? Arnie's mother can't play, sO you can play for us every afterNOON. Jee," al Mrs. Finley nodded mutely;: As the boys walked on out of theauditorium, she prepared to face her audience, but Professor Ernesto's words kept ringing in her ears, "Ah, music in the home." Unconsciously, she straightened her shoulders, bracing herself. Rugmaking in the New _ England Mission President S. Dilworth Young Member, First Council of Seventy President, New England Mission AVE you ever hooked a rug? Don't sniff! Rug hooking is not 'the lost art of the pioneers—a makeshift, used only until the railroads could arrive with the cheaper woven articles. It is something else. It is an art that every woman can easily learn, in which she can express her artistic inhibitions, use up old scraps—of no. Use for anything else, create articles of varied use for the home, and sell. The products of her skill for sums of money to. Purchase personal fin- 'ery, or a new suit for little Jimmy. --A group of women working in a Relief Society will always have several souls of the right temperament to turn out articles for the annual bazaar which will be one of the most profitable sources of income imaginable. ~ There are hooked rags, and then. There are hooked rugs. Sometime ago, Sister Young and I stopped at a fisherman's cottage on the south shore of Nova Scotia. Mrs. Murphy lives there, and could hook rugs, we 'were told. So we went in. Mrs. Murphy was a delightful lady of Scotch descent with the "burr" still in her inflection. She showed us _the rugs she was making, the homemade frame on which was stretched the burlap back which formed the base of the rug, and a finished rug, which looked "right nice." Would she sell the rug? No, this was not tapestry.
