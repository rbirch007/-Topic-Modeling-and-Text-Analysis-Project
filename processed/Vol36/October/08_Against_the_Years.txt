In these words is found the keynote which characterized the administration of President Grant during neatly three decades—absolute obedience to the word and will of God. Heber J. Grant, who was the seventh President of the Church, was the first President to be born in Utah and to grow up in the pioneering age of the colonization of the saints in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains. He was bom in Salt Lake City on November 22, 1856, a son of Jedediah M. Grant, a member of the First Presidency, and Rachel Ridgway Ivins. His mother had accepted the restored gospel in New Jersey and, turning her back on the worldly wealth and a life of ease that her family offeied, cast her lot with the Latter-day Saints and moved to the West. Nine days following the birth of Heber, who was her first child, her husband died. She was a woman of strong character and independence of spirit. In order to be self-supporting, she became a seamstress and also maintained a boarding house, thus making a living for herself and child. The boyhood of President Grant was spent in Salt Lake City, Utah. In later life he often recalled his mother's struggles against poverty and adversity during his childhood, feeling that his character had been enriched and strengthened through these hardships. When he was about thirteen years of age, the youthful RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 Heber became deeply impressed by the story of Nephi as recorded in the Book of Mormon. He often referred to the impression that the following declaration of Nephi made upon him: And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them (I Nephi 3:7). The great accomplishments which this ancient prophet-leader achieved through obedience to the commandments of the Lord and the admonitions of his father, inspired the boy Heber to emulate him. He determined to make implicit obedience to the Lord's injunctions and his mother's teachings the guideposts of his life. He became a dutiful and obedient son and at an early age was actively engaged in Church service. But obedience meant more to him than merely doing what was advised or requested. He conceived obedience to be intimately connected with improvement or perfection. This led him to strive for improvement in whatever he was assigned to do, or in anything that he undertook to do. At an early stage in life he commenced to manifest the invincible determination that characterized his thought and conduct to the end of his life. His own narratives reveal the struggles through which he passed in learning to play baseball, to write legibly, to sing, to become a public speaker, and to overcome the handicap of a weak physique. LESSON DEPARTMENT As President Grant often quoted and proved to be true by his own persistence, "That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased." At an early age Heber J. Grant embarked upon a career of busithat has placed him in the front ranks of state-builders in the Intermountain West. From a messenger for an insurance firm he rose to Positions of bookkeeper, then bank cashier, and later established his own insurance company, The training he gained in these ventures was later to be of inestimable worth to the Church. When the Church was _ staggering under a great burden of debt, intensitied by nation-wide depression, he was sent by the First Presidency on financial missions to the east and west coasts to borrow large sums of money for the benefit of the Church and its membership. The beet sugar industry in the Intermountain terhis enterprise, So prominent had he become in the public mind, that it appears certain he would have been nominated as a candidate for the position of first governor of the State of Utah by one of the political parties. He confesses that nothing would have pleased him more at the time than to have had this honor, but when he asked President Woodruff if he should accept it, no reply was forthcoming. Heber J. Grant then realized that the Church needed him more than the State did and, subordinating his own desires to his determination to obey his calling as one of the Twelve, he asked that 715 his name be withheld from the convention.. Farlier, in October 1880, when not quite twenty-four years of age, he was called by President Taylor to take up his residence in Tooele and preside over that stake. Acceptance of this call meant a great financial sacrifice to the young business man but, true to the precept that guided him in his life, he devoted himself to the task with admirable success. Two years later he was called to the apostleship. He opened and presided over the mission of the Church in Japan from 1901 to 1903, and later presided over the European Mission from 1904 to 1906. These mission experiences occurred in days when the Church was maligned and persecuted on all sides. President Grant lived to be received with Ovations from the press of the countries that once abused him and the Church he Tepresented as a missionary. The last words that the late President Joseph F. Smith spoke on the day of the night he died, to Heber J. Grant were: The Lord bless you, my boy, the Lord bless you; you have got a great Tesponsibility. Always remember this is the Lord's work, and not man's, The Lord is greater than any man. He knows whom he wants to lead His Church, and never makes any mistake. The Lord bless you (Gospel Standards, page 194). Throughout the years that he directed the destinies of the Church as the Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, he endeavored to make this admonition his guide. The policies of his predecessor were continued. The Church continued its expansion in missionary work with the opening of new missions and the erection or LESSON DEPARTMENT Some have argued that the word of wisdom was "To be sent greeting; not by commandment or restraint " To such, President Grant said, "But what else does it say? It says ' by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth ' What? 'Showing forth the order and will of God." That was sufficient for President Grant, and should be for every one who calls himself a member of the Church. The will of God should be obeyed as much as a direct commandment, if one properly understands the gospel. Another notable accomplishment of the Church under the inspired leadership of President Grant, was the institution of the Church Welfare Plan on a Church-wide basis. Based upon revelation as definite as any received by Joseph Smith in relation to the economic welfare of the saints in the early days, this modern Prophet led the Church to establish a system which manifests the marks of true religion and pure brotherly love. ) The religious message of President Grant can best be summarized in his oft-quoted phrase: "Latterday Saints, keep the commandments of God!" He stressed the need for developing spiritual righteousness through proper living as a forerunner of the higher spirituality toward which mankind should be striving. He often said that the burden of his message could be found in this threeword message, "Keep the commandments." One of the great traits of President Grant's character was his generosity. In later years his business prospered remarkably and relieved 717 OD 0 D-DD) Dl) 0) SD) ED () D-DD () SD () ' WURLITZER ORGAN ENSEMBLE ". - - The ability to add one stop to another as in a pipe organ gives the WURLITZER the ENSEMBLE that all organists need, particularly for Church music."

I read and enjoy the Magazine from cover to cover, especially the poetry. —Ruby Newman, Mesa, Arizona I enjoy the articles and stories in the Magazine, and also the lessons and the poetry. It would be impossible to list the many helpful features, so suffice it to say "thanks" and best wishes for continued success. I feel very happy if I manage to have something published, and consider it an honor to be in The Relief Society Magazine. —Norma Wrathall, Murray, Utah The serial story "Joanna" is one of the very best ever published in the Magazine and I send thanks to Margery S. Stewart for this thoughtful and entertaining contribution to my joy in reading. —Lynn W. Brown, Logan, Utah I have had the Magazine for a number of years, enjoyed reading it, but never got the real good of it until this fall when I fell and broke my hip. I have been in bed for seven months and this has given me time to read the Magazine and really get the meaning of it. Many times I have read a Magazine over twice. It has been a great comfort to me and I do look forward to it every month and I hope and pray that others may understand the good in this Magazine and subscribe for it. JI was born in a foreign country and had to work hard after coming here to learn the language, but I thank my Heavenly Father that I am here in this lovely land, where we can enjoy life. —Emma Handley, Salt Lake City, Utah I do enjoy The Relief Society Magazine so much. For about twenty years I was only in touch with the Church through the Church magazines and once in a long time a visit from the missionaries. But I am so thankful to have a branch organized in Alliance now. —Zelma F. Boesch, Alliance, Ohio Page 720 I do enjoy your excel
