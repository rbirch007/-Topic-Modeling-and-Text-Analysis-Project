opportunity for the child to be studied and for the adoptive parents to have reasonable assurance of his normal development. The laws of a number of states require that the child remain in the adoptive home for six months or a year before the adoption is made final. Agencies of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE-—OCTOBER 1949 recognized standing, even in states that have no such legal provision, require such a trial period; and many of them advise that the final adoption be delayed until the child has been in the home for one or two years. Moreover, if the adoptive parents have the assistance and advice of such an agency during this period, the progress and development of the child can be studied; and if situations of an undesirable nature arise, the adoption plans can be terminated. _ The law in Utah, as in many other states, prohibits placement of children for adoption outside the State. Therefore agencies in Utah are unable to place children in homes for adoption outside of the State. Operating under the direction of the Relief Society General Board Association in Salt Lake City, is an agency licensed for the purpose of placement of children for adoption and foster-home care in the State of Utah only. The general policies and procedures for this agency are the same as those previously pointed out for all adoption agencies, with the exception of the eligibility requirements of religion. In order for a couple to be considered eligible to receive a child for adoption, they must be active Latter-day Saints, observing and adhering to the standards of the Church. Staffed by professional personnel trained to handle the problems of adoption, sound adoption principles are practiced and every attempt is made to meet the needs of the child, the real mother, and the adoptive parents. t uses, el ly whe Nght closed in he atly and blotted oy any possible 2 aah ce ne eens ee VISION Of the frail or barns; amet cranked the h dle of the father are SY on
