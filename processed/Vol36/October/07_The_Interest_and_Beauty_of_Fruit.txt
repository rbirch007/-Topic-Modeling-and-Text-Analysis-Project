yself." When parents are lovers of books and great readers, they usually hand down the same interest to their children. One young girl who had always been a scholar and an avid reader decided that when she had ter for each age group. At intervals for many years, the young wife and mother studied the book. When financial conditions did not allow for the purchase of a book every month for every child, she gave preference to keeping on building a library for the oldest one, since the younger ones had access to the books purchased in previous years. EDITORIAL Birthdays, Christmases and childish illnesses also provided opportunity for additional gift books. In this way the children had "measle" books, "tonsilectomy" books, etc. It was well that the mother would go to make her purchases armed with a list of desired books, for, too often, a clerk was most interested in selling a book just off the press when the mother preferred to buy a book which had stood the test of time with many children. The children's most treasured books were their own books of scripture with their names embossed in gold upon the leather covers. These they used all through seminary and Sunday School, proud in their ownership. Over the years each child of this family became a well-read individual. With the many amusements offered young people these days— 675 movies, radio, television, and the great number of school activities which they engage in—it is all too easy to find children neglecting to tread choice books. Parents who read to their children and unobtrusively guide their reading habits by generously providing appropriate books, introduce them into a wonderful world wherein they may always find "the best of friends." Building an individual library for each child is a worthwhile project for any family. Then, as each child marries, he will carry with him to his new home the treasured volumes, which reflect his own growth in reading experiences, to form the nucleus of his own family library through which, in future years, he and his family may find lasting enjoyment and companionship at their own hearthstone.

The Interest and Beauty of Fruit Mary Grant Judd Member, Relief Society General Board [This is the sixth in a series of short articles on table decorations, flower arrangements, and related subjects. In the coming months Sister Judd will present other suggestions suitable to particular seasons.—Ed.] HO was it said that "Variety is the spice of life?" No matter, for though the statement has been so often repeated as to become almost trite, it is still axiomatic. What a marvelous example nature sets in the interest she gives us through variety. As I write I am at my cabin at Brighton, in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah, sitting on the porch enjoying the early morning sunshine. And I'm thinking: how wonderful that there are never two of those tall pine trees just alike; never two slippery rocks, in the dashing creek down there at the foot of the hill, which duplicate each other; and never two of those great billowy cloud masses in exactly the same form. I'm thinking especially this morning of the limitless variety one finds in the colors, contours, and textures, as well as flavors, of fruits and vegetables. (The latter, with their decorative possibilities, will be discussed next month). It is as if Mother Nature tries to intrigue our imaginations as she tempts our appetites with her myriad products. Does a peach produce fuzz on the surface, I'm wondering, because a peach skin is thin? Then what about an apricot? Why is a watermelon smooth on the outside while its cousin, the cantaloupe, is rough? Parenthetically, I'd like to pass on a bit from Wilham Jennings Bryan, Page 676 showing that he used his imagination as he contemplated a watermelon. He said that while eating a piece of this thirst-quenching fruit, he was struck with the miracle of its beauty. He weighed some of the seeds and found that it would tequire several thousand to make a pound and yet he had been eating a melon weighing in the neighborhood of thirty pounds. One of these watermelon seeds put into the ground and surrounded by favorable conditions "takes off its coat and goes to work." From somewhere the seed gathers over a hundred thousand times its own weight and constructs a watermelon. "It ornaments the outside with a covering of green; inside the green it puts a layer of white, and within the white a core of red, and all through the red it scatters seeds, each one capable of continuing the work of reproduction." In conclusion, Mr. Byran asks: "Where does it get its tremendous strength? Where does it find its coloring matter? How does it collect its flavoring extract?" Considering the great amount of interest, as well as beauty, that fruit holds, it is no wonder that many of us love an arrangement of fruit, for a change, as a table decoration. Most people prefer a combination of several fruits, but the beautiful simplicity of one variety—such as gtapes—can be very striking. In our illustration, green seed- THE INTEREST AND BEAUTY OF FRUIT less grapes spill out of an antique brass container and are wired to the base of the container as well as to the brass candlesticks which flank it. White candles look well in this arrangement, or you may care to use yellow, to tie in with the brass, or green to harmonize with the grapes. Sometimes fruit and flowers are combined to good effect. Many of our readers may have seen, at a recent general board reception at conference time, a combination of bronze chysanthemums and leafy branches loaded with small apples. (Yes, the apples were real. I pinched one myself to find out!) Some fruits are more intriguing when cut. A few crescents of luscious cantaloupe look well when placed with other fruits. And while the deep red of the rind of a pomegranate adds color Simmons Photo Art Studio 677 to any fruit basket, it cannot compare with the interest of this somewhat rare fruit when it is halved to show its tiny red globules lying sO symmetrically in individual sections. A delicious ripe pineapple when halved lengthwise with the interesting leaves left on, makes an exotic addition to any fruit centerpiece (and did you know that a Pineapple is just right for eating when a slight tug at one of the leaves will easily detach it?). I urge you to use Imagination in serving fruit as a first course. I'm afraid it is often too easy to pick up the faithful can opener and open a can of fruit cocktail. If you must do this, please add fresh fruits in season, such as sliced strawberries, pitted cherries, either light or dark, raspberries, or melon balls.

At the risk of being accused of stepping into other territory than my particular subject covers, I'm going to tell you how I like to make fruit cup. I always use as a base my own pureed apricot juice which I combine with equal parts of canned grapefruit juice. Add a small amount of fresh orange juice, also. You will need to add some sugar, depending on the tartness of the fruit you are using. Combine almost any fresh fruits—it is almost impossible to RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 go wrong. From early spring until late fall I always pick four or five long pieces of spearmint from the garden and tuck them well down into the bottle of fruit cup which is placed in the refrigerator at least two hours before it is served.

Here is all I do: I wash the rice three or more times, then I put it in boiling water, about 2 quarts of water to a cup of rice. I stir it once to get the rice from the bottom of the kettle, then I boil it without stirring the rest of the time. When the rice is done I put it in a colander and let cold water run through the grains. If you are serving the rice plain, put it in the oven to heat and to take out the rest of the moisture. Page 679 Joanna Margery S. Stewart CHAPTER 10 Synopsis: Joanna, widowed when her children were small, courageously works into a profitable business selling Bostonbaked beans and bakery goods. Her neighbor, Abigail Smith, as a_ partner, gives much hard work and good advice. Joanna, placing the welfare of her children first, buys a comfortable home from Kent Taylor, a writer, acting temporarily as a real estate agent. In order to attend a P. T. A. Meeting, Joanna breaks a date with Kent and he leaves town. Joanna and Abigail open a number of new shops and Joanna finds her life enriched with many new friends and the abiding love of her children. Kent Taylor returns from an assignment in Europe and asks Joanna to marry him. In order to become Kent's wife, Joanna plans to leave her children in Abigail's care for six months while Kent will be stationed in New York. Just before the wedding, however, Joanna decides that she cannot leave her children, especially while Penny is going out with a young man of questionable character. That would take Kent away. She had intended to go speak to him, wish him well. But when she saw the crowd around him, she put aside the desire. She could not bear to say her farewells before their curious eyes. Kent looked thinner; he was carrying his hat and his bright hair was like a banner in the drab gray and black of pavement and trains and tracks. Joanna stood on the outskirts of a group of people seeing a girl off to school. She watched Kent shake hands with his friends. His sister was a tall, gray-haired woman, who dabbed at her eyes. J iat vo went down to the train Kent kissed her and said something in his slow, teasing way. Joanna turned away. Rebellion seized her. It was like closing a door on rich, vivid beauty, on laughter, and adventure and tenderness. For a wild, anguished moment she thought she must go to him, push aside the people and cry out his name, and be held in peace against him. She wet her dry lips and went away. Abigail met her at the door. Had been crying. Joanna paused. "What is it? One of the children?" Abigail shook her head. "It's you. Come in by the fire and let me bring you something to drink. You've looked like death for the past few days." Joanna asked, "Where is Penny?" Abigail smiled. "Not with that Tom youll be glad to know. She's down arranging for those music lessons you promised her. Mothers have been phoning." "Mothers?" "Penny's friends. 'Their mothers want to thank you for breakin' the ice. Now they can do the same for their daughters." Joanna sank into the flowered chair by the fireplace. She looked into the slim mirror that stood above the small table on the opposite wall. She made a wry face and pulled off her hat. "SomePage 681 She 682 thing's gone out of me. I look like an old woman." Abigail brought her a glass of milk and some thin, buttered toast. 'Nonsense! You never looked lovelier... In a peaked sort of way. I think... I think you are a beautiful woman." "Goodness!" said Joanna, "you've never paid me such a compliment. Where's Sally?" "Rehearsing for a Mutual play. She insists that you have all the cast here after the play. If you can do it for Penny, she thinks you can do it for her." Joanna sipped her milk. "Of course I can. I will have plenty of time, now, plenty of time.' She put the glass down. "Sally's a practical little thing." "She's not stardust and poetry," Abigail agreed. "But she has a good head on her shoulders. Makes me think of you." Joanna slumped back wearily. "What would I do without you, Abigail?" Abigail sat in the opposite chair and reached for the knitting that hung in the blue bag over the arm. "David wants to join the navy air corps." "T know," Joanna said. "If I can just make him wait another year." "Let him go, Joanna. He will come back." "Abigail? How do you know?" Abigail bent over her knitting. "I just know. Let him go, Joanna. It will be all right." * * * * HE years that had flown so swiftly now dragged interminably. The hours in the day between the postman's visits were slow RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 agony. But, as new day obliterated yesterday, Joanna ceased to watch. There would be no letter ftom Kent. Typical of him, to cut with a surgeon's brutal neatness the lump of pain, lest it grow cancerous. I should do the same, she thought. She watched the papers. When they carried brief items about him she cut the paragraphs and put them in the bottom drawer of her desk. A national magazine carried an article of his. On the front page she found his picture. He looked startlingly gaunt. His hair had been cut close to his head. He had been in Poland. Joanna wondered if he had time or wish to think of her at all. She put the picture with the clippings. She had little time to brood. David went into the Navy Air Corps. Joanna's nights now included torturing dreams of a burning plane spinning to earth. But the house was alive and noisy and young with the activities of her children. Penny was enthusiastic about her music. The grand piano Joanna bought her was seldom silent when she was home. Sally brought the better part of her class home every afternoon, and Joanna coming home would find the living room and dining room filled with bright-eyed youngsters who were beautifully courteous and forever hungry. Michael was a boy scout and took to sleeping out in the back yard, or rising before dawn to go on never-ending hikes. He _ eluded Joanna and she grieved over him. She had never had time to know her youngest. She felt awkward with him, not knowing his life. It seemed secret and apart, peopled JOANNA with strange boys called "Stink" and "Clip" and "Saddy." Tossing restlessly one Saturday morning, Joanna heard Michael rise and move about his room. She rose, too, and threw her robe about her. He was tiptoeing down the stairs when she caught up with him. "Michael, where are you going?" She leaned over the railing and he tilted his head to look at her. Joanna almost cried out, his resemblance to his father was so strong. He grinned. "Just out. It's almost light." "But where?" "Got a place I gotta see. Don't worry about me, Mom. If I hitch a ride I'll be back before noon." "T can't sleep. Can I drive you?" "Say! Would you, Mom?" She accepted his delight as if it had been a gift of pearls. "Just a minute. I'll be ready." She dashed back to her room and found an old gray skirt and a black sweater and _ black, low-heeled pumps. She tossed a short red jacket over her shoulders and went downstairs. Michael was in the kitchen filling his knapsack. "We'll be hungry, Mom." They stole out to the garage and, feeling like a fugitive, Joanna switched on the ignition and eased down the driveway. "Where to?" "Up Lamb's Canyon." HEY drove down the dark, deserted streets. It had rained and the air was heavy with the smell of rich summer earth and roses and rain-wet leaves. '""This is exciting," Joanna said. 683 "This isn't half of it." Michael leaned back against the cushion. It was beginning to be light when they reached the cariyon, but the underbrush on either side was still black and the mountains were blacker against the pearl sky. A deer bounded across the road. Michael cried out. Joanna stole a look at his freckled, blunt little face. It was ecstatic. They reached a bend in the road and Michael said, "Here, Mother. Stop here." Obediently, she parked the car a little off the road. He was out in a moment, like a caged thing set free. "Now you just come along with me. I'll show you something." She followed him along the dewwet path, hugging her arms over her breast to keep out the chill. He plunged ahead of her, reminding her of a small puppy, sniffing the wind, reading the sky. His hand reached out to touch every tree they passed, as if they were friends. He paused, finally, beside a small, hurtling stream. "This is a good place. Now watch me build a fire." Joanna leaned against the bole of a tree and watched him pick up twigs and arrange them carefully in a wigwam effect. He lighted a match and knelt to hold it against a tiny curl of paper. 'There was a fullness in Joanna of tears and laughter. 'The laughter she could hold, but the tears scattered on her face. She wiped them away quickly with the back of her hand and went to kneel beside the tiny blaze. "One match," he prodded. "T saw, Michael. I think you're wonderful." He opened his knapsack and took 684 out a frying pan, two plates, forks and knives, bacon, and eggs. By a great effort, Joanna kept from telling him that the pan was too hot for the bacon. She sat on a rock and breathed in the smell of pine and river, and listened to the small creek hurl itself over stones and around the bend. 'The bacon was slightly burned, but the eggs were fried to a queen's taste. Joanna ate hungrily and held out her plate for more. "You come here alone?" He smiled at her crookedly, bread making a lump in his cheek. "Every chance I get. You have it all to yourself this time of the morning. You get to see the sun come up and when it's half light, like this, you can pretend you're the only person who ever came here." He poked the fire with a stick, It crackled under his touch and sparks flew upward to the lightening sky. Joanna's fork made a little clink when she put it on the plate. "It was nice of you to let me come here." He buttered another slice of bread and spread it generously with strawberry jam. "Sometimes I pretend you're here with me. I show you things... Way up on the hill." "Oh," said Joanna, "I wish I had known." HE took a big bite of the bread. 'When I'm grown up I'm going to have some land. Lots of it. Miles and miles of it, if folks haven't used it all up. Mom, do you think people will have bought up all the land? Will there be just cities all over?" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 "T don't think so, Michael. What will you do with all your acres?" "Plant wheat, oats, have cattle. You can come and live with me and we'll sell the old bakeries. You can just sit in a chair all day long and look at my land." "When I am an old lady," she agreed gravely, "I'll rock in the sun and watch for you to come home from the fields." He sighed deeply. "Won't that be perfect though? I I pray for it every night." He looked at her shyly. He cleaned up the camp and afterwards they climbed the hill and sat side by side, watching the sun come over the ridge. 'Twigs snapped around them from the feet of small hidden things, and birds began a wild caroling. "This has been good, Michael. Let me come again,' Joanna pleaded. He rose with her and led her down to the car. "We'll do this lots. I know even better places than this, places that Stink and Saddy haven't any idea about." "What do Stink and Saddy call you, Michael?": "Henderson." "Good heavens! Why?" He looked at her and grinned, "T never asked them why." They reached home just as the others were coming down for breakfast. Sally and Penny eyed them. "Where have you two been?" Joanna was aware of Michael's tenseness. "Oh, around," she said vaguely, and was repaid by his sudden relieved clatter up the stairs. (To be continued ) Home Satety—a Family Affair Nellie O. Parker Former Member, Relief Society General Board distinguished speaker at the National Safety Congress held recently in Chicago said that the American home _ today needs the unifying force of religion and love; of family prayers and group projects to build strong, self-reliant, emotionally sane citizens as a safeguard for the security of the home and the Nation. A happy home where parents and children live together in love and mutual helpfulness is most likely to be a safe one too. Safety for the family depends not only upon the conditions of the house and its equipment, but also upon the physical and emotional health of both parents and children. There must be a feeling of well-being and security. Physical handicaps and emotional conflicts are causes of accidents. 'The individual who is unhappy, frightened, or worried may unconsciously bring injuries to himself or others. If he has poor muscular co-ordination, defective vision, or impaired hearing, mishaps can easily happen. Special care must be taken to protect such a one. It is important for parents to provide an environment of safety as well as creating an atmosphere of love and sympathetic understanding. They should strive to instill a feeling of confidence in each child that he may step forward unafraid. 'The learning of the right safety attitudes and habits is fundamental in establishing this self-assurance. The burden of responsibility rests with parents, but safety at home cannot be attained without the co-operation of the whole family. Teamwork is the key to success. Parents and older members of the household must practice the rules of safety. Children will unconsciously imitate their elders. If father puts his tools in a safe place and, in case there is a gun, he unloads and dismantles it immediately and then locks it securely away, the children will be set a good ex: ample and many a life will be saved. Children will usually enter into a family project with enthusiasm especially if their interest is kindled. They will take pride in keeping their clothing hung up and their toys put away if the storage places are glamorized. Incorporate safety in every activity of a child's day, his health chores and his play. Teach him to climb only as high as his age warrants, not to run with a lollipop stick or a pencil in his mouth, to hold points of scissors down and cut with a knife away rather than toward his body. Parents should use judgment in choosing the appropriate time to teach a child the proper way to use such things as scissors, knives, skates, scooter, etc. [E is wise to appease a child's curiosity. Let him see what is cooking on the stove—he will be less tempted to pull the pot on to himself. Show him how the food mixPage 685 686 er works. Let him strike the matches, under close supervision, for his birthday candles. Explain the danger of doing things the wrong way. The right way is always the safe way. Encourage children to be alert, to detect and report the hazard they find that it may be either repaired or eliminated. Teach children to be courteous and thoughtful, especially to other children. The polite child is, in most cases, a safe child. Examples of courtesy set by the parents and regard for the well-being of others will largely determine the children's behavior in this regard. Living the golden rule in the home will pay dividends. Thoughtlessness is the virus that is the insidious breeder of many home casualties. Some parents are being indicted for their thoughtlessness and outright carelessness, for poor and inadequate supervision of their children. Half of the fatal accidents to children occur under their own roofs and in their own yards. 'These casualties usually happen in moments of inattention or careless lack of supervision by their parents or guardians. It is inhuman to leave little ones alone in any situation where their lives could be endangered—such as leaving baby in the bathtub while mother answers the telephone, or locking him in the house or in the family car while parents shop or go to a show. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 Older children can share responsibility in safeguarding their smaller brothers and sisters if they are impressed with the importance of their charge. They can also bring home and apply the safety rules they have learned at school. Organized effort is needed to bring safety education to parents. It has been proved in campaigns against disease—diphtheria, smallpox—that when parents know and are shown how, they act to protect their children. National statistics tell us that home accidents—over 34,000 deaths in 1948—still remain the number one killer in the accident field. Communicable diseases have been controlled and reduced as much as sixty to ninety per cent in some fields. Accidents have become the leading cause of death among children in the United States. They also bring the greatest loss of productive life of any cause not only of adults but also in the potential contribution that the stricken children might have made to the world. Home safety means good housekeeping, keeping an orderly, smoothrunning home—a place for everything and everything in its place— house and equipment in good tepair and a happy, loving family, working together to keep accidents out of their realm. -— Secrets Elizabeth Johnson Probe not too deeply The corners of the heart; Probe not profoundly Lest the tears should start. Let's Do Better Embroidery Doris Feil N the seventeen years that I have been a member of the Church, I have attended many bazaars and similar functions sponsored by the Relief Society and other auxiliaries of the Church and, because embroidery is my own hobby, I have handled and examined countless pieces of needlework: dish towels, pillowcases, napkins, luncheon cloths, children's clothes, aprons, and other items, large and small. Every needlewoman should realize that all needlework has two sides, the front or "on-display side," and the back, or "you're-looking-atthe-wrong-side," of the article. Wherever handwork is judged competitively, it is the neat back and not the impressive-looking front of an embroidered article that is always the criterion of its workmanship and the sign of finished skill in the needlewoman. There is no need for the back of our embroidery to be an untidy hodge-podge of knots, loose ends, long loops of thread going from one leaf or flower or stem to another. It is just as easy to do embroidery that is, to all intents and purposes, reversible. This takes very little longer, is amazingly easy to do, and is well worth any little extra time and effort. Let us suppose, for instance, that you are embroidering a simple spray of flowers on a napkin. You arc going to use satin stitch for the flowers, outline or stem stitch for the stalk, and a bunch of French knots for the center of the flower. Use a crewel needle for best results. These are fine and strong, yet they have large, easily threaded eyes. With two, or at the most three strands of embroidery thread in your needle, you start off on the flower stalk. On the right side of the material, about a third of an inch from the end, take four or five tiny running stitches back to the starting point. Pull until the end of your thread is barely above the surface of the material—and of course you have no knot in your thread. Then start embroidering, using regular outline stitch, directly over your little running stitches. Your embroidery will hide them completely and hold them firm. When you reach the end of the stalk, draw your thread through to the other side and on the wrong side take half a dozen more tiny running stitches back over the part you have just finished embroidering. Cut off the end. Both the beginning and the end of your thread are firmly held and completely invisible, without any unsightly knots and untidy ends. For the satin stitch petals of the flower, you do exactly the same thing. Take half a dozen little running stitches rght on the petal of the flower to the starting point, and then embroider over it until you reach the end of the petal. Bring your thread through to the wrong Page 687 688 side and then pass the thread under the embroidery on the wrong side for about a quarter to a half inch and cut flat with the cloth. Again, no knots, no ends, and your embroidery is as pretty on the wrong side as it is on the right. HE cluster of French knots in the center offers a little different problem, but the solution is just as easy. Because of the type of stitch you are using, it is not so easy to start with running stitches and work over them. But this problem may be solved by having a big, beautiful knot at the end of the thread and starting it on the right side. Why not? You are going to have a cluster of some dozen or so knots right there, so why not have your starting knot on the right side where it will be lost in the crowd, so to speak, rather than on the wrong side where it will be conspicuous and ugly. Finish off with another knot, also on the right side, and all you will have to show on the wrong side will be a little cluster of neat, tiny, seed stitches. Most of the common stitches used in embroidery can be adapted to this neat and effective way of commencing and finishing the work. With cross-stitch, I do the same thing and start without any knot in my thread but with a few running stitches across the center of the crosses, which the embroidery itself later covers. And in finishing, I take a few invisible stitches underneath the cross-stitching that has already been done. Much of the perfection of a finished piece lies in the careful seRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 lection of materials as well as in the embroidery itself. Every woman knows what wonderful dish towels can be made out of used, bleached flour sacks. Aprons, also, can be made out of these readily available materials, either plain or dyed in various shades. But where a lot of time and effort is going into the work, it pays in the long run to spend a little more and buy the best of materials. A lovely little luncheon cloth with a simple design can be made out of dyed flour sacking, and it will take a lot of hard wear for everyday use, but, if you are going to do an intricate design such as a cutwork cloth and napkins, only the best linen should be used and then you will have an exquisite piece that you can use all your life and your children can use and cherish after you are gone. Cheap rayons, thin cottons, any material that is not colorfast or guaranteed against shrinkage is not worth the buying, nor the time and effort spent in working it. It hardly seems necessary to say that it is important to make sure that the thread, also, is colorfast and able to stand up to hard wear and constant washing. Nowadays, most threads are thus guaranteed, whether they are silk, cotton, rayon or wool. By following these simple rules we can do beautiful embroidery that reflects exquisite neatness on both sides—embroidery work which will wash and wear and last long enough to become heirlooms in the family.

LESSON ie} DEPARTMENT Sheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 20—"Continuation of the Perean and Judean Ministry" concluded, and "The Last Winter" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, by Elder James E. Talmage, latter part of Chapter 27 and Chapter 28) For Tuesday, January 3, 1950 Objective: To prove by cumulative evidence that Jesus was indeed the greatest teacher mankind has ever known. On Marriage and Divorce O question is or can be more important to society than the preservation of the home. The perpetuity of the oneness between man and wife, and, therefore, the purity of the home, lies at the very foundation of progress and civilization. It is easy to see why the Pharisees sought to trap Jesus when they met him as he slowly made his way toward Jerusalem. Hoping that he 'would denounce the ruler, Herod Antipas, who was living in adultery, the Pharisees asked: "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?" Among the Jews there were widely divergent views as to divorce. One school contended that divorce should be given a man on the slightest provocation. Another school contended that divorce should be granted only for violation of the law of chastity. When the question last quoted was put to Jesus, he cited the eternal law of God. And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder (Matt. 19:4-6). God has provided for honorable marriage. No earthly relationship is more sacred than that of husband and wife. Jesus superseded the law of Moses regarding divorce. It is plain that only by a strict compliance with the doctrine as he taught it, can a true order governing society be maintained. In the days of Jesus, men had practically made slaves of women. By the law of God it is intended that they shall be companions and partners. Jesus is the greatest friend and champion of women the world has ever known. His gospel completely emancipates women. Marriage was instituted of the Lord and is highly honorable. It should not be treated lightly. Page 695 696 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 A Perry Picture From a Painting by Hofmann CHRIST AND THE RICH YOUNG MAN Jesus and the Little Ones In logical sequence, Jesus followed his instructions regarding matriage with a tender lesson regarding little children. Mothers brought their little children to him for a blessing. 'The disciples rebuked these mothers, seeking thereby to save the Savior from unnecessary trouble and worry. 'These disciples, however, must be taught a lesson. Jesus rebuked them and in sweet tones said: "... Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God" (Mark 10:14). That blessing was in no sense a baptism "... Little children need no repentance, neither baptism... But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world..." (Moroni 8:11-12). Jesus took the children in his arms, one by one, and blessed them. "One Thing Thou Lackest"' A young man came to Jesus and knelt at his feet inquiring: "Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?" The reply was: "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." In answer to the young man's further inquiry as to which commandments were meant, Jesus explained that they included particularly those against murder, adultery, theft, and the bearing of false witness. Jesus told him also that he should honor his parents and should love his neighbor as himself. 'The young man said: All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus said 698 life—the greatest of all gifts—and that he and the Father are one. "In the original Greek one appears in the neuter gender and, therefore, expresses oneness in attributes, power, or purpose, and not a oneness of personality which would have required the masculine form." (See note 3 end of chapter 28 of the text. ), On a previous occasion when he proclaimed himself the "I AM" he had told them he was greater than Abraham. He made it plain that he was not the earthly king for whom they were looking. He was the true Christ—the Eternal King. The Jews were so enraged that they made an unsuccessful attempt on the Lord's life within the environs of the temple. He calmly called their attention to the fact that he had done many good works among them and asked "... For which of those works do ye stone me?" Angrily they replied: "For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God" (John 10:32-33). He cited the scriptures wherein even judges empowered by divine authority are called Gods. If this was written in their law, surely he who had been sent by the Father could not be accused of blasphemy when he said he was the Son of God. Again the Jews sought to take Jesus, but his time had not yet come and they were foiled in their attempt. Our Lord's Retirement in Perea The Lord must further instruct his apostles before the time of his sacrifice should come. He retired with them into Perea, beyond Jordan. He went back to the place RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 where John the Baptist had commenced his ministry. Just how long he remained in Perea is not known. He left in response to an earnest appeal from Mary and Martha who dwelt in Bethany near Jerusalem. Lazarus Restored to Life Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, was seriously ill. Jesus loved these two sisters and also the brother. When he heard the urgent appeal: "Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick,' he remarked: "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby." Jesus waited two days after receiving word of Lazarus' illness before announcing to the disciples that he was returning to Judea. Mindful of the danger through which he had recently passed, they tried to dissuade him from going. The Lord made it clear that he would not be deterred from doing his duty and that others ought not to be. It was his duty to return and he would go. Lazarus evidently died the day the messengers left to find Jesus. The Savior knew he was dead. "Lazarus is dead," he told the disciples, "and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him." Jesus had evidently decided to perform a miracle even before he started. Lazarus "had lain in the grave four days already" when Jesus arrived at Bethany of Judea. The two mourning sisters were at home when the word reached Martha of the near approach of the Savior. She hastened out and met him with these words: "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died,' and added: LESSON DEPARTMENT "but I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee," Jesus spoke assuringly: "Thy brother shall rise again." Those who heard seemed to understand that he had reference to the resurrection. (Read John 11:25-27,) Martha notified Mary secretly and bade her go and meet the Lord. Marty used almost the exact words that Martha used in greeting the Master. The sight of the prief. Stricken women caused Jesus to weep, and he directed that he be taken to the grave wherein lay the body of Lazarus. "It was a Cave, and a stone lay upon it." Jesus asked that the stone be removed and, after uttering a prayer of thanksgiving to his Father, "he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth." Lazatus obeyed and the Lord commanded others to loose him from the graveclothes with which he was bound. This was not a case of resurrection from death to immortality. The spirit of Lazarus was called back to his dead body and he lived again in mortality. The miracle was performed not only to assuage the guief of the beloved sisters, but also that "the works of God should be made manifest." The Hierarchy Greatly Agitated Over the Miracle The raising of Lazarus from the 699 gtave by Jesus caused gteat excitement, and the Jews tried to get Lazarus into their power that they might kill him and "silence forever his testimony of the Lord's power over death." Jesus in Retirement at Ephraim To avoid the Jewish hostility, the Lord retired to a place called Ephraim, that he might spend the rest of the winter instructing his disciples. When he emerged from this Place it was to commence "his solemn march toward Jerusalem and the cross," Questions and Suggestions for _ Discussion 1. What was the law given by Jesus regarding divorce? In what way was Jesus a great champion of women? 2. Wherein should we be like little children? 3.

Feed My Lambs" (John 21:15) Mary Grant Judd For Tuesday, January 3, 1950 Objective: To point out that this admonition is equally important today. HE writer has often wondered why it was that preceding his admonition to Peter (twice repeated) to "feed my sheep," the Savior told him to "feed my lambs." It might appear that he was thinking of the spiritual food of children and that it was equally important to that of adults. Nowhere is our Savior's great tenderness shown more clearly than when he was in the company of little children. How he loved them and how at home they must have felt in his presence as he gathered them into his arms and _ blessed them! 'To call them lambs and he their shepherd was fitting, for, in ancient times, the shepherd had so small a flock that he knew each individual sheep or lamb. 'They, in turn, knew the voice of their Shepherd and answered when he called. This entreaty "Feed my lambs" (John 21:15), should be as appealing in our day as when it was first given. A child's mind cannot remain'a vacuum. If it is not filled with worthwhile ideas, worthless ones may find lodgment there. Neither can a child's heart remain untouched. Some modem mothers have thought to let their children wait until they are old enough to decide which religion they prefer. What a mistaken idea! We all know that the most important impressions are made before a child is old enough to go to school. The modern mother is, for the most part, very careful about the food which she gives her growing child to sustain his physical needs. What about the food for his spirit? Is she equally careful? President David O. McKay has said that "there is an eternal part of us that will outlive the sun, the moon and even the earth itself." Just as a child's body needs food to nourish it, just as his mind needs mental exercise, so his spiritual nature needs refreshment and this need is equally as imperative as those of body and brain. We are but following in the Savior's footsteps when we make the child the object of our constant thought and solicitude. William Jennings Bryan contributed some significant ideas on the power of children to comprehend religious teachings. It is when we deal with the child that we get the clearest conception of faith over reason. The foundations of character are laid in faith not in reason; they are laid before the reason can be accepted as a guide. No one who exalts reason above LESSON DEPARTMENT faith can lead a child to God, but a child can understand the love of the Saviour and the tender care of the Heavenly Father... Morality rests upon religion and religion, taking hold upon the heart, 701 exercises a control far greater than any logic can exercise Over the mind. If we love our Savior, we will feed his lambs. Work Tleeting—Sewing Children's Clothing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 4—Underwear and Nightwear Jean Ridges Jennings For Tuesday, January 10, 195° ONE of the important advantages of home sewing is economy. It is not always economical to make all garments at home. Some kinds of underwear are examples of this. It would be well to study carefully the problem and see which articles of underclothing are best purchased in a store and which can be more advantageously handmade. In general, knit garments, such as vests and panties, come under the classification of those that should be purchased ready-made. However, there are times when partially worn larger knit underwear can be remade into smaller articles at a considerable saving. For all underclothing and nightwear, the first important feature to insist upon is absorbency, and, of course, after moisture is absorbed it should be able to rapidly evaporate. It is more healthful and comfortable for body moisture to be readily absorbed into clothing and as readily evaporated from it. Bird's-eye type of cotton is rated high for these qualities. Other smooth surface cottons absorb moisture quickly. Wool, because it does not absorb readily and gives up its moisture slowly, is not so good for underwear. Underthings that can be made at home at a great saving are slips and summer panties for little girls and night clothes for both boys and girls. When making panties be sure that the crotches are full enough so they do not bind. Seams should be firm and flat. Be sure leg bands and waistbands are not too tight. A good way to finish the waist is to have a fitted band across the front, with elastic at least one half inch wide only at the back. Underslips can be made to fit from the shoulder or may be only from the waist down. Make them dainty and attractive. For these, a ruffle around the bottom always delights the small child. Sew these or any other ruffles on with a standing fell seam. It is neat and durable. Make it by sewing the ruffle evenly to the plain edge, right sides _together. Trim the raw edge of the ruffle to one-fourth inch or less. Now turn in the other raw edge of Wer pelt dF h garment SId€ seams, use a Frenc seam, 4nged often.

Literature supremely worthy of our We love best that which we understand most thoroughly. To know the Bible as a work of beauty, to identify its Power over men throughout time, to know the story of how our Bible has grown into its present form— these intensify its sacredness by bringing it more intimately into our Own minds and hearts. For those who love and believe the Bible, it is the Holy Bible, which Is as it should be. But in our zeal to learn its teachings that we might become doers of the word, often we forget to appreciate the magical beauty of the vessel in which Holy Writ is conveyed to us. While we recognize translation as the source of potential and actual error in doc. Trine, we must not forget to Marvel that the original wedding of holithen, the King James Bible is the fruit of a great love, 703 That they caught the great vision of the Bible cannot be doubted, SO successThe Bible js more than fact; it Is emotion and spirit as well, Fac. Tual books are necessary and good, but man's destiny is formed by valbrilliance and spiritual exaltation. As does all great literature, the Bible does speak to the head, but only after the message has first warmed and fed thre heart. For example, attempt to read the following sentences without allowing them to influence the emotions: "The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork" (Psalms, 19:1). "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void: and 704 darkness was upon the face of the earth" (Genesis 1:1-2). Immediately one senses a certain scope and depth, a liberating vision of the inner eye which sets such words apart as uncommon clay. Such writing speaks not to the reason alone, but to the moving spirit within. It has the unmistakable singing voice of great poetry. Its majesty, its simplicity, have Captured the greatness of the original and its power strikes a note not to be confused with any other. Once we contrast such prose with the excellent but imperfect translations which preceded 1611, (see text, pp. 521-523), or with the flat modem translations, we understand more fully why the King James Version is read by more than ninety per cent of all English-speaking Christians. As we have already pointed out, the King James Version is great litcrature because it excels both in content and in the beauty of its exPression when translated into English. The background of all its books and the patterns of thought are Oriental, but the cadence and tone of its language, the flowing ease in which the ideas are ex. Pressed, owe a great debt to the original authors and also to those who finally translated the Bible into English. Thus the Bible com: bines the best of these 'two traditions which have many characteristics common to both; a high seriousneéss, a passion for truth and right, and a broad view of life. When such qualities were caught and preserved in the almost perfect phrases of the English language, a memorable blending was produced. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1949 OW let us suppose together. Suppose your Relief Society classroom was whisked away to seventeenth-century England, there to be transformed immediately into Hampton Court, where a conference of churchmen from all England is meeting. The year: 1604. Presiding: James I, King of England. Speaking: Dr. John Reynolds, President of Corpus Christi College. The question being discussed: a new translation of the Bible. If your group numbers between forty-seven and fifty-four, it was a group of scholars just your size which was appointed to translate the Bible. Suppose you were one of these most learned gentlemen in England, trained in language and theology, devoutly religious, and humble at making an attempt at restating the very word of God. Fear, and suffocation under your emotional and spiritual load, might well engulf you. Yet for thirtythree months the six groups of scholars (two each at Oxford, Cambridge, and Westminster) worked independently and then conferred until they agreed in perfect harmony, peace, and exaltation of spirit. For nine more months two men from each group met daily as a revising committee. Finally the translation was completed in 1611, seven years after it had been proposed. You might well ask how we can know whether they worked together harmoniously, peacefully, and in exaltation of spirit. Consider the words of their translation: "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me" (John 14:1), LESSON DEPARTMENT If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love (John 15:10). The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace (Numbers 6:24-26). Here we detect the simplicity of greatness. It hardly seems possible that such serenity can be concealed in little words so common and unimpressive when arranged by pens less sensitive and sincere. As for the harmony of the Bible as a whole, it is impossible to detect lapses from the general excellence of tone which identifies the Old and the New Testament, and all the books therein. We should also remember that at the completion of the King James translation John Milton had been living for three years, while Shakespeare was to live for but five years more. That the three highest pinnacles ever reached in English (the writings of Milton and Shakespeare and the King James Version of the Bible) should thus overlap is not to be counted mere coincidence. They were written when England was fearless, aggressive, and Godfearing, and her language expanded in pace with the great hopes and loves of her mighty sons. 'The richness of invention can be measured in part by the phrases which were turned with such aptness and precision by the translators that they are seemingly forever a part of our daily speech. To attempt a listing of all images in our language which had their origins in the King James 705 Version would be out of place here; however, a few such familiar terms might well be listed: Still small voice—labor of love—broken reed—widow's mite—apple of his eye —powers that be—clear as crystal—salt of the earth—handwriting on the wall— a "Judas," etc. While undoubtedly we take such terms for granted, we should acknowledge that someone must receive the honor of creating them, and once more we must acknowledge our debt to the Bible. The Authorized Version of 1611 was by no means the final translation. From its first edition until the Revised Version was published in England in 1885, nearly a hundred translations appeared, each attempting to correct existing inaccuracies. From 1900 to 1925 more than twenty-five versions of the New Testament appeared, many apparently justified by new findings in the growing field of Bible archaeology. In 1936, however, when the book The Bible Designed to be Read as Living Literature appeared, it was found to be almost entirely in the King James Version. Never before nor since 1611 has the sympathetic, creative art of translation come near approaching the culmination of English prose which then appeared. Earlier English Translations If the Authorized Version's literary supremacy has never since been challenged, neither should we imagine that it suddenly bloomed into being beneath a mysterious gooseberry bush. Actually the socalled King James Version of 1611 706 was the third "authorized" version, since both the Great Bible of; 539 and the Bishop's Bible had been authorized by the Ki to be read at Public Worship seryices of the Church of England, The desire of the King James a new Bible, many revisions, to make good translations better, Ones [to make] one Principal good one." The Bishop's Bible (1568) was accepted by all scholars as the main man. The Bishop's Bible itself was a revision of the Great Bible (1539) which was a revision of Matthew's Bible ( 4 combination of 'fF Testament (1526) and Coverdale's Bible (1535), the first complete Bible to be printed in English.

Homer Durham For Tuesday, January 24, 1950 Objective: To show that governments exist for the benefit of man when founded on the free exercise of conscience, right and control of property, and protection of life. Modern Attempts to Secure Peace HE quest for peace is eternal. Men in all ages have sought peace from the ravages of war. Perhaps in no age has the yearning for peace been more real than in our own day. It is curious to note that international conferences held during peacetime for the purpose of preventing war actually—in our generation—date from the year 1899, the first Hague conference. The organized governments of the world meet together frequently nowadays under the charter of the United Nations or by other means to discuss their problems. Men seem to have placed the task of securing peace directly in the hands of the public official. 'This makes government a means to an end. To put it another way, modern man is attempting to use government as the instrument for securing peace just as a farmer might use a shovel as an instrument for digging an irrigation ditch. It takes a good shovel to make a good ditch. Only a proper kind of shovel will do the work intended. The same is true of government. What about government and the conditions of peace? What kind of government is needed to achieve peace? Declaration in Regard to Government and Peace Even though the Declaration regarding government and laws in general was written in 1835, its meaning is crystal clear today, in regard to the question of government and peace. 'The Declaration begins with a clarion call (verse one): We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society. This verse raises four general points. First, governments are believed to be instituted of God. 'They are, therefore, worthy of human support. They are not necessarily evil—the fruit of apostasy—as our early opponents frequently charged the Latter-day Saints with believing. Governments are for the benefit of man. Man is not to be a slave of his government. Second, the verse raises the question that, although governments as institutions were "instituted of God" for man's benefit, are all governments worthy of being classified in this category today? Are all the present systems of government worthy of the origin, "instituted of God'? Answers will subsequently be given. Third, the verse lays down the glorious principle that men are responsible for good government.

It also means that we must insist on having laws made and administered which recognize these same principles. The good and safety of society depend upon securing these rights in both domestic society and international society. They are the conditions of peace, foreign and domestic.
