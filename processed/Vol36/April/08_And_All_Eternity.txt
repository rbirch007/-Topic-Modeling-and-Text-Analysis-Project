edge which Latter-day Saints have of this dual nature makes it paramount that physical and spiritual growth go hand in hand to build a complete man or woman. Among the early revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, we read that Father Adam when he was bowed with age called his posterity together at Adam-ondi-Ahman and there blessed his family, telling them what would happen to each succeeding generation from then until the end of time (Doc. & Cov. 107:53-50). It is the most natural thing in a ai RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1949 the world for parents and children to desire to be together. Parents long for the companionship of their children, and children long for the companionship of their parents. To the mothers I really think belongs the responsibility of stimulating the Family Hour. Perhaps a thought we should keep in mind as mothers is that our children are Heavenly Father's children and that we are only their earthly parents, and that we are responsible to him for our treatment of them. We should also keep in mind that we mothers have the most glorious' mission of any mothers who have yet lived on the earth. We have tabernacled those spirit children who have been kept in reserve RES Se SR i GEORGE J. AND LUCY GRANT CANNON CHRISTMAS PARTY 1945 Front row, left to right: Thomas C. Lloyd; George C.

THE FAMILY HOUR IN LATTER-DAY SAINT HOMES for this specific time, "the dispensation of the fulness of times." We should also appreciate that we live at a time when woman and her mission are honored as_ they have never been before in the world's history; that we share in the blessings of the holy Priesthood; that we have the opportunity of having at the head of our family a man who holds the holy Priesthood. Se we come to the problem of how to keep the family together, and as parents lead them to seek for the worthwhile things of life that they may be bound to us for time and all eternity. The Lord admonished the saints early in their history to teach their children the principles of the gospel, and if this was neglected the sins of the children would fall upon the heads of the parents. It is to be hoped that most Latter-day Saint parents recognize the teaching of the gospel as a paramount duty; that they do pray with their children; they do encourage them to seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness. The Church program affords many opportunities to stress and teach righteous living. The blessing of a child should be a-day when the family gather and rejoice together that a new member has been added to their group. The ordination of the boys to the Priesthood and their advancement in the Priesthood 247 should be noted; the missionary and his or her farewell and homecoming; the boys and girls as they receive recognition in Sunday School, M. I. A., seminary, and other Church activities all make wonderful opportunities for family gatherings. Summertime, special holidays, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays, Valentines, family birthdays, vacation days, ward outings, reunions, and special days, all make opportunities for families to celebrate together.
