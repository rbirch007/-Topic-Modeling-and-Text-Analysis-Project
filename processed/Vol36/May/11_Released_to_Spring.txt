Released to Spring C. Cameron Johns The earth is cushioned velvet to the tread And May has dressed her world in flowered lace; The gilding touch of sunshine overhead Makes miracles of all the commonplace. Even down the canyoned city street, Where stone and steel resist each growing thing, The little winds are blowing soft and sweet Releasing wintered spirits into spring.
