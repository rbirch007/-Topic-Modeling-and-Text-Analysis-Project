Jones President, Spanish-American Mission Relief Society W* shall be able to wear our "nylons" a long time if we treat them with due respect. Keep an old pair of cotton gloves in the hose bag where they can be slipped on when removing your hose or putting them on. This is a good practice at any time, but especially when high prices of commodities make economy in all personal and household affairs essential. More hose are snagged from rough hands than from dining-room chair legs, and hose are more often discarded because of snagging than because they are worn out. As a matter of further protection and economy, try classifying your hose and keeping them in small paper bags. Label each bag plainly, giving the necessary information to eliminate the need of putting the hand into the hose to determine which pair is suitable to wear for each occasion.

Tanner and Secretary-Treasurer Nellie B. Bullock. Standing, left to right: Second Counselor Nellie R. Mecham; President Vida F. Swenson; First Counselor Alice B. Stephenson. In describing this outstanding accomplishment, Sister Swenson reports: "Had it not been for Sister Esthma Tanner, a devout member of our Relief Society, now seventyeight years old, we may not have begun this project. She said to the presidency: 'I have kept all of my Magazines, and have many of the earlier numbers. It would make me happy to place them where they would do the most good.' And so our collection began. We invited the membership to bring in as many Magazines as they could.... We contacted all our older members, out of-town people, and the Relief Society general board office.... Finally, all we lacked was one Magazine in volume 1." This precious number was secured, and in August 1948 the collection was complete and the ward Relief Society officers had all the volumes bound. Then they supplied the material, and the president's husband, A. Alfred Swenson, built an appropriate cabinet for housing the books. On December 7, 1948, this complete, beautiful, and priceless set of books, arranged in the cabinet, was presented to the Provo Third Ward Relief Society as a Christmas gift. Sister Swenson suggests: "While early Magazines yet exist, may other groups feel the desire to secure a full set for themselves, that this choice material may be preserved as a cherished treasure for generations to come."

Bird is president of Utah Stake Relief Society. 348 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 Photograph submitted by Helen Hassell NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MISSION, ASHLAND (OREGON) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY ASSEMBLES IN NEW CHAPEL FOR OPENING SOCIAL October 1948 Left to right, beginning with the third person, front row: Mary Burrows, district aid; Helen Hassell, President, Ashland Branch Relief Society; Marion Lusk, First This active and enthusiastic branch was organized three years ago with eight members.

Built on the main road which leads to the historic home of Thomas Jefferson, "Monticello," this chapel will stand as a testimony to the divinity of the message of the restored gospel.

"Well," Miss 'Tyndale said, "if you can stand a garrulous old woman a while longer, I'll tell you the story." Miss Tyndale flashed a smile that on anyone else would have been described as cryptic, on her it was half amusement. "One day," she began, "my youngest brother Ned came home from school with a friend. They must have been arguing, for the friend insisted I was going to marty 'T'om Wallcrist." "Who was Tom Wallcrist? I never heard of him," Nan cut in. "Tom Wallcrist was a young man with a plodding gait and a plodding heart, but he had a spark of fire in him." Her smile this time was for some secret memory in her heart. "Ned," she said, taking up the story again, "didn't like the idea of my marrying 'Tom. He came rushing in, all upset. «<7 was in the kitchen, down on my hands and knees scrubbing the floor. 'Jen,' he said, his face tortured, 'you aren't going to marry Tom Wallcrist, are you?' "T didn't know exactly what had gone on, but I guessed. More to comfort him than anything else, I said as I wrung out the mop cloth, 'I wouldn't marry Tom Wallcrist if he was the last man on earth.' "That satisfied him. He rushed out to his friend and said, 'Jen isn't going to marry Tom Wallcrist. She says She wouldn't do it if he was the last man on earth.'" 353 We Recommend These TWO COLLECTIONS for every SINGING MOTHERS Music Library Sacred Choruses—(Hansen) SSA.75 Angels, Ever Bright and Fair—Handel At Eventide, It Shall Be Light—Gaul But the Lord Is Mindful of His Own— Mendelssohn Eye Hath Not Seen—Gaul For Thee, O Dear, Dear Country—Gaul God So Loved the World—Stainer He Shall Feed His Flock—Handel The Holy City—Adams I Will Sing of Thy Great Mercies— Mendelssohn Lift Thine Eyes—Mendelssohn Lord, Bow Thine Ear—Mendelssohn O, Holy Night—Adam Open the Gates of the Temple—Knapp These Are They Which Came—Gaul Fox Library Collection, Vol. I (secular) SSA 85 A Japanese Sunset—Deppen I Love a Little Cottage—O'Hara Indian Dawn—Zamecnik In the Heart of the Hills—Lee Lassie O'Mine—Walt Little Bluebird of My Heart—Grey Love Came Calling—Zamecnik Magnolia Bloom—Bernd Neapolitan Nights—Zamecnik One Fleeting Hour—Lee Out of the Dusk to You—Lee Sometime—Somehow—Somewhere—Wallace The Prayer Perfect—Stenson The Little Old Garden—Hewitt To Sing Awhile—Drummond We specialize in music for L.

UTAH RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 "What happened then?" Nan was breathless with curiosity. "Nothing," Miss' Tyndale said, matter-of-fact. "I was mortified for a minute, then I dismissed it as childish nonsense. You know how everyone talks in a small town. Within an hour I'd completely forgotten it. I didn't even think of it, when a man called me from the gate that evening. "T went out to see, and there was Tom. He was standing stiff as a rod on the other side of the fence. I walked up to him, but before I could get out a 'good evening' he stopped me by saying, "You might have waited until I asked youl' He didn't say another word, just turned his back and walked away." "But didn't he come back?" Nan insisted. "No, he didn't." Miss Tyndale scooped up a last handful of berries, her wrinkled face bland. "He left town right after that. He went out to Colorado and did right well in the cattle business—or so I've heard." "Oh, dear,' Nan's voice was a wail, "it shouldn't have ended that way. You should have gone after him and explained." "What was there to explain?" Miss Tyndale's voice was some eighty years mild. "You should have gone after him anyway," Nan insisted. Miss Tyndale's laugh was free from remorse. "Girls didn't 'go after men' in those days. Anyway, I'd have been too shy to say anything." So that was it! Nan saw it all in swift comprehension. Miss Tyndale had been too shy. I should have known it, Nan told herself. She YOU MIGHT HAVE WAITED wanted to call Winkie and say, | "Look long upon this face. In her you have touched hands with the past." Winkie, she realized, was too young. She could only hope that in the years to come, some remembrance of Miss Tyndale's face, some inflection of her quiet voice, or some fragrance from her garden would remain. With swift compassion, Nan took Miss Tyndale's wrinkled face between her strong young hands and kissed the startled lady on her furrowed cheek. "I'm glad you stayed," she whispered, her voice constricted with emotion. Miss 'Tyndale's usually steady hands were shaking. "I declare," she said, "I didn't know it was so late. You get that child of yours and we'll go in the house for a cookie. "You know," she told Nan as she led the way into the house," I think the view of the valley is even prettier from the living room this time of day."

Boiling water, with dry bread broken in it, and salt and pepper and butter. Christine set the table and turned the chairs facing outward. "Come, Donnie," called Mama. Each knelt by a chair. "Donnie, will you—?" "Dear Heavenly Father, thank thee for this day and..." with Mama's help he finished. "What a nice, close-of-the-day prayer, Donnie," whispered Mama. They sat at the table, eyes lowered, arms folded. "Christine—" ",.. And for this bread we thank thee..." "Amen." ' "Please pass a piece of Christine's cake," ventured Naaman, slyly, recompensed when Christine glared at him. "Well, you cut it like cake, in wedges." "Look at the slices Mama cuts. They're straight," shrilled Donnie. Why did Donnie have to speak so umnecessarily loud, thought Christine, as she looked enviously at the even brown slices Mama had cut. "Maybe it's the knife," said Mama. "Maybe it's tired. It's getting very old, you know. It crossed the plains with Grandma. "Was it an Indian knife, Mama?" Naaman was excited at the thought. "To scalp with?" added Donnie. "Donnie!" Christine looked at him disgustedly. "After all, we're eating!" "Oh, no," Mama put in, "nothing so romantic. Just one from a A PATTERN FOR CHRISTINE hardware store in Kirtland, one of the few not burned by the mobs. Grandpa used to sharpen it out here in the orchard on the old grindstone." "Did you help?" shouted Donnie. "I put drops of water, from a can, on the stone as he ground. But oh, just so much water; not too many drops." "May I be excused, Mama; I'm finished?" asked Donnie. "Certainly, dear." Donnie lay on the floor, one foot in the air. "It feels so good, Mama; it feels so good to have a sliver in your foot." "Christine, dear, will you clear the dishes while I take care of Donnie, please?" "Sure, Mama." Mama filled the washbowl with hot soapy water and put it on a chair beside her rocker. She sat in the rocker and held out her arms. "Come here, Donnie, I have a story to tell you. "A story, goodie!" He limped over and climbed on her lap. "Have you seen Dr. Johnson driying his fine horse and buggy around town?" "With his black bag." supplied Donnie. "Well, Naaman says, some day he is going to be the doctor and drive such a fine horse and buggy." "Me, too," interrupted Donnie, "I'm going to have a bigger buggy; a long square one with fringes, like Brother Nolte's. And a gray, spotted horse. Brother Nolte let me hold the reins and put the buggy whip back in the holder." "Wouldn't you like a fine doctor 357 CG "Satisfaction: (uaranteed SEARS ea ROEBUCK AND CO. Money Back!"

"You can hold it." "Will you play a game with me?" bargained Donnie. "Tf you don't bawl." THE blue twilight slowly claimed the quiet, country town, circled in the sure, close embrace of the hills. The are light on the corner blinked and then flared its pale, morning-glory of light on the wide, dirt road. Children seeped from all the homes in the neighborhood, whooping. "R-uvn, my sheep, run " Christine tingled with delight. It was delicious. It was heaven. A young, brown elbow touched her own in the dusk; patched overalls, in running, brushed her faded apron. The dusk air twined her curls with coolness and washed her with ecstacy.... The curfew tolled across the summer night and the street grew still again. When they went in Mama was ironing Mrs. Boyne's beautiful, embroidered pillowslips. "Oh, Mama, save one for me to iron." "The prettiest, the very prettiest, Pll save for you to iron tomorrow, because you iron so well, Christine. You'll soon be too much competition for me. And now to bed, and don't forget your secret prayers, because that's the way to get the things you need and sometimes even the things you want, if they're right for you to have." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 Mama tucked the sheet over Chnistine and kissed her twice. "Oh, Mama, I love you." "And I love you. It's such fun to have a little girl. Just wait and see,' Mama whispered gaily, and then went back to her ironing.... EK OK OK ¢STUST wait and see "Oh, Mama!' Christine's head fell to her arms on the machine, and all the rest of the bitterness sobbed out of her in a silent prayer. Mama, brave, wonderful, cheerful Mama Christine opened her eyes and sat up. Someone seemed to be near. Cherished words came back to her —oh, not in tones her ears could hear, but in words her heart could understand. It was the remembrance of Mama. Her mother's smile, her words, seemed to return in vividness and beauty. Mama would always be here with her. She would never be alone. Christine sat looking at the summer gold that lay outside, and she felt a deep contentment. She was comforted. She drew her eyes back to the unfinished sewing. The pattern sheet, yes, the pattern, Mama had always said that if the pattern was good, she would be wise to follow it until she grew adept enough to devise her own. Her confident hand patted the folded paper. Tomorrow, she would finish the sewing. She would use the pattern. She heard the scrunch of Dave's anxious, hurried steps on the walk, and caught the sound to her singing heart. The door opened. "Christine, | Christine,. Herm?" Bright with her old smile, she moved into his arms. How's Auerbach's Makes It Easy For You To Knit Yourself A Dress Knitting is an easy and fascinating hobby.
