Abigail picked up the vase and sniffed the roses. "Penny is twenty. She's in love. You married younger." "You know it's not her age. But I won't have her marrying Mark Saunders. I won't let her. I won't!" She stood still, looking at her trembling hands. "You're letting yourself get upset over something you can't help." Joanna lifted her eyes. "You know what it's like to be poor. You've been through the things I've been through. You love Penny. Do you want her to have the life we knew?" Abigail put the roses back on the table. She faced Joanna. "Listen to me, Joanna. I've been poor and now, thanks to you, I'm a well-to-do woman, an' I can't see a speck of difference in my happiness. I was happy with Henry. I've been very happy with your children and you." She came to Joanna and hugged her briefly. "Never will I forget what a perky little thing you were. Rememberin' just this morning how you taught Primary when you were dead on your feet." OANNA kissed the soft, lined forehead. "I was grim and grave in those days took religion seriously." Abigail hesitated. "Did you know that it was on account of you that I went to Church...

That's why I've stayed here when times I was so mad I would have left you in a minute... Like now." "Abigail! You couldn't leave me. What have I done?" Abigail sniffed. "You're being perfectly pigheaded over Mark and Penny. Not taking into account how glad you ought to be that Penny's found a man of her own faith." '"There's all faiths." Abigail turned away. "I guess I should have known you would say that. Of course, there are nice boys of all faiths. But to think that Penny should be so blessed.... Did you know Mark's work is attracting attention back East?' Joanna shrugged. "Abigail, once and for all, I don't care what attention Mark's work gets. I won't have Penny marrying a hand-tomouth artist, and I'm not in the mood to support one myself." Abigail turned heavily toward the kitchen table. She picked up the vase again and carried it into the dining room. Over her shoulder, she asked in last defiance, "How are you going to stop her from marrying him, if she chooses?" Joanna swept off her smart fur hat and let the new fur coat slide from her shoulders. She sank wearily into a kitchen chair and stared out into the garden. 'The willow tree trailed its naked fingers in the snow and the rose bushes bowed under the white burden. Sparrows scolded by the tiny pond. Sally came dancing in from school. Sixteen years old.

She had taken Pe nny's old 750 delightful in the summertime with its wicker furniture. Now it was bleak. The town was hidden under a pall of smoke, but to the west the sun was setting in flaming splendor. She watched David's car come up the street. She smiled, seeing David's hand thrust out when he turned into the driveway, the cautious slowing down, so_ like David, careful, conscientious. No trace in him at all of his gay and reckless father. She went back into her room and changed into a housecoat and stretched wearily on the chaise longue. She heard David's step on the stair and then he knocked at her door. "Come in, David. I've _ been watching you come home." He opened the door and came in. He wore glasses now; they gave his face a scholarly look. But his blond hair was still as rumpled as when he was a little boy. He bent to kiss her and Joanna patted it into place. "What's new?" He pushed her over and sat beside her. "Mom, do you love me?" She grinned at him. "Even though you are a pill I love you still.' The old childhood rhyme brought the slow smile to his mouth. "How would you like it if I ran out on you for a couple of years?" "IT wouldn't." Joanna sat up. "You've just come back." "T've been called on a mission to Great Britain." OANNA sank back. She sighed in relief. "Oh, you frightened me for a moment. Of course, you can't go." "Why not?" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 Something in his voice she had never heard before, a withdrawal, as though she had become a stranger. She took his hand. "I need you, David." "What is it?" Quick alarm and concern in his eyes, and instantly, the old adoring love. "It's Penny " "T know. Has Mark been around to sue for her hand? He told me ge was trying to get up courage." Joanna leaned forward. "I won't have her marry Mark. I won't, I tell you, I won't." "But Mother, Mark's a swell guy, none better." "He's not good enough for Penny. After all the years I've worked and slaved to give her something better than I do. Do you think I'm going to throw her right back into poverty? No. No!' Suddenly she was crying, fiercely, bitterly, the hot tears burning her palms and running down her wnists. "Mother... Mother, please!"' He tried to take her hands away from her face. "T want you to stay home and run the business. I'll take Penny and Michael and Sally ona long long trip. You're the only one I can trust." "T see." He dropped her hands. She lifted her face to him. "You think I'm being cruel and unreasonable, but you don't know what Penny has always meant to me. You know she's not like other girls she's different.... There is so much of loveliness in her." "T know." David turned to face her. "Mother, don't you _ see? Don't you understand about Penny? JOANNA She doesn't need a lot of fancy gadgets around her. She doesn't feed on things like clothes, or jewels, or cars. She is nourished from deeper springs." He stared over Joanna's head. "Once, in March it was, I found her in the garden, holding a twig of willow against her face. She lcoked at me with that shining in her. 'I'm trying to listen to the life inside,' she said, 'the something in this willow that is already alive and racing toward spring, green life, David, coming up through the earth, running through the little green tunnels of this willow.' I said to her, "Well, it sure looks dead on the outside.' She smiled at me, you know that funny little secret smile of hers, and she said, "You just don't know, David.' "' Joanna shook her head. "I know. It sounds just like her. Sounds like her poetry, too. Oh, David, I have such dreams for her. Such a future. I'll take care of her, guard her from every sorrow. She will write things that will make the world sit up and take notice." David sighed heavily. "Oh, Mom, you don't understand. You're trying to keep Penny from life, from beauty. Work and_ struggle are beautiful... Don't you see?" OANNA tose and walked over to her dressing table. "No. I don't see. I can't let my visionary children ruin their lives. I've given too much, sacrificed too much." David rose slowly. "We owe you a great deal, Mother. I've. Never forgotten the way vou had to work when we were small. The winter mornings I would wake up to find you slaving over those ranges." more shining. 751 Joanna turned to face him.. "If you remember those things, David, you will do as I say. You will forget this missionary call for the time being, and you will stay home and watch over things while I take Penny on this trip." David was silent for a long time. Then he lifted his head; his face was quiet. "Something tells me that I am going to have the privilege of going on a mission. So, perhaps it is all might to stay home now A year is not long I can go when you get back." Joanna bent above the silver brushes on her table. "Plenty of time for missions plenty of time." In the mirror she watched him leave the room. He closed the door quietly behind him. Joanna looked at her reflection. She looked unutterably tired. But still her face had not lost its beauty, the silver wings of hair above her temples were becoming, they made the rest of her dark hair seem richer and She had put on weight in the last year, but it had smoothed away the lines that used to run sharply from nose to mouth. She looked brisk, and attractive and competent. She looked as if she would be interesting to know. Worldly, amusing. I'll need clothes, Joanna thought, and went to the closet to take inventory. Suddenly the thought of the people she would meet, the gay, witty, tolerant people, filled her with a frantic: desire to be gone. Pcnnv would. Meet someone devastating, and that would be the end of Mark Saunders. (To be concluded) Fun With Spools Rachel K. Laurgaard Illustrations by Elizabeth Williamson BE": spools are such nice little wooden objects to paint. They are smooth and even in size and just the thing to hold small size candles. Show card colors or oil paints work equally well, and with little effort and lots of fun, you can decorate them to suit the occasion. Hearts and flowers in the Pennsylvania Dutch manner, letters to spell out "Happy Birthday," "Valentine Greetings," "Happy Faster," fancy stripes, or funny faces—you can think up many more. Surround the next birthday cake with a circle of spool candle holders, or use one at each place to hold the place card at your next party. It's fun to use simple things effectively! > November Moon Margaret B.

I bend my knees to ease and follow her As she wends her way upon the ground. But where? I do not see the grasses stir; Listening long, I hear no other sound.

Page 752 You Can Learn PART II C Gs for Clay and D Is for Dirt Katherine Kelly E, were late with supper that night. In fact, we were late every night, unless we ate before Tom did the chores. I was a little silent, too. It didn't seem that I would ever learn. Even Mother said that I was a tomboy. Tom, eight years older than I, liked me to act dignified. Just that night I had forgotten again. I had been so happy when I'd seen him coming home from the fields that, since I was riding Betsy, bringing the cows home from the pasture, I had whirled her around and dashed off through the fields to meet Tom. Then I had jumped from the pony while she was still running, as my brother had taught me to do, and run headlong toward Tom. But the colt he was breaking had snorted, and reared and the team had started to run. Tom, who was a master with horses, had quieted them again in a few minutes. I had taken Betsy's rein and trailed slowly after him to the corral. Tom had been very angry. "Can't you see that you scared the horses and won't you ever learn not to run - that pony through the fields like that? She might have broken her leg," he had stormed at me. I had taken Betsy's bridle off and turned her into the pasture. Then I had leaned against the corral fence while Tom carefully unharnessed and fed the team. At length he had grinned at me and taken my hand as we walked toward the house. I felt penitent. Only this afternoon I had vowed that I would be a good farmer's wife. * * * "Let me help you milk tonight. I can milk, honest I can, I used to milk the little Jersey all the time at home." "That was different. I don't want my wife milking cows. You'll have enough to do in the house. Boy, does that fresh bread smell good!" he said as we opened the door and went into the house. I was happy again as I got out the wood alcohol to light the lamps and he took the milk buckets and went out again. We were very proud of those lights. They were gasoline lights and we had to warm them up with a wood alcohol torch, so it wasn't like just turning a button. But it was a sort of ritual with me and, when the lights came on so bright and beautiful, they were such a satisfaction. Brighter than electricity, we always said. They hung from the ceiling, too, and had a round glass bulb. Most farmers just had coal-oil lamps. As the room flooded with light, I looked proudly about the kitchen. The new plaster was smooth and white. It really didn't need kalsomine. The new white paint gleamed beautifully without a flyspeck as yet, and the blue in the oilcloth we Page 753 754 had put on that afternoon really complemented the bluebirds I had painted on the filmy, new curtains. I carefully shut the doors into the bedroom and the living room. We didn't have the money for paper and paint for them yet, but it wouldn't be long. Not many newly matried couples could build a brand new three-room house on a farm. It was stucco on the outside and I could just see how it would look with pink roses on a white trellis by the porch. Tom had thought that maybe two rooms would do because we would be moving into town in a few years. But I told him stoutly that I didn't want to move into town, that people who made their home on the farm where they could take care of things, always did better and I wanted a house that could be a home. As I set the table for supper I thought again about jumping off that horse and acting so unladylike. I was always too impulsive and careless. Well, I wouldn't do that again. Maybe Tom would rather I just stood framed in the doorway, the lamplight making a halo around my head like I had seen pictures of women waiting for their men. 'That's what I would do after this. WHILE we ate supper I told Tom about Daisy eating the little tree and how I had bandaged it up with mud. Tom was tired, but he smiled and teased, "Do you think that will help it?" "Well, sure, it will make it grow just like new. Mary thinks so, too." I knew that he would value Mary's opinion as he did her cooking. He had lived in his sister RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 Mary's home for so long that he practically worshiped her. "And, honey, do you know what I was thinking today?" I decided to break the subject gently as I hauled in the sick lamb, box and all, and prepared to feed it some of the warm milk. "No, I'd never know what you were thinking of next, what is it this time?" "T was thinking that I could plant some lawn, just a little lawn, out in front here and when that tree is big we could sit out on the lawn in the shade." "Now, Kate, sweetheart, please don't get all those funny ideas. You just build yourself a heartache. You know we don't get the water turn often enough to keep a lawn alive. And you couldn't even get one to come up on this darned clay spot." "What do you mean clay spot?" I asked absently as I picked a few ticks off the lamb and put them carefully in the stove. "I think I'll spray this poor lamb with some fly spray. The ticks are eating it alive." "You know we built the house on a clay spot, don't you? This ground is just like that I hauled the straw manure on over by the south fence. It won't raise anything for years." "But—but why then did you build the house here? It is too close to Joe's fence anyway, or you could have built up nearer the road." "Dad said this was the place to build. 'Just as well put your house here, can't raise anything anyway, that's just what he said." "But I should think you would want your house where you could raise things best. I want currant YOU CAN LEARN and raspberry bushes, a garden, and flowers and everything." "My dear, that's the kind of farms they have in books. This is a real farm. This heavy clay soil won't raise flowers anywhere, much less on this clay spot. You'll find out about this soil before you have lived here much longer. Now I'm tired and am going to bed, coming?" "In a minute. I've got to think. And I want to wash the dishes." walked out onto the porch and on out into the moonlight. So this ground wouldn't raise lawn and flowers, and we only got the water every ten days! People who built their houses on clay spots so they wouldn't waste any good farming ground! I all but frothed at the mouth as I walked up and down in the moonlight. Still none of the other farmers around us had lawn and flowers. Maybe they couldn't have them. Some of them didn't even have trees. Well, I couldn't live that way. I'd change this soil! And Id have a rose growing there by that porch if I had to water it with dishwater. No, the pigs had to have the dishwater. I'd water it with water from the washbasin. And some way I'd have a lawn, too. A pheasant call sounded lonely from the fields and suddenly the spung night felt chill. I was glad to go back into the warm kitchen, dip some of the precious water into a pan, and wash the dishes. I dallied a little, putting the dishes away on the newly painted shelves. Then I took a chair and climbed up and turned out the bright gas light. Softly I opened the bedroom door. 755 Next morning I was up bright and early, but Tom was up earlier and was out milking the cows. I went first to the box behind the stove to see how the lamb had fared during the night. It lay all stretched out, and at first I thought it was dead. Just then it gave a faint bleat and struggled to get up. I ran as fast as I could go to the corral. "Tom," I yelled, "that lamb is worse, I think it is going to die. What can I do?" The cow was startled and nearly upset the milk bucket. Tom patiently moved his stool and started milking again. "Let it die, I guess. It probably will anyway," he said. "But if you want to monkey with it, Joe says castor oil sometimes helps. Marty has some if you want to try it." I was on my way before he had stopped speaking. Joe was watering the lucern field which lay between our house and theirs but, fast as | was going, I took the ditches which crossed the path in my stride and scarcely saw them. Marty was cooking breakfast, She left the stove and found the castor oil among the many bottles in her medicine cabinet. She held the bottle up to the light and shook it. "Yes, there is plenty here. You won't need more than a couple of teaspoonfuls. Don't you want a hot biscuit?" "Oh, no, thanks, I'm in a hurry. Thanks a lot." And I was gone again as fast as I could run. I jumped the ditches as I ran just as I had done on the way over, but I must have stepped too close to the edge of one. Down JI went, my foot sinking deep in the mud and 756 throwing me forward with a splash. I caught myself with one hand and held the castor oil high with the other. But the more I tried to pull my feet out of the mud the farther in I sank. The mud itself just seemed to be pulling me deeper and deeper. "Tom," I called, "Tom!" He was just coming to the house with the milk. He put the buckets carefully on the back porch and walked leisurely around to the front and started putting on his big boots. There was a big grin on his face. Maybe I did look funny, but it was no joke. 'The more I floundered the deeper in I went. I would probably be clear to China before he got there. ""I'om, come and help! Can't RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 you see I am sinking deeper and deeper!" "What did I tell you?" he said as he came toward me in his big boots. "Just like quicksand this soil when it's wet and just like a brick when it's dry. Maybe you'll believe what I said about this ground now." He pulled me out and carried me the rest of the way home. Me with the bottle of castor oil held high and mud clear to my waist. "Still want to raise flowers?" he teased as he set me safely on the porch. Of course I wanted to raise flowers, what did that have to do with falling in the mud! November Day Beatrice K. Ekman A cold day, a gray day, Wind and rain and sleet; Sullen clouds that do not break, Shroud-mist on the wet, paved street. The rain drips from the shingle eaves In dreary monotone; With gusty force against the pane, A leafless branch is blown. The sodden leaves cling to the grass, Bare trees loom stark above... I kindle fire in my heart... In memory of my love. —_- Pioneer Recipe Anna Prince Redd I remember a very old and a very respected, early pioneer of Panguitch, Utah. She lived alone in a log-room home on the edge of town. Every day at exactly four P. M. A townswoman, taking her turn, would arrive (or her child would) at the cabin with a hot dinner for 'Aunt Mariar," as she was fondly called. One day when it was my mother's turn, she fixed the tray and sent me to deliver it. "Tell Aunt Mariar,'"' Mother said, "that I didn't have any eggs to make a cake today, but I'll make one tomorrow and send her two pieces. And be sure to tell her before you uncover the tray, or she'll be offended and won't eat any dinner. She loves cake."' Standing just beyond ''Aunt Mariar's" exactly. Reaching hands, I delivered the message, Still living in her days of pioneer hardship, she leaned forward and cried out in a high-pitched voice: "Land sakes, child, you don't need eggs to make a cakel Just tell your Ma to add a little more soda to give it that yellow cast."

Be that as it may, it is a vegetable to me and always will be. I wouldn't think of arranging a nice basket of fruit and putting a tomato right in the middle of it. In fact, I think the tomato would feel very uncomfortable. And now I'm going to tell how this article came to be written. I was invited by the Park Stake Relief Society board to represent the general board at a luncheon at the Lion House given in honor of the ward presidencies and secretaries of Relief Society in Park Stake. HE long tables were decorated in vegetables, and so well had the hostesses, under the able direction of Sister Janet Kirton of the stake board, caught the beauty and interest, as well as the humor, which vegetables afford, that it was one of the most unusual table decorations Simmons Photo Art Studio THREE ONION-HEADED MEN IN A BANANA-SQUASH BOAT RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 I have ever seen. Right then I received permission to share this idea with other Relief Society members. Asked where they got the idea, they said they had heard of such a table and had seen some pictures, but as they worked it out, innumerable ideas came to them. I shall describe as many as possible and hope you will try at least some of them, for such a table certainly puts your guests in a jovial mood the minute they see it. No doubt you will think of other unusual combinations according to the particular vegetables you have at hand. Through the courtesy of Sister Ruby Karpowitz, President of Park Stake Relief Society, we are printing a picture of the decoration that centered the main table. For the background effect some unique branches dipped in harmonizing Shades of bright paint in fall colors were used. (See article in the June Relief Society Magazine by A. J. Neff as to how to obtain and treat these odd-shaped pieces.) Cattails were added in the background and autumn leaves in the foreground of the arrangement. 'The place cards were small green tomatoes with a slit in the top to hold the card. The vegetables used, reading from left to right were as follows: A washer-woman whose head was a small onion, eyes were cloves, nose and mouth bits of finger peppers. Her cap was half of a red pepper, arms of string beans, bodice a whole red pepper with an acorn squash as her skirt. The wash tub was a tiny summer squash supported on tooth picks and the washboard was a piece of cardboard. That queer looking bird that comes next was a crooked-necked squash with fancy buttons for eyes. There were half THE INTEREST AND BEAUTY OF VEGETABLES Simmons Photo Art Studio 159 A VEGETABLE FAMILY DECORATES THE TABLE a dozen other smaller birds, whose eyes were made of corsage pins, and identical with the first one, all of which were made from the same crooked-necked squash which come in a deep orange color. In front of the birds was a nest of heavy grasses holding their make-believe eggs. The toadstools were summer squash, their stems being cardboard covered with fancy paper. The boat in the picture was a good sized one made of half a banana squash. The rowers were made with carrot bodies, onion heads with clove eyes, and arms of beans. The oars were straws and the sails corn husks. Another quaint woman's figure had an onion head, summer squash bodice, acorn squash skirt, string bean arms, and a parasol made of half of a small green tomato, supported by a piece of macaroni for the handle. Other figures not shown in the picture were smaller boats made of scooped out cucumbers. In_ this case the rowers' bodies were made of radishes with tiny onions for heads, and string bean arms. A sweet potato made a realistic fish, and queer-shaped Irish potatoes represented covered wagons. A realistic wheelbarrow had been cut from a green pepper, with carrot slices for wheels. 'Then there was a somewhat grotesque head made from an eggplant with Swiss chard turban (held in place with toothpicks), onion eyes, red finger-pepper nose, and corn kernels for teeth, placed in the slit cut for the mouth. I only hope that my readers will try out some of these ideas for their family gatherings on Thanksgiving day. The children will be especially pleased. 760 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 The Loving Friend of Children (Continued from page 729) take our baby any more, but often came in to caress her and play with her (Ibid., page 67). We are able to fix the approximate date of the above incidents by reading Joseph's history. There we learn that his infant son, Don Carlos, died at Nauvoo in August 1841. I shall close this article with a brief statement by Bathsheba W. Smith, wife of George A. Smith, the Prophet's cousin, who was well acquainted with the Prophet Joseph Smith in Nauvoo. Regarding him she states: In Nauvoo, at his home, while playing with my baby boy, he said that children were the "honor, glory and royal diadem of woman!" <> I Saw Paricutin (Continued from page 741) We wound our way through the hills built of ashes, over the sawtooth lava ridges and then past the skeleton trees. As I slid and bobbed up and down, according to the terrain over which we passed, the grotesque, ghostlike figures with distorted bodies and twisted arms, assumed the mocking motions of my jolting and swaying body. Wearily I closed my eyes only to hear the weird incantations of their smothered young souls. Incredible! I called to Salvadore, "Are you there, Salvadore?" In a calm voice and from a short distance, he answered, "Si, si, Senora, I am here." Closing my eyes again I now recognized the muchacho's low, minor tones. We stumbled on, arriving at San Juan de las Colchas and our waiting pony owners. While I was being helped down, the little guide extended his hand and in the only English 'word he ever uttered, he said, "Teep?" He clenched the proffered "teep" in his tiny fist and fleetly ran to his father. Apparently the parent was pleased for he said "bueno" to the lad. Wearily I entered the waiting car. The others followed. We settled down for the arduous return journey, but no one spoke. All of us were completely spent from having witnessed the Great Mother's magnificent travail.

Ancient Rites at a Modern Wedding (Continued from page 737) men came in and sat on the other. Under no circumstances do they sit together. Even the bride and groom sat On opposite sides. The church was quite plain, having no elaborate statues or paintings. The walls were sparkling white, with only a border of yellow and black design, in the village motif used on the costumes. The ceremony began with a strange, but delightful religious chanting, after which the minister stood and called for the couple to stand before him. He gave a lovely sermon to them on the meaning and holiness of marriage. The actual ceremony was very simple, with the bride and groom answering only "With the help of God, I will," when the minister asked the question of love, honor, and obey. After that, the two went to their separate places again until the end of the service. Only after the service, and out in the street, did the two walk together in a procession to the home of the bride for feasting. We went back to the home of the groom's parents, where we feasted along with the rest. There was so much food that we just couldn't eat all they offered us. These delightful country folk still eat in the same tradition of hundreds of years ago. The table was set with a series of large bowls in the center of the table. Each person had his own spoon and they all ate from the common bowl. It was new and very interesting to watch, because they were gracious and courteous about it all. Each took his spoonful 'as he wanted, and when the bowl became empty it was soon filled with more of the same until the next course. They sat at the table almost all afternoon, eating and feasting. At about four in the afternoon a new ceremony took place at the home of the bride. The groom now took advantage of his rights, and asked the bride's parents if he might take her to his home to live with his family. The parents agreed and gave their blessing, but were very sad at the parting. The gitl took leave of her parents and, with her, she took her dowry, which consisted of a whole wagon load of feather beds and pillows. The wedding guests all accompanied them "home." On the way, they were stopped by a villager who had stretched a chain across the road. Many villagers were gathered at this spot to watch the fun and join in the merriment. This man stopped the wedding party, told the couple of their folly, and tried to bargain with them for the pillows. He was finally defeated in his attempts to make them unhappy, and so was satisfied when they paid him a few crowns in tax to go on. The couple entered the home of the groom, and the bride went immediately to his parents, and asked them if they would accept her into the family as one of their daughters. This was a very touching ceremony, and tears of joy were shed as she was welcomed and blessed by the head of the household. Thus being accepted, the feather beds were moved into the house by the maidPage 761 762 ens in the group. The feasting continued until midnight at which time the bride discarded her maiden's headdress, and donned one of a matron. The wedding cake was brought in at this time. It was a colorful one with a hole in the middle. This was passed around and all present put money into the hollow cake, and each said something like this: "I bequeath you this money that you may remember to be a good and careful mother to your children." Others gave money for the cradle, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 others gave some to help buy a first animal for their flocks and so on. The celebration and feasting lasted for three days and, all the while, the villagers helped with the cooking, with the chores in the fields, and with the cattle and flocks so that no time was lost by those celebrating. It was a real example of brotherhood, love, and cooperation. The whole world could gain a lesson by observing this good, simple, God-fearing people who love their neighbors as themselves. > A Letter from Mother M* Dear Children: How are you, darlings?

(I have acquired the habit of closing each day by reading a few verses from Church books.) The other evening, I turned to the 58th section of the Doctrine and Covenants and happened upon the words: "For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant." I read on until I fairly squirmed—you know how I prefer listening from the back row. After I turned out the lights, I thought of what I had read. I concluded that listening was all right in its place, but if the Lord expected us to act on our own initiative, seeking ways to help in his cause, I ought to see what I could do. I decided to offer to do typing or other detail office work for the bishopric, which would free them for more important duties. I felt ashamed that I had not seen the need before. Anyway, it seems to me that anything we do to help in the Lord's work really helps us. So, darlings, why not read that section and see if it affects you similarly? Suddenly it is quite late, and I must close. Dearest love to my grandchildren— and grand children. Mother CLARA HORNE PARK (Note: Mrs. Park, who lives in Salt Lake City, is the daughter of Richard S.

IER DEPARTMENT a c" Sheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 21—"On to Jerusalem" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 29, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, February 7, 1950 Objective: To show how steadfastly Jesus continued to minister unto people on his road to foreknown Calvary and the cross. Jesus Again Foretells His Death and Resurrection ACH of the three synoptic writers gives a fairly detailed description of the events during the last journey to Jerusalem. The apostles noticed how sad and deeply affected Jesus was and fell behind him in amazement. They seemed not to understand his plain affirmation that he would be delivered to the Gentiles who "shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again" (Luke 18:33). It was all inconsistent to them. They knew he was the Christ—the Lord Omnipotent— and could not realize he would be brought into subjection and slain. They particularly could not understand his prediction that in three days he would be resurrected. The Question of Precedence Again During this solemn and never-tobe-forgotten trip the human side of some of the twelve asserted itself. Jesus had diligently labored to teach them that service was the true measure of greatness, and yet two of them—James and John—the sons of Zebedee—made the request that they be given seats of eminence. This request was to be realized when Jesus came into possession of his kingdom. Matthew records that the request first came from their mother, who was probably the Savior's aunt. (See note 1, end of chapter 29 of the text.) Jesus gave them an impressive lesson and told them plainly that the granting of such a request was the prerogative of his Father (Mark 10:35-45). They needed, as we all do, to learn this lesson: '""For even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister" (Matt. 20:28). Sight Restored to the Blind Near Jericho As Jesus was leaving Jericho to walk the last fifteen miles of his journey, a blind man asking for alms heard the tramp of the great multitude which was following, and was told "that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by." 'The blind beggar cried: "Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me." 'The title "Son of David" had peculiar significance. It was the salutation given to Joseph Page 769 770 by the angel at the time the birth of Jesus was announced to that good man. It meant of royal lineage (Matt. 1:20). It proves that the blind man knew of Jesus and had faith in him. Some tried to silence the man but he called the louder. Jesus directed that the man be brought to him. After a brief conversation the Lord said unto him: "Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee." Wondrous words of power and faith! The man was healed. With a heart full of gratitude he glorified God in prayers of thanksgiving (Luke 18:35-43). Zaccheus, the Chief Among the Publicans At Jericho another event occurred, which is worthy of note. The Roman government maintained at this city a staff of collectors of customs, commonly called "publicans." Chief of these was a Jew named Zaccheus. He had "grown rich" by collecting customs and was unpopular, as were all publicans. He had already been impressed by the teachings of the noted Galilean and had a great desire to see him. Zaccheus was a small man and could not ordinarily see over the heads of others. So when he knew that Jesus was coming, he ran ahead of the other people and climbed a tree by the side of the road that he might have a better view. When Jesus reached the place, he spoke to the man in the tree: "Zaccheus, make haste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house." However, the multitude criticized Jesus, saying that he "was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner." Zaccheus did not deny the charge but, after RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 he was converted, offered to make restitution if it was found that he owed any man. He vowed to give "half of his goods" to the poor and to restore fourfold anything he had taken wrongfully. Jesus accepted the man's repentance. Another wayward son had returned. 'The Lord had come to save sinners; to bring joy to the repentant soul (Luke 19:1-10). Unto Every One That Hath Shall Be Given As Jesus neared Jerusalem, he gave to his followers, who were expecting him to proclaim his royal authority, the Parable of the Pounds. (Read Luke 19:11-27.) The story portrayed a recent incident in Jewish history. (See note 3 at end of chapter 29 of the text.) The Lord used the incident as a basis on which to give the account of the three servants to whom had been entrusted the use of a varying number of pounds and how each had used the money. It is quite apparent that Jesus was the nobleman, invested with the authority of kingship. He is to return and demand an accounting from his trusted servants. When he does return he will also punish the citizens who rebelled against him. In the House of Simon the Leper The Savior approached Jerusalem a few days before the killing of the lambs which were eaten at the time of the Passover. 'This was the great annual feast of the Jews. It commemorated the sparing of the Hebrews in Egypt when God smote the first-born of the Egyptians (Ex. 1:1-22). That year the festival LESSON DEPARTMENT probably began on Thursday. Jesus reached Bethany near Jerusalem on the end of the Jewish Sabbath. Jesus knew that it was his last Sabbath on earth and he chose to spend it with those he loved. Out of reverence, the writers do not tell of the happenings of that day. It was probably in the evening after the Sabbath had passed that a supper was given for Jesus and the twelve at the home of Simon the leper. Undoubtedly this man had been cured. Some wniters assume that the house was the family home of Lazarus and Martha and Mary. Simon may have been: their father, but of that there is no proof. Martha evidently had charge of the supper and Mary and Lazarus were there. In fact, Lazarus had been marked for death by the chief A Perry Picture 77 priests because of the interest following his restoration to life. Mary had brought to the gathering a sealed flask containing a pound of costly spikenard ointment. It was very fragrant and is said to have had a value of about forty-five dollars. When Mary had used this precious ointment to anoint the head and feet of the Lord, Judas Iscariot, treasurer of the twelve, and others, protested against such extravagance. Judas was dishonest and hypocritical and asked why the ointment was not sold and the money given to the poor. By way of solemn instructions Jesus said: For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel From a Painting by Plockhorst CHRIST'S ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM 772 shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her (Matt. 26:11-13). How true were these words! Christ's Triumphal Entry Into Jerusalem The next day after the eventful supper, Jesus told two of his disciples to go to a certain place and they would find an ass tied and with her a colt on which no man had ridden. The disciples found the animals as directed and when they had brought the colt, and spread their coats on his back, Jesus was lifted on to the young animal. The Master rode toward Jerusalem. When the group arrived the city was thronged, although it was four days before the great festival. The common people were interested in every movement of the Savior and there was gteat rejoicing when he appeared on the outskirts of the city. The people threw palm leaves and flowers before him and even spread their garments on the streets before him. 'Truly they were carpeting the way for a King. They shouted, among other glad calls: "Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest" (Matt. 21:9). Amid all the rejoicing Jesus was sad. When he saw Jerusalem and the temple of the Lord, he wept and prophesied of the destruction of both. When he rode into the capital, the people were thrilled. The uninformed cried, "Who is this?" And the multitude shouted "This is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee" (Matt. 21:10-11). The Pharisees and chief priests RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 resented bitterly the honor being shown the Lord. "The purpose of Christ in thus yielding Himself for the day to the desires of the people and accepting their homage with kingly grace may not be fully comprehended by us of finite mind." The Roman officials seemed to treat it with indulgent unconcern. When Jesus dismounted and entered the temple enclosure the people continued to shout his praises. Truly, the Prince of Peace had entered the city and temple as befitted a king of Israel. His coming fulfilled prophecy (Zech. 9:9). Certain Greeks Visit Christ During practically all of the Savior's ministry he worked among the Jews. However, people of many nations came to Jerusalem at the time of the annual Passover. Some of these, though not of Jewish descent, had been converted to Judaism. Among these people were certain Greeks who desired to talk with Jesus. They did not think it proper to approach the Master directly, so went first to Philip, one of the apostles. Philip consulted with Andrew, and the two informed Jesus that the foreign visitors sought an interview with him. Jesus bore testimony to these men that the hour of his death was near. They were surprised at his words, and he explained that it was necessary for him to make this sacrifice. (See John 12:20-28.) Those who really love the Lord will give their lives, if necessary, for his sake. Let us at least live for him. The Voice From Heaven The sinful condition of the world and the terrible experiences through LESSON DEPARTMENT which he was about to pass, weighed heavily upon the Lord's soul. In anguish he groaned: "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?" A mighty soul arose to meet an issue of transcendent importance. He prayed: "Father, glorify thy name." To that prayer came an answer: "Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again." (Read John 12:27-36 and John 14:27-31.) "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you" (John 14:27). " And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6). Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. What peculiarly human request did 773 two of the apostles make of Jesus during his last journey to Jerusalem? What great _ lesson can we learn from his answer to them? 2. Relate the event of the healing of the blind at Jericho. Show that the blind beggar really appreciated the blessing. 3. Tell of the circumstances leading to the conversion of Zaccheus. What is the evidence of true conversion? 4. Is repentance complete without trestitution, where restitution is possible? 5. Why do you think Mary was justified in anointing Jesus with the costly spikenard? References in the Four Gospels Matt. 8:28; 16:21; 17:22, 23; 20:17-34; 2121-11; 25:14-30; 26:6-13.

Et Visiting Seacher Tlessages—Our Savior Speaks Lesson 5—"Is Not the Life More Than Meat, and the Body Than Raiment?" (Matt. 6:25) Mary Grant Judd For Tuesday, February 7, 1950 Objective: To emphasize that there is a larger life than that of the body, namely that of the spirit. HEN, in the course of the Sermon on the Mount, Christ presented the question "Is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment?" (Matt 6:25) to his listeners, he was, undoubtedly, not objecting to man's striving for the requirements necessary to physical well-being. The decree to Adam that "in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread' has come down through the ages. It was valid in the time of our Savior; it holds good today. A cardinal principle of the present Church Welfare Plan confirms the dignity of work and points out that individuals, insofar as possible, should labor for their own 774 sustenance. For, as the proverb says: "in all labor there is profit" (Prov. 14:23). When Christ asked "Is not the life more than meat?" he was pointing out that, while it is necessary to provide for our daily reeds, we must not stop there, but go on from the life of the body to the larger life of the spirit. How many people do you know who are content to spend their time "getting and spending," as the poet Wordsworth termed it, with little thought for those larger values of life which are so much more important than mere living from day to day? When he declared the body more than raiment, Christ was warning against the identification of self with material things. How easy it is to feel superior because we have acquired worldly wealth. When we don fine wearing apparel, we move RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 with greater confidence and ease among our friends. As we speed down the street in a new car is our egotism heightened to note the admiring glances of our neighbors? When one builds a large home and furnishes it beautifully, is this, partly at least, to impress those who view it? Yet, in the final analysis, how unimportant these material things are. For, as we well understand, when we leave this life, we can take with us only the sum total of the good we have accomplished and the knowledge we have acquired. And so it is right and proper that Jesus should tell us to put greater emphasis on spiritual, rather than on material values. "Seek ye first," he says, "the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these [physical things] shall be added unto you" (Matt. 6:33). <-> Work IT leeting—Sewing Children's Clothing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 5—Girls' Clothing Jean Ridges Jennings For Tuesday, February 14, 1950 T'S fun to make clothes for girls. There are so many lovely materials and clever styles from which to choose. Here's a place where you can exercise your hidden talents and ambitions as a designer by using onginality and individuality. Here, too, is much opportunity for fine handwork and dainty trimmings. In the opening lesson we talked of choosing becoming and appropriate styles and materials. 'This, of course, is most important. For small tots it is also vital that clothes be launderable. There are so many attractive and dressy materials available from which to make little party dresses that can be freshened as often as need be by washing, that it seems unwise to make clothes that LESSON DEPARTMENT can't be laundered for children. Dainty dotted Swiss, organdie, or the fine silky cottons in pastel shades can be made into dainty frocks that are as lovely as any taffetas or other silks and have the advantage of being tubbable. Thus they can be worn oftener and with less worry and expense for upkeep. While children's clothes should be made roomy enough to allow free movement, they should fit Properly when new. If too much room is allowed for growth, they may be old and shabby before the child grows into them. When making girls' dresses, have them fit well when made, allowing a generous hem to be let down as the child gtows taller. A wide hem looks well and gives body to the skirt and is one Place where a dress can be readily adjusted for size. Make dresses wel] and finish them neatly.

Jacobs Lesson 5—Sir Francis Bacon For Tuesday, February 21, 1950 A we have already pointed out in our discussions of Shakespeare and the King James Bible, the age of Flizabeth has never been surpassed, neither in the fresh vigor which it stamped upon every phase of English life, mor in the correspondingly rich literature which inevitably the Flizabethans wrote to record the lavish flowering of the spirit which was theirs. After having been enslaved throughout Europe during the dark centuries of supervised ignorance and the smothering dogmas of church and state, men's wills and emotions and intellects suddenly awakened and arose as One. Magnificently, these pent-up powers defied the traditional absolutes of politics and religion to continue to break their spits which, for ages, had been withered, crooked, and starved. Magnificently, these sons of the Renaissance, Or Te awakening, gave to their fellows throughout all time the great vision of men exercising wills that are free, emotions that are pure and honest, and intellects determined to give man dominion over the natural world which he had always misunderstood and hence always feared. And of those who dreamed most nobly of man's raising himself to his destined realm of light by reaching down and lifting himself by his own intellectual bootstraps, Jet the name of Francis Bacon be first. Son of the lord keeper of the great seal of Queen Elizabeth, Bacon was reared amid court influences. After studying at Cambridge, he first served his government at age fifteen 'n the English embassy in France. Upon completing three years service he returned home intensely ampitious for political advancement. Unable to impress Queen Elizabeth favorably, he studied law at Gray's Inn and soon thereafter became 4 member of Parliament and advisor to the Queen. When James I be came King, Bacon was knighted. Almost at once it became apparent that the new monarch, weak-willed and amateur scholar that he was, found in Bacon's flattery and intellectual genius much to be rewarded. Bacon was elevated to AttorneyGeneral, and finally became Chancellor of England; he was also made Baron Verulam and Viscount of St. Albans. Yet, despite this whirlwind rise to political and social eminence, he felt that his true carect had scarcely begun. And so it had, for always he regarded his political achievements merely as useful tools to assist him in realizing his heart's desire: the writing and publication of a systematic definition and atrangement of all human knowledge and truth. This was a project unrivalled in its ambition and magnitude by any man since Aristotle (384-322 B. C.). In 1586, at the age of twenty-five, LESSON DEPARTMENT Bacon first defined this great idea and dedicated his life to its achievement. 'Ten years later he pointed out to his kinsman, Lord Burleigh, that his civil goals were but moderate when compared to his contemplative goals, since in the realm of the intellect he had "taken all knowledge" to be his province. Seven years later, in 1603, he wrote that he had found himself "fitted for nothing so well as for the study of Truth." It was Bacon's resulting philosophical writings which, in Macaulay's phrase, "moved the intellects which moved the world." All his important philosophical works were but segments of his Magna Instauratio, or great renewal of scientific and intellectual knowledge. It was in these writings, particularly his Advancement of Learning and Novum Organum, or new principles, that Bacon "announced that Europe had come of age." Here, for the first time, in the works of this first great English philosopher, we have expressed the tone and principles of the same modern science which has done so much to conquer the natural world in which we live. Here, not because of any scientific techniques or discoveries, but because of his revolutionary ideas as to what science should be and how it should be used, we read the words which made Bacon the father of modern science. Most of all Bacon believed in human reason. Disregarding tradition, he hoped to shatter the influence of the past and to aid man in conquering the realm of nature by using his own intellect. Significant is one of his favorite sayings, 777 "Knowledge is power." A new and vital part of his credo was that knowledge should not be sought merely to entertain the speculative medieval scholar; instead scientists should seek out the secrets of nature in order that new discoveries might be used at once to control and overpower nature. Let us learn the laws of nature, and we shall be her masters, as we are now, in ignorance, her thralls; science is the road to Utopia. (Advancement of Learning, iv, 2) But before science could be trusted so completely, Bacon had to tredefine the methods science should use in the search for truth. In place of the deductive logic of Aristotle, which had entirely dominated the scholarship of the Middle Ages, Bacon preached fervently that the method of science must be inductive. Instead of reasoning from one or two facts or premises to prove a third unknown, Bacon, as does the modern scientist, believed that one can arrive at a general truth only after a mass of general fact has been assembled and most carefully examined. With the method of science thus defined, Bacon was ready to point out another reason why the sciences had made but little progress. It is not possible to run a course aright when the goal itself has not been rightly placed. Now the true and lawful goal of the sciences is none other than this: that human life be endowed with new discoveries and powers. (Novum Organum, I, Ixxxi) The supreme conviction of Bacon's life was that by using reason 778 and the scientific method, man js best capable of subduing the world about him. Men are not animals erect, but immortal gods. The Creator has given us souls equal to all the world, and yet satiable not even with a world... - Everything is possible to man. Time ls young; give us some little centuries, and we shall control and remake all things. Bacon hoped first to "seat the sciences each in its proper place" (Advancement of Learning, iv, 2), next to develop the inductive scien. Tific method for defining the forces of nature, and finally to evaluate all nature by using such a procedure. In the prophetic New Atlantis, fictional treatment of his Utopia which was left unfinished at his death, Bacon presented his ideal method for achieving his goals: he visualized a society of learned scholars called Solomon's House, or the College of the Six Days' Work, who cach twelve years were to be sent throughout the world by their wise king to "maintain a trade, not for gold, silver, or jewels... But only for God's first creature, which was light: to have light, I say, of the growth of all parts of the world." (See Text, pp. 562-3, line 4o ff.) That he spoke for the intellectual leaders of England was proved in 1662 when, thirty-five years after the New Atlantis was published, the Royal Society was founded. This Was a group of the best scientists umited in the common cause of Searching out the truths of natural history in precisely the same manner as Bacon's scholars in Solomon's House would have done. Surely there could be no greater tribute to the intellectual zeal and scientific RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 pioneering which then, as now, characterized Bacon _ before the world. It is unfortunately true that some of our great men understood wisdom with their heads but not with their hearts and wills, Of this truth Sir Francis Bacon is the traditional example. "They that take the sword shall perish with the sword" (Matthew 26:52). Although Bacon professed membership in the Church of England, was interested in church reform, and wrote several] beautiful prayers for his Own use, pumarily he loved the intellect alone. Bacon served learning and the learned; but his accusation of his friend Essex in order to obtain favor with Queen Elizabeth; his confession of having accepted bribes when in high office without the ability to express remorse or sense of guilt for the tragedy of his sin; his selfrighteousness; and_ his continued ability to sacrifice personal connections and, in part, his own integrity whenever he felt such action would please the sovereign and his own ambition—all seem to give evidence that he failed to honor the emotional and spiritual aspects of himself and his fellow men, a failure which finally betrayed Bacon himself. | In 1621, after confessing his guilt In accepting bribes, Bacon was deprived of the Great Seal, fined forty thousand pounds, relieved of al] public office, and sentenced to the Tower of London, from which he was released by the King after four days. During the last five years of his life he lived in retirement, writing the major portion of his enduring contributions to science and LESSON DEPARTMENT Philosophy, More than any other worked over hi Intellectya] Tesourc man, he Opened the door 'to oy €s, never discarding he g d, never Modern scientific orld; his Essa Permitting the hazy, 2Y words to will a Ways represent English Prose stan a result Essays are at its be Yet, we might 48T€e famous for their brillian C; rarely has that Alexander Pope was Neither pros said so much IN so little Space entirely Nght nor ntirely wrong Here Is the co densed Intellect of When he €scribed Sir Francis Ba.

'The truths which they tell about things as they are, often wittily expressed in a condensed, near-staccato style, blend together in these essays to become reading which will be fresh and rewarding as long as men are human. As we read from Novum Organum (Text, pp. 560-561) of the four idols which beset the human mind, we realize that Bacon knows people and their foolish weaknesses. 'The following epigram, taken from "Of Sedition and Troubles" (not in our text) also reveals his wit and wisdom, and knowledge of things as they are: Money is like muck, not good unless it be spread. The twelve essays in our text abound in such memorable lines. Some of the best known are: Certainly virtue is like precious odors, most fragrant when they are incensed or crushed: for prosperity doth best discover vice; but adversity doth best discover virtue. ("Of Adversity'' ) Choose the best; habit will make it pleasant and easy. ("Of Parents and Children' ) He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief. ("Of Marriage and Single Life'') It is a strange desire, to seek power and to love liberty; or to seek power over others and to lose power over a man's self. ("Of Great Place" ) Certainly, men in great fortunes are strangers to themselves, and while they RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 are in the puzzle of business they have no time to tend their health, either of body or mind. ("Of Great Place') For good thoughts (though God accept them) yet towards men are little better than good dreams, except they be put in act. ("Of Great Place") After a time, set before thee thine own example; and examine thyself strictly, whether thou didst not best at first. ("Of Great Place') And certainly it is the nature of extreme self-lovers, as they will set an house on fire, and it were but to roast their eggs. ("Of Wisdom for a Man's Self') Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested. ("Of Study'') Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. ("Of Studies"') Once our minds arise from their leisurely, everyday meanderings to meet these Essays on their own high level, once we give Ourselves to them with no restraint and no distraction, we find in them a compelling intensity which ever leads us on. Further, here is that undefinable, undeniable lofty tone which is the autograph of great literature. NOTE TO TEACHERS: While you will want to share the above lines with your group, you should also read thoroughly with them one or two of the essays which appeal most to you. If you haven't time to read them all, "Of Truth," "Of Studies," "Of Great Place," and "Of Adversity," might, in this order, prove: most rewarding.

Homer Durham For Tuesday, F ebruary 28, 1950 Objective: To uphold freedom. Public Administration ig is important to have a good government, that is, one which conforms, as far as possible, to the fundamental _ principles previously discussed. Then, government becomes a fit instrument in securing "the good and safety of society." However, day by day, governments are administering thousands of details affecting the lives of millions of people. The enforcement of the law, the administration of governmental policy, is generally called "public administration." The problems of public administration are among the most important of any modern society. The problem of regulating traffic, of Inspecting and maintaining milk at a pure standard, the administration of schools, the building of highways, the protection of life and property—these are only a few of the many tasks undertaken by public administration. Point out the need for electing government officials who will Government Personnel There are many fundamental _ problems in public administration apart from the organization of government itself. These problems concern largely the matter of personnel. Officers must be recruited. Once in office they have the great responsibility of deciding what the law means, when to enforce it, and upon whom to enforce it, Verse three affords an insight into the basic principles which should govern these important problems: We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. This recognizes the necessity and the importance of civil officers and magistrates. During World War II, the United States Government, alone, employed over 3,000,000 civil 782 servants, that is, civil officers exclusive of elected, military, naval, legislative, or judicial officers. 'This does not include the forty-eight states, nor their counties and cities. What should be the method of their administration? The controlling principle is that "such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld." Meaning of "Equity and Justice" What is equity? What is justice? These are often difficult questions in our time. It would be profitable to discuss in every class the question as to what is justice for the working man, for the business leaders, for the members of a minority religious sect, for the members of a dominant religious sect, for alien races, for the various types of people who occupy a place in our civil society. The answers to these questions have obsessed mankind for generations. Is it possible to cut through this mass of speculation and arrive at some foundation principles as guides to equity and justice? The Declaration would suggest that equity and justice would begin with a system of administration which would recognize the fundamental conditions of peace previously discussed. The free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life, at least, are fundamental. Qualifications for Public Officers Who should be selected for public officers? 'The suggestion made in verse three is that those who will RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people, if a republic, or the will of a sovereign. It would be very difficult, of course, for the people of the United States, _ for example, to elect the three million civil servants who served the United States Government from 1942-1945. Then, in addition, to elect the additional millions who work for the forty-eight states, the three thousand and fifty-odd counties, the hundred and_ thirty-two thousand cities and towns, and the other units of government which constitute the American governmental system! However, it is possible to seek and uphold persons who "will administer the law in equity and justice" by means of the civil service examinations and other devices used in American and other governments. Popular election, of course, is desirable for all elected representatives and those who serve in top executive positions. In other circumstances, and in filling the lesser positions, regulations must, of course, be followed. But back of all law, including civil service law, is public opinion. If the public is apathetic, it is impossible to secure officers who will administer the law in equity and justice. How well informed is your class on the method of safeguarding the purity of the water supply, the milk supply, the meat supply, in your community? What officers are administering these laws? Is it being done with equity and justice? Do you know their names? Are they qualified to do their work? When they are performing their work well, LESSON DEPARTMENT Being Informed on Blic Administra tion the ethics and manner of Public administration the great fund individual tights and issue of socialism.

Referred to this this reference, ethics become the 784 mere opinions of men, Americans or others, with resort to force as the threatening reference point. When the State intervenes in the economic order, this value must be recognized. If the conscience, the religious conscience, of man, is free, then there will always be room for the eventual right of control of property and the protection of life. If human law is prevented from prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of man, "nor dictate forms for public or private devotion" then there is a sphere of freedom in which men may live their lives. Need for People to Support Freedom Constitutions are the great preventive influence, but constitutions are valueless without support from the people and the political powers that be. True, the civil magistrate should restrain crime "but never control conscience"; should punish guilt but never suppress the freedom of the soul. This requires popular support. If there is freedom of religious conscience and freedom of the soul, there will probably be freedom for two or more political parties. If there is freedom for two or more political parties, there is freedom in the choice of public officers to enforce the law. If there is freedom to choose these officers, there is also freedom for the people to exercise their right and seek for men in public life who will administer the law in equity and justice. Without this freedom, there will be no essential freedom—and no peace. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 Belief in God Necessary for Good Government In conclusion, it can be stated, that if you destroy belief in God, you destroy belief in the necessity of religious liberty. Decline in belief in God is one of the great forces aiding and abetting Communism. Religious and _ political liberty without belief in God soon become meaningless, because they depend upon mere human toleration, man looking to man. Unless man looks to man as a child of God and then looks beyond and outside of himself for something greater, he may become a menace, a materialistic menace to society. Human toleration without belief in God ls subject to political pleasure, as witness the dictatorships. In short, if you destroy God you destroy the possibility of political ethics having any vitality in government. In its stead, force, and force alone, remains. Force is the tool of the devil. Of such, the Declaration warns, and men should beware. Questions for Discussion and Lesson Helps Special Project: Have someone look up and report the number of offices becoming vacant which will appear on your local ballot at the next general election, describing briefly, the functions of each office. 1. Although all people have the rnght to their own opinions in such matters, who is it that actually (in the bulk of cases) decides what the law means, when to enforce it, and whom to enforce it upon? 2. Have someone look up "equity" in a standard dictionary. Having done this, ask the class to discuss the meaning of "equity" as contained in section 134, verse 3. LESSON DEPARTMENT 3. What is justice? Discuss the principle as suggested in the lesson. 4. How do you suppose the ordinary man's view of justice is formed? Compare this with the concept of the class as to how God, our Father, probably determines and applies justice. 5. What is the relation between public opinion and the administration of "justice?" 785 6. Why is belief in God 'essential to good government? 7. When the butcher sells you a roast and leans a heavy thumb on the scale or includes a large piece of bone at 97c a pound, is he visualizing you as a "child of God" or Mrs. John Customer "from down the street?" 8.

Grant Elder T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, February 28, 1950 THe Presipency A Unrr—THE THREE ARE ONE HEN Heber J. Grant was appointed as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints in 1918, he retained the same counselors who had _ served President Joseph F. Smith, Anthon H. Lund, a man of great character and forceful personality, then in his seventy-fifth year of life, became first counselor. President Grant also appointed him to the responsible position of president of the Salt Lake Temple. He also, by virtue of seniority, became president of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. President Lund vigorously fulfilled his three-fold assignment—counselor in the First Presidency, temple president, and senior apostle. 'These duties he discharged with honor until his death on March 2, 1921, when the Church mourned the passing of a great man and a devoted servant of the Lord. Charles William Penrose The second counselor of President Grant was Charles William Penrose, who was then eighty-six years of age. He was in excellent health and highly respected by both the members of the Church and his numerous acquaintances outside the Church. The years preceding his selection by President Grant had been years of preparation and service for his high calling. President 786 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 CHARLES W. PEN ROSE Penrose was born in Camberwell, London, England, on February 4, 1832, Ata very early age he manifested three unusual traits. First, he was a lover of books, showing a desire to acquire knowledge. Second, he learned to read at an age when most children are concerned entirely with eating and playing. When only four years of age he read the entire Bible, Third, he possessed an unusual memory, being capable of retaining information that he acquired in a very remarkable fashion. During his youth, President PenTose studied the scriptures diligently and, as a result of this study, became dissatisfied with the existing sects of Christendom, being unable to find in them either the religion or the church organization that he read of in the Bible. When he was eightcen years of age he came in contact with the restored gospel and, finding it in agreement with the Bible, was baptized a member of the Church on May 14, 1850. The following January, a month before he was nineteen years of age, he was called on a mission to labor within the British Isles. He had no fjnancial backing, but the Lord provided him with friends and for ten years he labored in Great Britain. The first seven years he was assigned to agricultural areas, and then became President of the Lon. Don district and held other administrative posts in the British Mission. He was a wonderful preacher, being gifted with a powerful, yet pleasIng voice, and 4 fluency of words that enabled him to convince people of his sincerity as well as his ideas, His use of English was unique. He seldom resorted to the use of long or little-used words, but confined himself to the simplest of words in order that the uneducated could gtasp the meaning of his message. Yet there is a gtandeur of thought in his style that manifests the soul of a poet. While engaged as a missionary, President Penrose contributed many articles to the Mil lenial Star dealing with theological and religious Problems. He also wrote poems for its Pages. As the years passed, he longed to gather with the saints in Zion, but year after year his release failed to come. It was then that he wrote "O Ye Mountains High." Ip this song he expressed his longing to be with the body of the Church and be able to serve both the living and the dead. On another occasion when he had been slandered and false accusations had been made against him, he wrote "School Thy Feelings, O My Brother." It was a warning to himself that the Christian thing to do LESSON DEPARTMENT was not to retaliate but to bear the persecution and abuse as Christ would have done. He was finally released in 1861, and emigrated to Utah, settling first at Farmington, where he had to turn from the literary and cultural Pursuits that had characterized his life up to this time, and adjust to the hardships of farming and manual labor. This he willingly did and also taught school for three years, In 1864, he settled in Cache Valley, but the following year he was called again to go on a mission to England, where he served until 1868. His greatest gifts were in the field of mental activities rather than in pioneering, and, in 1870, he moved to Ogden, Utah, where he engaged in newspaper work and represented Weber County in the Territorial Legislature and also in constitutional conventions that were seeking to acquire statehood for the Territory of Utah. In 1877, Brigham Young persuaded him to come to Salt Lake City and join the staff of The Deseret News. Very soon his gifted pen was improving the quality of that Paper and making its editorials sparkle with thought-provoking Comments. In 1880, he was made editor-in-chief of The Deseret News, a position he held for the ensuing twelve years. During this time he was often in Washington, D. C,, where he worked to secure statehood for Utah and also worked for the interests of the Church. Charles W. Penrose later accepted employment as editor-in-chief of the Salt Lake Herald, and for four years devoted his talents to promoting this paper. President Wilford 787 Woodruff appointed him to the position of assistant Church historian, He then devoted his energies to the work of this office and, in addition, wrote articles for the Church peniodicals and for use in the mission fields of the Church. Most noteworthy of his efforts in this respect was the writing of a series of twelve tracts known as "Rays of Living Light." These tracts have been translated into many languages and distributed widely. Millions of them have been used and, so effective are they, that even after more than half a century they are still used by our missionaries, For several years, commencing again in 1899, Elder PenTose was editor-in-chief of The Deseret News and wrote ably and forcefully about world and Church problems. During these years of literary activity, he had not neglected the gospel cause that had brought him to the valleys of the mountains. He served as a local missionary, taught in Sunday Schools and, in 1884, was chosen as a counselor in the Salt Lake Stake presidency. In June of 1904, President Joseph F. Smith Selected him as a member of the Church Board of Education and the following month he was chosen to fill a vacancy in the Council of the Twelve. From December 1906 until June 1910, Charles W. Penrose served as president of the European Mission, with headquarters in Liverpool, England. He supervised the missionary work both in Great Britain and on the Continent of Europe. During this time more than 25,000,000 tracts were distributed and 8,441 baptisms performed. 788 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1949 When President John Henry Smith died in 1911, Elder Penrose was selected to fill the vacancy in the First Presidency. He was set apart to this office on December 7, 1911, and although he was just two months less than eighty years of age, he had a powerful and vigorous personality. Immediately he threw himself with characteristic energy into the work of the Presidency and became an able assistant to President Smith. He traveled widely in the interests of the Church, visiting the wards and stakes, and took an active part in acquiring possession for the Church of some of the landmarks of early Church history. He was ably assisting President Smith at the time of the latter's death in 1918. President Grant retained him as second counselor and, upon the death of President Anthon H. Lund in March 1921, Brother Penrose, now past eighty-nine, was sustained as first counselor. The unusual energy of this man, strengthened by the Holy Spirit, enabled him to aid President Grant with advice, as a result of his mature years and long experience, and also by actively participating in the Church's ever-growing work. Anthony Woodward Ivins The elevation of President Penrose to the rank of first counselor left a vacancy in the First Presidency. 'To this position Anthony Woodward Ivins was appointed on March 10, 1921. President Ivins was born on 'Tom's River, New Jersey, on September 16, 1852. His mother was a sister of the mother of President Grant, and his father ANTHONY W. IVINS was her cousin. They emigrated to Utah in 1853. In 1861 the parents of Brother Ivins were called to settle in Washington County and it was there that President Ivins grew to manhood and acquired his education. Asa young man, Anthony W. Ivins determined that he would avoid evil company and seek the companionship of boys and men who could help him gain and retain a testimony of the gospel. To his dying day he testified that this had been one of the greatest factors in his life as it had enabled him to learn good habits of living, ideals, moral standards, and habits of industry and integrity. As a consequence, he studied the principles of the gospel and read everything that came into his possession that was noble or uplifting. The formal schooling of Brother Ivins was very meager, as was the case with most boys of pioneer days. However, he read widely and before he had LESSON DEPARTMENT reached the age of thirty, had acquired a good education. During his sojourn in St. George, he held the following positions: constable, city councilor, city attorney, and later, county attorney, mayor, deputy shenff, county assessor and collector, State representative, delegate to the State constitutional convention, and Federal Indian agent. In spite of his lack of classroom education, this self-made lawyer met some of the best school-trained lawyers from the larger cities in court; and the judicial history of the southern part of Utah tells us he never lost a case he defended or prosecuted. In addition to fulfilling these positions of trust and public service for his pioneer community, President Ivins engaged in the cattle and sheep business and at one time was one of the largest livestock operators in Southern Utah, Northern Arizona, and Eastern Nevada. But in spite of these multitudinous duties, he never forgot the Church. He held positions in ward and stake Sunday Schools and the Y. M. M. I. A., served as a missionary among the Navajo Indians of Atizona, was a member of the St. George Stake high council and, in 1888, became first counselor in the presidency of that stake. The Church Authorities had called people to settle in the Mexican State of Chihuahua and, as these Latterday Saint settlements grew, it was decided to organize a stake of Zion for their benefit. In December 1895, Anthony W. Ivins was called to go to Mexico and assume this responsibility. Selling out all of his holdings in land and livestock, he moved to Mexico with his family.

I just turned the pages at random, and the picture—the First Presidencies—page 568, caught my eye. John R. Winder was my own father's grandfather; Charles W. Penrose was my dear mother's grandfather, and my husband was christened Anthon Wm. Lundberg, which is so much the same as the name of the counselor. I love The Relief Society Magazine and wait from month to month for it to arrive. At present I am physically handicapped and I cannot go to meetings, so my greatest source of entertainment and recreation is sitting out in the sunshine reading my Relief Society Magazine. Thanks for making it so interesting and inspiring. —Alice Winder Bradford Lundberg, Washington, D. C. I am taking this opportunity to tell you how extremely well I liked the editorial concerning women sewing together (September 1949). It touched a responsive note in me. If women would only sew together more frequently instead of playing so much bridge, there would, I believe, be less unrest.... Some of my most loyal friends are women with whom I sewed in girlhood. I was occupational therapist in a hospital for over seven years and saw women cured of mental illness through being taught to create beauty with the needle, shuttle, crochet hook, and even with only the use of their fingers in making macrame. Even while nursing I taught the art of the needle to my patients during convalescence. It helped to keep them contented and happy. I wish that every woman everywhere might read your editorial. Such articles are much needed. —Gene Romolo, Provo, Utah You would think, from my husband's attitude, that The Relief Society Magazine is published for men only. He hides the Magazine and keeps it hidden until he has read it from cover to cover. Then, it is my turn, and I enjoy every issue. —Alvina A.

I am literary class leader in Garden Creek Ward, Portneuf Stake, and really cannot do justice to my lessons without the Magazine. Just recently, in time of trouble, I went to my attic where I store all my surplus reading material and in perusing my Magazines from past years I found articles that brought solace to my soul.
