Orchid Hunting in Honduras Elizabeth Williamson promised to tell you about our orchid-hunting expeditions (unscientific! ) here in the center of Honduras. As you remember, I never cared particularly for orchids. Of course, we were thrilled at school when someone sent us a corsage with an orchid in it, but I was impressed not so much by the beauty and rarity of the flower as to why anyone would spend five dollars for an orchid when ten cents worth of violets would have made me happy! Anyhow, I've changed my mind. Orchids are magnificent! And, furthermore, I've learned to like them. Some are so tiny it is difficult to see the structure of the bloom. They come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. They grow wild, and are uncultivated. 'The native women gather and bring them down from the mountains in basketfuls on their heads. 'They sell them for fifty centavos a bunch! (twenty-five cents in Our money). We first became interested in orchids while we were picnicking and, accidentally, found some on an old oak tree. 'They were a beautiful long spray of tawny gold blossoms, with dark brown spots on the petals. We didn't find any more that day. They are most elusive and especially well camouflaged. They grow in the most inaccessible places, high in an old (and very rotten) oak tree, or on the side of a cliff. From that day on, we were absorbed in orchid-hunting. Something like searching for pirate's treasure—I can understand how fasPage 390 cinated scientists and archaeologists are in finding and developing their special interests. We were only amateurs and knew very little, technically or botanically, but we were spurred on by the hunt, the reward —the fun in general. We _ never knew what species would be revealed. If we made a find we could bring it back—give it to a collector or hang it on a nail in our patio, water it occasionally, and it would thrive and bloom like mad. (Incidentally my favorite find was a pale green orchid about one inch in diameter. It grew in a cluster of three or four. I never saw one like it again and didn't identify it.) We usually went in groups on our hunts, people who liked to hike primarily (but the not-toostrenuous type). In one of our groups there was an archaeologist, a naturalist and his wife, a young Swiss outdoor man, an artist, and usually another couple for good measure. (All of the people in the group were interested in photography.) FE, took sandwiches, chocolate, fruit, things we could carry in our pockets, ice and a soft drink for after the hunt. We piled into a station wagon, as it seemed to hold more people and specimens. The day I remember particularly well because of the loot was the Provividencia Day. Providencia is an orphanage farm for small boys. It is a lovely place in the pines about seven miles from Josef Muench © re Q = w) \e) a es] esl Zz, " 392 town. In the main building we could get refreshments served by the Swiss in charge of the orphanage. The surrounding country is very much like our own mountain country in northern Arizona or New Mexico. Or, as a matter of fact, almost anywhere where there are pines and a scant undergrowth. 'The elevation is about thirty-five hundred feet. It seemed strange to hike through pines and oaks and suddenly come upon a banana plant or a palm tree. Otherwise we felt quite at home. At the beginning I felt rather dubious about the snake situation, but during the two years we were there I never saw a snake. Doubtless, there are many at lower altitudes. However, there were plenty of seed-ticks and red bugs—not harmful, but annoying beyond description. On Providencia Day we left the orphanage farm and took a trail through the pine woods. The naturalist was helpful in pointing RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 out new plants and birds. The Swiss explained the correct walking technique. (It was amazing how it worked and helped!) Frequently we took little side trails on our own, searching and discovering this and that. That day we heard a whistle from a distance and saw the naturalist walking rapidly towards us. When he reached us we asked him what had happened, what he had found. He was disturbingly calm and said, "Come along, I want to show you something magnifico!" We went down a path until we came to a hollow which looked like a deserted banana grove. We climbed through overgrown brush and tangled vines, down into the bananas. I imagined I could see little bright eyes peering at me, eyes of unknown creatures waiting to bite, sting, or wrap themselves around my body and squeeze me to death! Nothing happened. Then at the bottom of the grove we were told to turn around and look up. We saw a beautiful thing—a small ORCHID HUNTING IN HONDURAS cliff banked solidly with fragile white orchid blooms. Some had turned to yellow. We discovered later that although they remained fresh and firm, they turned yellow before they died. True to form it was almost impossible to reach them. However, we carried back a few specimens. They were identified later as "Estrella del mar'—Star of the Sea. We thought it a most satisfying day and relaxed contentedly over our refreshments in the orphanage patio. 'The Swiss lady in charge was exuberant about our discovery. She 393 probably knew where many other orchids were hidden which she had passed by on her numerous rides through the country by burro back. But she also knew it was much more fun and soul-satisfying to make these discoveries ourselves. P. S. When we were ready to leave the orphanage each of the women in the group was presented with a huge bunch of violets from the Swiss lady's own garden! _-
