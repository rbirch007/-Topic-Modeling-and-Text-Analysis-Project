sunlight on a mountain peak. Roses, summer, youth, and love Inseparable as stars and moon, Or love song whispered tenderly, As the lark's first ecstatic tune. Young Hearts Are Fragile Olive W. Burt HE superintendent of the Children's Aid Society was very kind. Martha felt that kindness spreading out from the calm gray eyes and the gentle mouth above the strong chin, spreading out and enveloping her like a bland ointment on her hurt heart. "T''m sorry, Mrs. Lewis," the quiet voice was saying. "I recognize your need and it is a very real and urgent one. But," she hesitated and then went on firmly, "please try to understand our position. Our concern is first of all for the children in our care. 'They need homes and love, yes; but they need more than just that. 'They need to live out their destinies—" Martha stared at the woman. What was she trying to say? What was the message behind her words? Was she intimating that she and Bill would not let the child live out his destiny? That was absurd. Why, they would do everything in their power to improve and enrich that destiny! They would give him everything Danny had had—Danny— The superintendent — glanced down at the filled out forms on her desk. "Your son was an only child, Mrs. Lewis. He was a wonderful boy—a shining, golden personality. And he died as he had lived, brilliantly —a hero." Martha felt the rent in her heart aching again as it always ached when Dan was mentioned. It was a tender ache, a proud ache, for Dan had been more than they said. He had well earned every tribute given him. But there was something lacking in the speaker's voice. She spoke of Dan calmly, honestly, but without that tinge of envy that crept involuntarily into most women's voices when they spoke of Martha's son. It was almost as if she didn't think that being a hero was so much. "You would find our little boys are not like your Dan. Not one of them, I think." Of course not! Martha thought. There is no one in the world like Dan. "But we'd do our best to make him—" Martha began, and was stopped by the coldness that froze the smile on the superintendent's lips. That is what we feared, Mrs. Lewis. You and Mr. Lewis have an ideal in your hearts — an ideal no child could equal in your estimation. We do not want to place these children in situations that will make for unhappiness for them— and for you, too; but, mainly, we are concerned with the children. No, I am afraid that, desperately as these children need the homes that have been denied them, we must reject your application." Martha could not believe the words. Reject their application! There was something wrong here. She stood up, angry, suspicious. "Is there something I have neglected," she asked cruelly, "a preliminary bonus?" Page 377 378 A faint flush rose with difficulty in the clear cheeks of the superintendent, who also rose. But her voice was still calm and quiet. "Yes," she said, "I am afraid there is something you have neglected, Mrs. Lewis, to put the child's need before your own." She gathered up the papers with a gesture that dismissed Martha, and, trembling with anger and hurt as if she had been slapped, Martha turned and hurried out of the room, down the dim hall, and into the street. Bill would hear about this. Bill would do something! Half-blinded by the sunlight, Martha stumbled actoss the street to the comforting green of a doll-sized park against the gray of pavement and buildings. She sat down on a bench, shaking with anger and disappointment, and watched the children playing around her, only half-seeing their bright, fluttering figures, only halfhearing their tinkling voices. It was going to be terrible, telling Bill this. She couldn't make him understand, because she didn't understand, herself, what was wrong. Maybe she would if she thought about it awhile. She hadn't understood about the little baby, either, at first. Probably her perception had been dulled by her sorrow, because before Dan's death she had been quick enough to catch and interpret innuendoes. T had been hard to persuade Bill that they should adopt a baby to take a tiny measure of the empty space left in their hearts with Dan's going. 'Their hearts had been so full when Dan was there—his sturdy masculinity demanding so much, his RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 ardent love of life filling them, completing them, spilling out of their hearts into affection for his playmates, his schoolmates, his buddies, his girl friends. There had been no emptiness then, At last, Bill, seeing her need, had said, "Of course, honey, if that's what you want. But a baby will be hard work—and you're not as young as you were when Dan was little. And I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, too. But if you want to try it—" With no more encouragement than that, she had gone to the baby placement bureau and applied for a child. "We want a boy—a husky, blond, athletic type," she had stipulated, feeling that they would enjoy the child more if he resembled Danny. If Bill could teach him to fish and swim and play football and _baseball, he might forget, just a little, what he had lost. She had filled out the proper forms. She had been eager at the interviews. She had spoken freely of their hopes and plans and of what they would do for the baby. "We can give him everything he needs or wants," she had said, not boasting, but hoping to impress the authorities. "We have a lovely farm—we haven't gone there for two years, but the lease is soon up. We can take the baby there—give him a pony—our Danny loved his pony and was a wonderful rider—" The woman had asked once, "Would you consider a girl baby?" and Martha had hesitated. She, herself, would love a little girl, but Bill —it would be difficult enough for a boy to take Dan's place. How YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE could a girl fit in? She had managed to convey this to the matron, who seemed to understand. But in the end it hadn't mattered, for it turned out that there was a tule against giving tiny babies to couples as old as Martha and Bill. She had been surprised. Somehow, she had thought any agency would be glad to give a baby to them, who could do so much for it. Their own boy had been an example of their fitness as parents—Dan, gay, eager, well-adjusted, healthy. But after she thought about it awhile she could see that they were right. She had never thought of herself or Bill as old, but they were centainly not young—and it had been a long time since Dan had been a baby. Maybe they would find it difficult to cope with a lively little fellow. Martha's problem was to explain this to Bill in such a way as not to hurt him, in such a way as to leave the path open for some other solution. HEN the time came, she couldn't tell whether Bill was relieved or disappointed. 'There were so many things about Bill that she couldn't understand nowadays. They were in some ways so much closer together, so much more dependent upon each other for happiness and companionship. And yet there was an invisible wall between them—a wall of fearfulness lest one hurt the other. Then Bill had said carefully, "A little baby might not have been such a good idea after all. But perhaps we could get an older child. I understand there's some society that finds homes for older children." That had convinced her. Bill was counting on this, too, to ease 379 the hurt that grew more and more terrifying as the empty weeks went "She had looked up the society Bill had mentioned and had made application there. She had been excited when she returned home after the preliminary interview, when she had seen the children in their classrooms. "Oh, Bill! I'm sure this is better. We can see what they are like— we can find one that just suits us. They are so nice, the people in charge. They say it's important that the child suits us and that we suit the child. We'll find one that likes skiing and tennis. He can have Dan's room, and Dan's trophies and cups will give him an ideal to live up to." And then, after all, their application had been denied! Slowly, feeling every one of her forty years like a separate burden upon her, Martha rose from the bench and walked slowly home to the empty apartment, emptier now, since she had dreamed of it filled with blond and boisterous youth. When she told Bill that night after dinner about the agency he took it more calmly than she had hoped. He reached out for her hand as she stood before him, hurt and angry, and drew her down onto his lap, cuddling her, making a child of her in his utter need. "They're right, honey," he said huskily. "It wouldn't work out for us. For some folks, yes, but not for us. We've had the best—"' his voice faltered. After a moment he went on, "You can't tell what they're like —even a kid of six or seven. He might look like Dan—a little—but 380 what if he turned out to be stupid, or a coward? I'd hate having him around." Martha leaned against him, comforting him, but the shadowy wall between them was thick and impenetrable. And _ before them stretched long, empty, futile years of remembering. Bill set her from his knees and rose and began to walk restlessly about the room. Before long he said, as he said so frequently of late, "Tve got to get out for a few minutes. Do you want to go for a walk?" Weary as she was, she nodded silently, and they went down onto the street, quiet in the shadows and solitude of the night. They began to walk—to walk until they could return home, physically _ tired enough to sleep. URING these walks Martha felt nearer to Bill. Here they walked silently, with no pretense at gaiety or at casualness. 'The poplars whispered above their heads and from open windows scraps of music floated out. But they were alone and unobserved, even by each other. There was no conscious direction to their steps, and neither one knew just where they were, when a sudden noise recalled them from their world of shadows. They were approaching a square, official-looking building, with a lighted globe above the doorway. At the curb, opposite the door, a knot of men and boys were leaving cars, and it was the scuffling among these that had caught their attention. "What's happening, Bill?" Martha asked, trying to reidentify herself with the real world around her. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 Bill glanced up at the building and understood at once. "This is the police station," he said. "Looks as if some kids are being rounded up." "Kids?" she asked. She stared at the group moving across the sidewalk; at the officers, big and husky with guns at their hips, and at the boys, dragging back, hitching their bodies as far as they dared, their boldness brought to a sharp edge by the hone of fear. "Oh, Bill! What have they done?" Bill shrugged. "Stolen a car, maybe. Or snatched a purse. Or broken into a cigar store. No telling what a kid will do." Suddenly, right in front of them, one of the boys, the very smallest one in the group, gave a quick twitch to his shoulder, broke from the policeman's grasp, and darted past them down the street. The officer yelled and started in pursuit. Martha wanted to put out her foot and trip the officer. She wanted to, but she didn't. She just stood there, watching. And in a moment the officer came back, panting, dragging the boy with him. "BILL" Martha whispered, "can we go in? Can we find out what they've done and what will be done with them?" Bill looked at her. "It won't be fun,' he said. "They're probably a tough little gang. We'd better move on and let the law handle this." "Tm not going to interfere, but I've got to see, Bill. I couldn't sleep if I didn't." | They followed the group inside the station and to the booking YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE sergeant. Martha stood just inside the doorway, holding Bill's arm, her eyes searching for the little fellow who had almost got away. He stood with the others, but apart from them, a skinny, dirty little youngster in soiled levis and a ragged shirt. The belt around his middle was drawn tight, and Martha felt like crying at the tiny girth of leather, as if there were not much more than backbone to circle. His eyes were downcast, and Martha found herself wondering what the eyes would be like, and wishing the child would raise his lashes so she could see. As she watched, he did raise his eyes and looked towards her, and there was no miracle there. Their brown irises seemed opaque, so that Martha could not see into them at all, could not read what went on behind them. Instead of being disappointed with this, Martha felt sad, as if it were somehow her fault. She began to listen to what was being said in the room, and had no difficulty in discovering that this was a band of juvenile car plunderers for whom the police had been hunting a long time. One of the boys, a youngster of about fourteen, seemed to be the leader. The little fellow who had tried to get away wouldn't talk when they spoke to him, wouldn't give his name, so the leader spoke up for him. "He won't tell nobody his name," he said. "Call him Skinny. Skinny Jones will do." He shrugged. "He's kinda dumb, someways, but he's little and quick—" So they make use of him, Martha thought angrily. She turned to Bill. "What will be done with them?" 381 "They'll get hold of all the parents they can. Some of the boys will probably be taken out to the boys' home on South State. 'Tomorrow they'll investigate more thoroughly. Some will be sent to the State reformatory—" "But if that little fellow won't tell his name—" "They'll get it. Don't worry." | iene then Skinny raised his arm and wiped his nose with one long swipe of his ragged shirt sleeve, his brown eyes wide and hard and unwavering. The pitiful inadequacy and helplessness of that gesture caught Martha's heart and twisted it tight. "Let's get along," Bill said, but Martha stood still. "Wait, Bill. Wait." When the boys had been taken out of the room, Martha stepped up to the sergeant's desk. "What about a little fellow like that—Skinny?" she asked, absurdly anxious to know that things would be all right with him. The sergeant looked down at her and smiled. His eyes were gray and kind with little crow's feet to humor at the corners. "Don't worry about him, ladv. We'll take care of him." "But you don't even know his name—or his mother—" "It won't be hard to find. He'll talk before morning—they all do when they're caught for the first time, even when they're as tough as that kid." "Tough?" Tough enough to keep his eyes dry, but not his nose! "Look, lady," the sergeant said, "they're a tough gang, and he's tough or he wouldn't last ten min- 382 utes with them. His mother you ask about is probably tough, too. We have 'em every night—kids like this. During the war their dads went gallivanting off to big war plants and their mothers went out to grab off some of the big money that was floating around. The kids had to shift for themselves. And we knew that's the way it was, and hoped it would soon be over. "But now many of those dads don't want to come back and pick up their old jobs and old families again; and the mothers don't hanker after working at home for nothing. So they chase whatever moncy they can find, and the kids are still left to get along as best they can. They've had half a dozen years now to grow tough in, and believe me, lady, they can't be handled like the kids you're used to knowing. Surprisingly Bill spoke up. "Isn't there something that we could do, officer? Don't you parole these kids to reputable families?" The sergeant smiled. "] haven't seen many reputable families asking for them," he said. Then he nodded. "Yeah, that's the theory—but who wants to take in a kid like that? Listen, you folks don't know the score. Go home and forget it. Or if you can't forget it, if you really want to do something, come back tomorrow and talk to the captain." They went out into the street, Martha clinging to Bill's arm. "T don't want him to stay there a single night," she whispered, tears choking her. "And of course when his mother knows—" "The sergeant's right about her, probably," Bill said, and went on RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 thoughtfully, "but that kid isn't bad—yet. You know, I got in a jam like that once—" They walked along in silence, Martha waiting to hear, knowing that Bill had never told her this because, though it had been of tremendous importance to him at the time, there had never been a place for it in their life together. VEAH," he said at last, "I got m with a gang that stripped light fixtures from empty homes. They called my mother and she I wish you could have seen her. Some of the mothers came weeping and wringing their hands as if their kids were ruined for life. Some came down swearing at the cops as if their kids had done nothing at all, mother came down, calm and quiet "She talked to me, not the cops, and she made me do my own talk. Ing to them. I don't know how to explain the way I felt—ashamed of myself for what I'd done, but proud of my mother and proud to be man enough to own up and take my medicine. And I was determined I'd never get into a mess like that again," After a long time he said, "Skinny needs someone that knows how to handle a thing like that—I wonder if his mother does." Martha was unable to sleep, thinking of Skinny in a room full of tough boys; talking, as the sergeant had promised he would, because that ridiculous nose of his would not give him any peace with the tears crowding back of it, hurting his eyes and his throat. And she YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE knew that, beside her, Bill wasn't sleeping, either. She wasn't surprised then, when Bill said the next morning after breakfast, "Guess Ill drive down and see what happened to the kids. Want to go along?" Martha nodded. She had remembered in the night about the little baby and the boy that had been denied them. It was no use, and she wished now that she could keep this last disappointment from Bill. In those last weary hours before dawn, she had resigned herself to forget Skinny and all other small boys and to accept the dreariness of her empty heart. MARTHA was amazed at the sure and determined manner with which Bill approached the captain. When he mentioned the boys that had been brought in the night before, the captain nodded, looking at the report sheet before him. Most of those boys are old offenders," he said. "They will be committed to the State industrial school." "Not that little one—Skinny?" Martha breathed. "Well," the Captain frowned. "His mother was located and talked to. She isn't a fit person to have charge of him and she doesn't want to be bothered." "But there is a parole for adult criminals," Bill protested, "what about paroling the kid to us?" The captain looked at him. "You don't know what you're taking on, Mister," he said gruffly. "When his mother finds out that you're interested, she won't hear of adoption. She'll let you take him and then hope to get something out 383 of you through the kid, and as soon as he begins earning money, his mother will pop up and demand him back again. And it just means that you folks, with the best intentions in the world, will have your hearts broken." Martha looked at him. "Our hearts broken?" she asked softly. "Captain, it's the young whose hearts are fragile. Let us help! If we can only keep his heart from being destroyed—" It was a long time after that before they were finally seated in the car, actually on their way home, with Skinny tucked between: them on the wide front seat. Martha glanced carefully down at the shock of dirty, black hair. 'The brown eyes had not lost their opaqueness, their secretiveness, and they stared ahead, unquestioning, unanswering. The captain had explained that this custody was temporary. 'The case would have to come before the Juvenile Court, and then a licensed social agency would place the boy in a foster home—perhaps in Martha's home. As Martha watched him, Skinny lifted his arm and wiped his sleeve across his nose, not sniffling, not admitting weakness, but driven to that gesture by the forces that were relentless within him. Bill's hand left the wheel and reached for his handkerchief. Handing it casually to Skinny, he said, "Blow hard, Son!" Only then did Martha remember Dan. | Never another Dan, she thought. This is our new son. This is Skinny. And suddenly all in the car were at peace. El] Paso and the Latter-Day Saints Sadie Ollorton Clark President, Houston, Texas, Branch Relief Society T was in April 1910, that Porfirio | Diaz finally became alarmed over the brewing Mexican revolution. He threw the frail idealist, Francesco Madero, into the San Luis Potosi prison and thereby ended a third of a century of absolute dictatorship. Little did he realize that a forced American migration would follow this act, nor did the unsuspecting Latter-day Saint colonists know how soon they would have to flee from their homes, or which families would be responsible for a new stronghold of the Church —the yet unborn El Paso Ward. The location of the city of El Paso has much to do with it's colorful history. 'The first name, "Fl Paso del Norte," means the "northern pass." The Rio Grande River, at this point, flows through the cactus-covered mountains, creating the best natural passage from the north to south in many desert miles. It was equally important as a station in stage-coach days, and was the key point in a transcontinental railroad building race in 1881. In the sixteenth century the venturesome Franciscan friars, traveling from Mexico City to Santa Fe with the Spanish explorers on the dusty Camino Real would give thanks for the grateful shade of the cottonwoods growing on the banks of the river, and would rest at this oasis in the desert. 'Today, cross-country tourists find this modern city a natural breaking point in a journey east or west. Page 384 American historians tell us the first white visitor to this colorful land was Cabeza de Vaca, the only survivor of the shipwrecked Navarez expedition of 1527. He found his way to this area in 1536 and was welcomed by the Indians living there. He was never able to explain why one tribe after another looked upon him as their God, asking him to heal their sick and bless their food and their children. For the next three hundred years this territory was under Spanish and Mexican rule. As a result of the battle of San Jacinto in April 1836, it became part of the Republic of Texas. In 1846 Texas was annexed by the United States. Of interest to Latter-day Saint readers is the fact that Alexander Doniphan was the first man to bring the American flag to El Paso. This was in 1846, during the wat with Mexico. Doniphan was loved by the Missouri saints because he befriended them in the unhappy days when they were expelled from Jackson County. When he was ordered to execute the Prophet Joseph Smith he refused, and told his superior, "It is cold blooded murder. I will not obey your order. If you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God." The chief settlement in those exciting days was on the south side of the river. El Paso was known as "Franklin," and was too small to be very well-known. The Mormon Courtesy, Chamber of Commerce, El Paso, Texas VIEW OF MAIN BUSINESS SECTION, EL PASO, TEXAS Page 385 386 Battalion crossed the desert a few miles north of the village, in 1846, on their journey to California. In 1876, Anthony W. Ivins, with a party going to Mexico, camped on the north bank of the river, and shot a deer on the spot which is now the center of the city. In 1897, the Church Authorities asked Isaac W. Pierce to go to Cuidad Juarez and open up a lumper yard for the benefit of the people living in the timber regions of Chihuahua. He was the first Latter-day Saint to live in this locality, and his residence was a home for all friends going to and coming from Mexico. The first Church services in that city were held in his own house. Isaac Pierce was truly a benefactor to hundreds of travelers who came to him for aid, and he kept up his good work as long as he lived. He died in 1906. His son, Arwell L. Pierce, carried on his father's business as well as his interest in the Church. In 1912 he moved from Cuidad Juarez. He was the first Latter-day Saint to make a permanent home in El Paso, and when he moved there the Church came with him. But: in 1912, the old order passed in Mexico. One of the first demands the revolutionists made was the evacuation of the Latter-day Saints who had sought refuge in their land. Because of the Edmunds law, which was passed in 1882, a small group of Church members felt that the only way 'they could keep their families together was to leave the United States and make Mexico their home. In the decade preceding the turn of the century, they migrated to this southRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 ern country. Though few of them gave up their American citizenship, they all had come to look upon Mexico as their homeland. Their buildings were permanent, their plans for the future were all to be fulfilled in Mexico. But suddenly, and without warning, orders were given to leave.. Villa and his bandits were moving in on the villages, and it was worth a man's life to stay and defend his property. The colonists had prospered in Mexico, and the homes they left behind were spacious and beautiful. 'They were denied time enough to salvage their portable possessions. Beautiful china, valuable silver, precious keepsakes and _heirlooms were all left to be confiscated or destroyed by the marauding outlaws. J. W. Wilson of El Paso tells that he was in bed with a broken back, in the village of Pearson, when word came that Villa was on top of the mountain near the little town. The Americans left, wasting no time. Mr. Wilson refused any offers of help. He crawled to the top story of the house and hid himself. 'Through an attic window he watched the bandit army as it marched through and ransacked the town, looting, robbing, and even killing several of the native — citizens, then riding on. When Mr. Wilson did leave Mexico, he came, as most of the refugees did, to Cuidad Juarez on the train. He says: The railroad was so badly torn up and so many revolutionists were on it, that I was just two weeks from the time I left my home until I crossed the bridge into FE] Paso at three in the morning. The Mexican soldiers searched me and took all the cash I had before they would let me come across. When I landed on the EL PASO AND THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS American side I looked up and saw the Stars and Stripes waving for me. Never did that flag look so good to me before. This was typical of the condition of more than 3500 people. 'They came to El Paso destitute and penniless. 'Their American citizenship was not questioned, but the town was not prepared for such a multitude. 'The officials of the city did all they could to help them, but the townspeople received them with mixed emotions—pity for their plight and hesitancy about taking in so many of a despised people. As there were no houses ready for them at the time, the refugees were unloaded at a lumber yard, and as long as they were in desperate need the United States government fed them. Without any delay, the separate families set up housekeeping between piles of boards and shingles, making the best of what they had until they could improve their situaLATTER-DAY SAINT CHAPEL, EL 387 tions. The unconquerable pioneer spirit of these people showed itself in these trying days. It would have taken a greater catastrophe than this to make them give up. While the women cooked and washed over the campfires, husbands and _ fathers surveyed the town for jobs and vacant houses. Within a week, over half of them had found work and had rented homes. Before a month had passed the entire company had left the lumber yard. [MMEDIATELY after their arrival, Senator A. B. Fall asked for a government appropriation for their immediate aid, and money to send them any place in the United States where they had relatives to help, or an assurance of work. Approximately seventy-five per cent of the refugees accepted this aid, and left El Paso. Most of them went to Utah, but many of the people decided to remain, and it is they who became PASO, TEXAS 388 the nucleus of the present El Paso Ward. They and their children have become respected citizens of the border city. Many of them are now prominent in business, political, and professional circles. 'They have built beautiful and substantial homes, and, all in all, take an important part in the community. One of the beauty spots of the El Paso valley is the country home of Bishop George Q. Payne. It is built of native stone, typical of its surroundings, but it is unusual because of the variety and beauty of the flowers and shrubs which grow in profusion in his gardens. The arid and rocky soil of this country can produce vegetation, but it takes labor and devotion to beautify even a small yard. The saints of the El] Paso Ward take great pride in their chapel. For years the erection of a suitable meetinghouse was the common aim and desire of every Latter-day Saint family in the vicinity, and practically every member has some personal interest in it. It cost approximately $75,000 and compares favorably with the most beautiful and expensive chapels in the Church today. The building is a modified Spanish type, in keeping with the best architecture of the city. The lawns are always green and well-kept, even during the winter. The custodian, Otto Baptist, a convert from Belgium, takes special pride in the upkeep of the Church property. He is, and has been, the only custodian since the chapel was built in 1931. A friendly and gracious spirit seems to radiate from the walls of this sacred edifice, and to the members it is indeed a second home. On RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 Sunday mornings they gather on the patio and visit in the warm sunshine. After the evening meeting the foyer is crowded with a friendly, handshaking group who refuse to leave until the last light is turned off. The membership of the ward is constantly increasing because visitors, first impressed by the fraternity and feeling of fellowship the members show for one another, are willing to listen to the truths of the gospel. The El Paso Ward has had only two bishops. Arwell L. Pierce was ordained the bishop in 1918 when the ward was first organized, and he remained in that position until 1942, when he was called to preside over the Mexican Mission. He, more than any other one individual, is responsible for the growth and the happy condition of the ward. He has been a prominent business man for many years in El Paso, but his greatest interest has always been in the welfare of the Church and the people who came to it. His home has been a haven for visitors going to or coming from Mexico, and most of the General Authorities of the Church have enjoyed his hospitality. Because of his unusual possession of a dual citizenship, and also because of the great respect he commands, he has been able to render service to thousands of travelers who have had difficulty in crossing the international border. Whether it was a misunderstanding of the language, laws, or personalities, a call to Bishop Pierce would generally solve the problem. Bishop George Q. Payne has carried on this excellent work. He guided the ward through the war EL PASO AND THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS years, when, because of the proximity of Fort Bliss to El Paso, hundreds of Latter-day Saint boys were able to come to Church. Special Priesthood classes were held for these service men. The MLA. Planned a full recreation program, and no Latter-day Saint boy needed to investigate the night clubs on the Mexican side of the river for entertainment. 'There were seventy-two boys who served under their country's flag, from the E] Paso Ward. The El Paso Ward was first a part of Juarez Stake, with headquarters in Mexico. In 1919 it was annexed to the St. Joseph Stake, and when St. Joseph was divided, El Paso became a member of the Mt. Graham 389 Stake. Its membership now totals around 700. A high percentage of the people are active in Church work, and a most gratifying number pay a full tithing. Officers travel 250 miles each way every month to attend union meetings at Safford, Arizona, and several high council members and stake officers are members of the El Paso Ward. The dauntless and lofty spirit which has always characterized this group seems to be diffused into all who have later come to make EI Paso their home. Although it was born of revolution and bloodshed, its ultimate destiny seems to be a working unit in the kingdom of God.: ———> Pastoral Gene Romolo Above the emerald herbage-covered hills, A shining dawn arises from the night And one full-throated song thrush blithely trills A paean for the largess of the light.

Of course, we were thrilled at school when someone sent us a corsage with an orchid in it, but I was impressed not so much by the beauty and rarity of the flower as to why anyone would spend five dollars for an orchid when ten cents worth of violets would have made me happy! Anyhow, I've changed my mind. Orchids are magnificent! And, furthermore, I've learned to like them. Some are so tiny it is difficult to see the structure of the bloom. They come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. They grow wild, and are uncultivated. 'The native women gather and bring them down from the mountains in basketfuls on their heads. 'They sell them for fifty centavos a bunch! (twenty-five cents in Our money). We first became interested in orchids while we were picnicking and, accidentally, found some on an old oak tree. 'They were a beautiful long spray of tawny gold blossoms, with dark brown spots on the petals. We didn't find any more that day. They are most elusive and especially well camouflaged. They grow in the most inaccessible places, high in an old (and very rotten) oak tree, or on the side of a cliff. From that day on, we were absorbed in orchid-hunting. Something like searching for pirate's treasure—I can understand how fasPage 390 cinated scientists and archaeologists are in finding and developing their special interests. We were only amateurs and knew very little, technically or botanically, but we were spurred on by the hunt, the reward —the fun in general. We _ never knew what species would be revealed. If we made a find we could bring it back—give it to a collector or hang it on a nail in our patio, water it occasionally, and it would thrive and bloom like mad. (Incidentally my favorite find was a pale green orchid about one inch in diameter. It grew in a cluster of three or four. I never saw one like it again and didn't identify it.) We usually went in groups on our hunts, people who liked to hike primarily (but the not-toostrenuous type). In one of our groups there was an archaeologist, a naturalist and his wife, a young Swiss outdoor man, an artist, and usually another couple for good measure. (All of the people in the group were interested in photography.) FE, took sandwiches, chocolate, fruit, things we could carry in our pockets, ice and a soft drink for after the hunt. We piled into a station wagon, as it seemed to hold more people and specimens. The day I remember particularly well because of the loot was the Provividencia Day. Providencia is an orphanage farm for small boys. It is a lovely place in the pines about seven miles from Josef Muench C re Q = w) \e) a es] esl Zz, " 392 town. In the main building we could get refreshments served by the Swiss in charge of the orphanage. The surrounding country is very much like our own mountain country in northern Arizona or New Mexico. Or, as a matter of fact, almost anywhere where there are pines and a scant undergrowth. 'The elevation is about thirty-five hundred feet. It seemed strange to hike through pines and oaks and suddenly come upon a banana plant or a palm tree. Otherwise we felt quite at home. At the beginning I felt rather dubious about the snake situation, but during the two years we were there I never saw a snake. Doubtless, there are many at lower altitudes. However, there were plenty of seed-ticks and red bugs—not harmful, but annoying beyond description. On Providencia Day we left the orphanage farm and took a trail through the pine woods. The naturalist was helpful in pointing RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 out new plants and birds. The Swiss explained the correct walking technique. (It was amazing how it worked and helped!) Frequently we took little side trails on our own, searching and discovering this and that. That day we heard a whistle from a distance and saw the naturalist walking rapidly towards us. When he reached us we asked him what had happened, what he had found. He was disturbingly calm and said, "Come along, I want to show you something magnifico!" We went down a path until we came to a hollow which looked like a deserted banana grove. We climbed through overgrown brush and tangled vines, down into the bananas. I imagined I could see little bright eyes peering at me, eyes of unknown creatures waiting to bite, sting, or wrap themselves around my body and squeeze me to death! Nothing happened. Then at the bottom of the grove we were told to turn around and look up. We saw a beautiful thing—a small ORCHID HUNTING IN HONDURAS cliff banked solidly with fragile white orchid blooms. Some had turned to yellow. We discovered later that although they remained fresh and firm, they turned yellow before they died. True to form it was almost impossible to reach them. However, we carried back a few specimens. They were identified later as "Estrella del mar'—Star of the Sea. We thought it a most satisfying day and relaxed contentedly over our refreshments in the orphanage patio. 'The Swiss lady in charge was exuberant about our discovery. She 393 probably knew where many other orchids were hidden which she had passed by on her numerous rides through the country by burro back. But she also knew it was much more fun and soul-satisfying to make these discoveries ourselves. P. S. When we were ready to leave the orphanage each of the women in the group was presented with a huge bunch of violets from the Swiss lady's own garden! _- Selective Memory Clarence Edwin Flynn For every hurt, and every wrong, And every discord in the song, And every stone and ugly weed, Memory should be poor indeed.

WESTMINSTER ABBEY: Poet's Corner—People usually enter the section of the abbey known as the "'poet's corner" at the door where the unfortunate Queen Caroline knocked in vain for admittance to the coronation of her husband, George IV, This section acquired its name from the fact of Chaucer's having been buried there, his monument having been the inaugural one. Among the most important monuments in this section, besides the one to Chaucer, are those of Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Goldsmith, Gray, Thompson Chapel of Saint Edmund—There isa great fascination in going in and out of the various chapels with their ancient tombs and windows. The sight acts like a spell upon the mind, carrying it into the remote past and causing the actors in former scenes to be present with us. JUNE Thou art here with thy garland of roses; Thou art here once again with thy song; Thou hast brought back the blue sky and sunshine The days so exquisite and long. —Mrs. H. IF. Thomas THE WAY TO REST: Many women never rest. 'They seem not to understand what rest, real rest, means. To throw one's self down with a newspaper or book is not to rest; it is only a change of occupation. To sit down and keep the fingers flying over some sort of fancy work, as if one were pursued by a demon of unrest, is certainly not rest. But to lie at full length on a hard surface; arms extended at the sides, head back, with no pillow, eyes closed, all cares, and worries dismissed—this is rest; this will smooth away wrinkles in the face and in temper; this will give an air of repose to the tired, anxious nervous woman; this will take away many an ache and straighten out the rounded shoulders and craned out necks. SEVIER STAKE: The Relicf Society Conference of this stake was held in the Relicf Socicty Hall in the second ward, Richficld, March 15, 1889, commencing at 10 A. M. On the platform were President E. Bean and her counselors, Jane Spencer, and Theresa Thurber, and several other presidents of branches m the Stake. President Bean said that we had in a way been left to ourselves; the day had come for us to exert our energies and act for ourselves; that we had enjoyed many privileges and we had not appreciated them fully. "Some day these blessings might be taken away from us and we would miss them." We should set a good example for our children.—Chnistina Sellers, Secretary age 294 rPHERE are approximately one hundred women veterinarians 'n the United States.

Whenever you go on a vacation, look for unusual branches, stumps, rocks, and grasses. Here is a hobby for the whole family to engage in together. Make a collection. For instance, instead of speeding across our Utah desert at an unsafe rate, stop once in awhile, get out and walk around a bit. Look especially where vegetation is having a hard time surviving. Usually in windswept areas or on extremely sandy or rocky hillsides—anywhere nature is having a difficult time—you will find the grotesque and weird-shaped branches and trees that are so tremendously interesting. Watch for them! The writer, in company with his entire family, spent two very enjoyRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 able afternoons, tramping the desert southwest of Tooele, Utah. It would be hard to say who enjoyed the outing most, the grownups, or the children, whose keen imaginations were given free play. How delighted they were to discover some twisted branch or weird-shaped stump and proudly add it to our collection. Even the baby seemed to know that some unusual pastime was in progress. My mother, who is of an age when many women pre: fer to sit at home, had a sparkle in her eye, as she picked up such objects as pieces of gnarled native cedar to represent her contribution to our store. We returned home with a wonderful assortment to add to our pleasure and that of our friends for many days to come. The accompanying _ illustration TABLE SETTINGS AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS 401 shows a fine specimen, exactly as it was picked up on our jaunt. This branch illustrates perfectly the principle of informal balance. Can't you just picture it mounted on a plaster of Paris base and set in a large window with ivy or philodendron twining around it? OW as to the actual arranging of flowers. Remember it is always desirable to incorporate some accent into the design. It is like a dress. The dress that is remembered is the one with some sort of accent. It gives character to the dress and likewise, accent gives character to the flower arrangement. Usually the best accent flowers are those that grow in tall spikes, such as snapdragons, stocks, glads, heather, Liatris, and the like, many of which are to be found in our gardens. In the absence of a spike flower, one may be improvised by tying or witing flowers together as a garland to resemble a spike. Much has been written about "line" arrangements in flowers, and the term has been unnecessarily shrouded in mystery. Many people have told me: "Oh I couldn't do a line arrangement." Yet they go ahead and make a design and, without knowing it, use an adaptation of this principle. 'There is really nothing difficult about it. A "line" design is merely any arrangement that falls into dominant or accent lines. 'The beginner, placing asters loosely in a bowl usually makes a fine effect. She uses the "line of the circle." Of more character than the line of the circle are those of the vertical, the horizontal, and various combina- 402 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 TABLE SETTINGS AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS tions or adaptations of these two. The principal idea to keep in mind with any arrangement of dominant lines is to keep them flowing, graceful, and spontaneous, never set, rigid, or stiff. One particular form, which is not only interesting but is capable of innumerable variations, ls the line of the asymmetrical triangle. 'The accompanying diagrammatic illustrations show various adaptations of this informal arrangement. 'The diagrams show what would be twigs, branches, or flowers. In actual practice, however, the materials used are seldom found as illustrated but must be cut, bent, and arranged to conform to the desired effect. 'The drawings not only illustrate the principle of dominant lines but serve to show how balance achieved. (Note the effectiveness of may be 403 placing the pin frog "off center" when using a low, shallow bowl.) Much could be said, if space would permit, about the containers in which we place flowers. Do not be afraid to sharply accent. Make dominant lines really bold, leaving no doubt as to their dominance. One good rule to follow is to make your accent a minimum of one and half times the height or length of the container. A florist often uses lines as much as two or three times the dimensions of the container. If any part of the above discussion confuses you, please don't despaitr! Keep trying. Don't lose interest. Learn to experiment. Above all, don't make flower arranging a chore. It should always be on the light-hearted side. Please have fun with your flowers.

Pressed Flower Pictures—a ''Desj ning'' sning Hobby Mina Hartvigsen Wright, Murray, Utah, Creates Lasting Beauty by Arranging Flowers in Frames "MAKING pressed flower pictures is only one of my hobbies," Mrs. Wright ex. Plains, "but it challenges the skill of my fingers and the reaches of my mind." The possible patterns and combinations of form and color are infinite, but all of Mrs. Wright's "floral portraits"' reveal gtacefulness, expert blending of tones and tints, as well as striking and unique contrasts. In addition to the methods used by many hobbyists, Mrs. Wright experiments with tinting petals and coloring the delicate network of veins in the blossoms. She is an expert at the exacting art of sand pressing. Her designs have won many prizes and awards, including a certificate of honor presented by the Utah Centennial Committee in 1947. Between the newspapers. For weights she uses an old anvil, a pan of nails, or any other heavy material which will exert sufficient pressure. Page 404 PRESSED FLOWER PICTURES 405 When the flowers have been gathered and pressed ready for assembling and designing into "portraits" Mrs. Wright prepares the picture frames and mounting materials. For the foundation of the portrait she uses heavy, smooth cardboard, padded with cheesecloth and covered with silk, satin, or taffeta in cream white or some pastel tint. The flowers are attached to the mounting with liquid paste. A masonite back is used to protect the picture from breakage and to seal it against dust and smoke. Mrs. Wright, in spite of being crippled since childhood, lives a full and useful life. At the age of five she suffered a fall which broke her back and from which she has never fully recovered. Very early in her childhood she Icarned to make yarn flowers and mount them on velvet and under glass. She made tissue-paper flowers; she tinted modeling clay and used it for many arts, making flowers, figurines, and picture frames. She also learned dressmaking, quilt and rugmaking, and various types of handwork. A musician and organist of ability, Mrs. Wright is also a poet, having written over two hundred original compositions. In Church work her particular interest is genealogy, and at home her large family, six sons and a daughter, make life interesting and eventful. "What a privilege is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," Mrs. Wright often remarks, for she has found the world wide and wonderful, and she endeavors to share her talents and her accomplishments with others. Inner Resources Caroline Eyring Miner a you are mature, you will be able to entertain yourself as well as others." 'This is a wise bit of philosophy I heard once long before I understood its complete meaning. Experience has clarified it. I recall a neighbor of mine who did not seem to be able to do anything alone. If she was to make pies, she came for me or got another of her neighbors to peel apples with her. She wanted to help me do my washing and then have me help her so that we could be together. She did not seem to be able to spend an evening or even an hour by herself. When her husband and son were away, as they frequently were, she was always hatching up some excuse for a small party. "How that woman must hate herself," my husband said once, impatiently. "No, it isn't exactly that," I said, "she hasn't the inner reserves or resources that make herself worthy of entertaining herself. She hasn't developed fascinating hobbies, reading, fancywork, playing a musical instrument, writing poems, which might give her something to say to and to do with herself when she is alone. And so she makes an evil out of the fine quality of neighborliness by doing it to death." And what a pity it is, for sooner or later, one will have occasion to be thrown upon one's own resources—in prolonged illness, in living in isolated areas—maybe in sheer defense when one's neighbors have grown weary of too much neighboring. It would be well for all of us to take stock of our own resources, our ability to entertain ourselves. If we could say with the poet, "I'm the best friend that I ever had; I like to be with me," how rich we would be; emotionally, how mature. A Family's a Family Estelle Webb Thomas RS. Damon laid down the M letter and glanced around the breakfast table at the assortment of faces turned toward her, expectantly. "My goodness!" she murmured, helplessly. 'There was an instant of silence. Mr. Damon cleared his throat. "When did you say they are coming?" he inquired. "Tonight!" Mrs. Damon glanced at the letter for confirmation, hoping she had misread it, but knowing she hadn't. "Yes, tonight, the tenth. You see, the letter was delayed." "Read it again!" Aunt Janey demanded, "I don't rightly know what you're talking about!" She cupped her hand behind her ear and leaned nearer, busily chewing, as she listened. Mrs. Damon picked up the letter again and obligingly shouted, "I'll just read what he says about coming: So, I'm bringing her home to meet the family. She has about everything else in the world, but she doesn't have any relatives. There's where I have the advantage of her. Maybe a real, live family —and I do mean live, will help me to sell myself to her. "And he says she's an orphan— raised in boarding schools!" Curtis, the fifteen-year-old, said, wonderingly. "What's he trying to do, shock the poor girl to death!" "Oh, Curt!" Mrs. Damon's tone reproached him, but she added, doubtfully, "but I do wonder what she'll think of us?" "She'll think I'm a fine figure of Page 406 a man!" Mr. Damon complacently patted his billowing waistline. "Prob'ly can't see the man for the figger!'" Aunt Janey snapped, in one of her unexpectedly sharp moments. Mr. Damon laughed, goodnaturedly. "Well, Aunt Janey, it cost too much to put it there, for me to want to lose any of it!" he yelled. "See how proud Dale is of you all!" Mrs. Damon said, quickly, forestalling another comment by Aunt Janey, "I hope you'll do him credit!" "His memory must be failing," Curt observed, cynically. "I remember when he wanted to keep us a secret from his girls." "Oh, Curt, it wasn't that!" his mother protested. "It was just that he wanted you smaller ones to sort of grow on people, gradually." "Couldn't we have the twins and Mike in bed when they get here?" Natalie suggested. Natalie was seventeen and, since she was in love most of the time, thought she could understand Dale's situation better than anyone else. "Let them grow on her gradually, as you say." "But she'd be bound to find out about them next morning!" Mrs. Damon sighed. "And they're so bouncy mormings!" Natalie said, hopelessly. "We could give them sleeping pills—" Curt began, when the twins and Michael, who had been engaged in a quiet game of toast stealing while the grown-ups' attention was absorbed, suddenly woke up to A FAMILY'S A FAMILY the fact the conversation concerned them. "Jeepers!" Patty shouted, "what are we, smallpox or something? What've we done now?" "Yes, what've we done, now?" Penny echoed. Mike, hastily swallowing Penny's toast, wiped his mouth and _ assumed the angelic expression which was his assurance against accusation —just or unjust. "I've done nothing," he said, Dlandly. "Murder will out!" Aunt Janey pronounced, grimly, scraping her cereal bowl. "And Dale actually wants to exhibit these—" Curt began again, but Mr. Damon interrupted, sternly, "That will do, Curtis! If Dale is proud enough of the family to bring his girl all the way from Chicago to meet us, why should you feel so differently?" "T don't know, Dad," Curtis considered the question gravely, "there are some old adages that might explain it. 'Distance lends enchantment,' is one, and 'Absence makes the heart grow fonder, | imagine it's the latter that applies to Dale's case. Nothing could lend enchantment to our kids." "Well, as I allus say,' remarked Aunt Janey, apropos of nothing, "There's just as good fish in the sea as was ever caught." "PT HANK goodness, it's Saturday," Mrs. Damon said, rising briskly. "You can all help get ready for them. We do want to do Dale proud, bless his heart. I mustn't forget to start those rolls he asks for in his postscript. Let's see—Natalie, I'll tum the living room over 407 to you." She turned distractedly to the twins. "You girls do your room, and do it well! But first, wash the dishes. And do keep your eyes on Michael! Michael!" Mike, who had been sneaking out, turned slowly back. "Gather up all your toys, from the hall and everywhere and take them up to the attic." Mike's angelic smile faded, "But what'll I play with?" he whined. "Get outside and play like a boy!" Curt said, impatiently. "You're too big to play with toys all the time." Mike threw back his shoulders and looked every one of his six years. ""That's right!" he said, finding the suggestion good. "And you, Curtis," Mrs. Damon went inexorably on, "please shake all the rugs and hang them on the line, till we get the floors waxed." Curtis, who thought she had forgotten him and was trying to slip away to his workshop in the attic, reluctantly shuffled into the living room. "I didn't have time to shave this morning," Mr. Damon said, hastily snatching his hat and coat. "Will it be too much to hope that I can have the bathroom for a brief period this evening?" Without waiting for an answer, he dashed into the hall and, a moment Iater, a heavy thud brought the family on a run to see him scrambling up off the floor. "Where's that Mike?" he shouted, wrathfully, "he—I'll—that's the last time I'l ever slip on that thing!" He kicked a bright, red dump truck viciously across the hall. "Are you hurt, John?" Mrs, Damon asked, anxiously, as she stooped 408 automatically to pick up the offending truck. "No thanks to that kid if ''m not," her husband muttered, "and put that toy right back where it was! He'll never learn to put his toys away, so long as you do it for him!" Mrs. Damon meekly replaced the truck and looked vaguely around for Michael. He seemed to have disappeared, but she could hear the twins upstairs, loudly cleaning their room. Probably he was with them or Curt. Aunt Janey was calling and she hurried away. When Curtis had finally retreated to his attic laboratory, Mrs. Damon again missed Michael. She took her hands out of the dough and went to the foot of the stairs. "Curtis! Is Michael with you?" An indistinguishable murmur answered her. "Well, send him down to pick up his toys," she called, and went back to finish mixing her rolls and plan the rest of her dinner. At 11:30, she called Natalie, "I must run downtown, dear. Aunt Janey wants some yarn matched, and you know how she is—doesn't think you could possibly do it right! Besides, I think P'll ask Esther for her recipe for shrimp salad, it's better than mine. Fix the children some soup and crackers, will you, and take Aunt Janey a tray? And please get Michael out of the attic and see that he picks up his toys!' She hurried away, skirting the dump truck, still in the hall. T' was inevitable that there should be callers that afternoon. Mrs. Damon laughed and chatted, inwardly seething. Nothing was being made ready for the visitors. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 Natalie, who had started to make her room immaculate, for Elyse must share it with her, was crosslegged on the floor, deep in old letters, as she always ended up when she tackled her vanity drawers. Curt was presumably in his laboratory, as always when he had his way, and from their shrieks and laughter, it was evident the twins were sprinkling the lawn and particularly each other. The dough for the rolls was booming over the pan's edge, when the guests finally took their leave. "Look out for the dump truck!" Mrs. Daman Called, just in time to save fat Mrs. Boris a bad fall. "I have to leave it for Michael to pick up— his father's orders." "Where is Michael?" she cried, a few minutes later, "I can't remember when I saw him last!" Feeling suddenly terribly uneasy, she ran into Natalie's room. "Nat, where's Michael? Where did he go after lunch?" f "He wasn't here for lunch, Mothet." Natalie looked up, absently. "Didn't he go with you?" "Curtis!" shrieked Mrs. Damon, running to the foot of the stairs, "fs Mike with you?" "I haven't seen Mike since breakfast," Curtis answered, crossly. "I was right in the middle—" "Oh, my baby! Oh, gracious, where is he?" Mrs. Damon's anguished cry brought the other children running. In a few minutes, sobered and anxious, they had scattered in search of him, and Mrs. Damon was frantically telephoning her husband. At six o'clock, Curtis came in with the vagrant, followed, during A FAMILY'S A FAMILY the next half hour, by the other detachments of the searchers, returning, wearily, to report failure. Aunt Janey, who had Temained unmoved throughout the entire affair, ow commented oracularly, "Don't I always say, a bad penny will return?" Michael, it transpired, had taken Curt's suggestion that he play like a boy, literally. He had wandered into the streets, joined a gang going fishing, or rather been allowed fo tag along, been dared to go swimming, and almost drowned in the icy water, before one of the boys had discovered he knew very little about swimming. The frightened boys had tried to send him home then, and Michael had been quite ready to go. He was hungry and cold and dirty. The only thing that had prevented his going straight home was that he did not know where his home was. Suddenly, he was an adventurer no longer, but a little boy, barely six, with lots of nice toys at home and a mother it seemed he had not seen for years. He had begun to cry, standing by the dusty road, rublittle face. Picked him up and was trying, at a gas station on the outskirts of town, to find where the Damons lived, when Curt caught sight of Mike's dirt-streaked face behind an enormous hamburger, and had claimed him. Curt and Mike arrived home shortly before the twins, who were almost as disreputable looking as Mike—limp and dejected, hair ribbons lost and hair flying loose. Vic- 409 tims of conscience because they had not "looked out" for Michael, they dragged in, so sure he was kidnapped and lost forever that, at sight of his filthy, smug little face, they began to howl, with mingled relief and anger, that he had made them suffer so. There were more tears from Mts. Damon and Natalie a few minutes later and a few forceful remarks from Mr. Damon before he hurried into the bathroom, declaring he was going to get his shaving over before cleaning operations began on those kids. RS. Damon was in the kitchen starting the delayed dinner, when his voice rang through the house, iritably demanding quiet. "I can't even hear myself shave in this racket!" he yelled. "Hear yourself shave?" Mrs. Damon shouted back. She was in the midst of shaping her rolls and couldn't run as she usually did at his call. "Certainly!" he stuck his lathered face through the bathroom doorway. "Didn't you know I had to learn to shave by ear? Curt is always taking the light bulb for his pesky workroom and leaving the socket empty!" Still grumbling, he disappeared into the bathroom. "Oh, dear!" Mrs. Damon despaired of making Curt hear through the hubbub. Let John shave by ear and get out of the bathroom so Natalie could start on the children before Dale and Elyse arrived. It was at this inauspicious moment that the front door was thrown open and a joyous shout of, "Hi, folks!' Here's—" followed by two heavy thuds, brought everyone, in- 410 cluding Mr. Damon, with one side of his face lathered, to the front hall. On the floor, flat on his back, lay Dale and sprawled across him, a girl who was pretty even in that ridiculous position. In the excitement of finding Michael, someone had kicked the dump truck back into the middle of the hall. Mr. Damon, looking like a onesided Santa Claus, and Curtis helped the embarrassed couple to their feet, and Dale, laughing and rather red-faced, began introductions. He hesitated when he came to the three younger ones, as if he could scarcely recognize the little tramps; but went manfully on, "And this pair, Patty and Penny, better known as the Gruesome Twosome or Double Trouble, and Mike—" "An angel with a dirty face!" Michael put in dimpling. He felt quite a hero as the cause of so much commotion and, remembering that Natalie had so designated him in a moment of weakness, thought it would help to establish his status with Elyse. "It never rains but it pours, I allus say," Aunt Janey pronounced, ambiguously, when she was introduced. With such a start for the visit, Mrs. Damon feared the worst. But the children, evidently feeling they had done their worst, were almost models of propriety. Michael did ask Elyse, earnestly, if she thought Daddy was a fine figger of a man and Patty repeated Aunt Janey's trenchant comment. Penny then volunteered the information that Mother would probably be a fine figure of a woman if she didn't RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 do bendings all the time, and at the mental picture of Mother's "bendings," she and Patty had such an attack of giggles they had to be sent away from the table. There was another awkward moment when Aunt Janey, chewing vigorously with her front teeth, stared balefully over her glasses at Elyse and stated, cryptically, "Well, pretty is as pretty does, I allus say. These lapses were quickly covered by the adult and aware members of the family, but Mr. Damon's tone was hollowly hearty and Mrs. Damon was frankly flustered. Even Natalie and Curt, with all the aplomb of modern youth, felt they were fighting a lost cause. Dale watched Elyse anxiously, trying to see behind her polite, smiling mask, giving the others piteous glances that begged, come on now, please show her how nice you can really be! But when the children were sent to bed, loudly protesting that it was still early, the sense of sitting on top of an active volcano somewhat abated, although there was. Still Aunt Janey to be reckoned with. Mrs. Damon tactfully suggested that the travelers must be weary and, as soon as was decently possible, everyone retired. ALE breathed a huge sigh of relef when the last good night was said. He lingered a moment alone in the livingroom, trying to get back the joy that reunion with the family usually brought. But he could not help seeing the children through Elyse's eyes. Elyse, who had never known any home, but fashionable boarding schools, would un- A FAMILY'S A FAMILY doubtedly classify them as brats and Aunt Janey as a "character." At that, the children had been tired and, for them, subdued during the evening. He shuddered at the thought of morning, when, refreshed and full of good will, they would take over the entertainment of the guest. Thank goodness, there would be a few hours respite before they must be coped with again. But he had congratulated himself too soon. In the hall, the pajama-clad twins were just completing a transaction whereby they had sold Elyse, whom they had waylaid en route to bed, a dollar's worth of garden seeds to help their "school projeck." They were highly indignant when he caught them on the stairs and tried to gently reprove them. Patty said if he thought that was bad what about Elyse washing her face in the pitch dark because Curt had forgotten to put back the bulb. And then, when he was just sinking into uneasy slumber, a terrified shriek had brought him upright again and he had realized, with a sinking heart, that it came from Nat's room. It seemed that when the two girls had turned out the light and climbed into bed, Elyse, with an involuntary scream, had jumped right out again. Down. Under the covers, where he had crawled from the pillow, was Mike's pet horned toad, Galahad, every bit as frightened and upset as Elyse. Then, between a wild desire to laugh and humiliation, Dale and Natalie assured Elyse this was not a piece of cruel mischief, but simply a love offering and proof of how deeply Mike had fallen for her, since no- 411 one else was ever allowed to touch Galahad. Quiet, like a much disturbed bird, once more settled cautiously over the house. The girls finished their desultory conversation and were drifting off to sleep when a resounding bumpety-bump jarred the ceiling directly over their heads. That Curt, Nat thought, angrily, was big enough to know better. Evi. Dently he had not gone to bed but was still working in his stupid laboratory, and had carelessly dropped something. She slipped out of bed and quietly tiptoed from the room. Why the quiet, she did not know except to keep up the fiction that Elyse was asleep. She was ashamed of making excuses. She jetked the attic door open and hissed, "I heard you trying to knock the house down and thought it was in very poor taste!" Curt looked up innocently from his notebook, "Oh, you mean when I accidently pushed all those books off the table?" "Was that what it was? I thought you'd dropped a ton of brick. Elyse nearly jumped out of bed!" "Elyse better take something for her nerves, if she's going to be one of us," Curt murmured, breathlessly. "Don't you kids ever settle down, day or night?" Dale stood at the foot of the stairs, his face strained and disillusioned. "I thought we used to have fairly peaceful nights, anyway." He turned back into his room, and the two stared at each other with stricken faces. Natalie's eyes filled with tears and even Cur. Tis' monumental calm was shaken. "IT guess we've kind of let him down," he muttered, as they crept down the stairs. 412 ARLY next morning, Dale knocked purposefully on Natalie's door. "Nat, tell Elyse we'll have to be going, if she's to catch the seventhirty train!" he called. "But, Dale—" he had gone into the kitchen, however, where his mother was starting _ breakfast. 'Mother, could Elyse and I have a bite before the others get up, so I can get her to the seven-thirty?" Mrs. Damon turned a bewildered face, "But Dale, I thought—" "No, shell be going back this morning," Dale interrupted, bleakly. "Ill stay on for a week," he added, turning away. His manner forbade questioning and, puzzled and depressed, his mother began setting the table. She had had the impression they were both staying a week and going back together. Well, maybe she had misunderstood. Elyse made a mere pretense of eating, as did Dale, and bade Mrs. Damon a subdued goodbye. Her face was as pale and strained as Dale's and they drove to the depot in absolute silence. Silently, too, Dale carried her suitcases to the station platform and _ then stiffly held out his hand. "Well, goodbye, Elyse. I hope you'll forgive me. I certainly was a fool, but it's better you found out now than when it was too late." "But, Dale—" Elyse began, but he held up his hand. "Never mind making excuses, Elyse. I know just how the family appeared to you. I think I actually saw them through your eyes. I can see how those kids would seem to a gitl raised like you've been. Id RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 sort of forgotten how impossible they are." "Listen, Dale—"' "Wait! I want to apologize for bringing you here, and for thinking, even for a minute, you could ever be happy with that—that three-ring circus—" "Dale—" "Or with me either. I'm not trying to pretend I'm not one of them. To be perfectly honest, I get a big kick out of those kids. If they'd change, I'd be disappointed as—I'd be disappointed. It's just that— well, we're not your kind of people!" Elyse said, coldly, "If you're quite through, Dale, may I say something before the train leaves?" "Sure! Come night out with what you think of them. I won't be offended!" "All right, I will! Except it's what I think of you, Dale Damon! I think you're the smuggest, most selfish boy I ever knew! Rushing me off after one night, when you'd invited me for a week! Giving me the brush-off without any explanation! What did I do?" "You?" Dale stammered, "Why, nothing, but Elyse—" "Shut up!" Elyse snapped, furiously. "You can't do all the talking, you know, even if you are the only one with a family—a background—"' She choked and Dale said, in a bewildered tone, "But those kids, Aunt Janey—I could just hear you telling your friends about them—" "T wonder if you could, really?" Elyse asked, in a curious voice. "Since you have so good an imagination, try imagining what it is never to have a soul of your own to talk about. 'To always have to sit A FAMILY'S A FAMILY mum when the others rattle on about their folks! To never get a letter or a package from home? Sure, I was going to talk about them! I was going to bring them into the conversation every time I got a chance! They were going to be mine, you selfish prig! My Gruesome 'I'wosome, my funny Aunt Janey, my darling little Mike, my—" Her voice had grown higher and higher, and now she broke into hysterical sobs and started blindly for the train door. Dale set down her luggage and seized her arm. "Elyse, wait—" Elyse jerked away. "Leave me alone you—you—" A stocky policeman, who had been watching them from a distance, stepped nearer and said, in a low, but menacing tone, "Leave the 413 lady alone, buddy, and stop bothering her, see!" Dale turned a haughty stare on him. "Tll do no such thing! She's trying to run out on the family. I admit they're a pill, but after all, a family's a family!" "Oh, my mistake!"' the policeman acknowledged, rather embarrassed. He turned to Elyse. "Sure thing! You got a family, lady, you got 'em. They get onto your nerves, sure, but you just can't take a powder! Might iP? As well face it! Elyse turned back and lifted teardrenched eyes to Dale's, a tremulous smile breaking over her face, like the sun through rain. "He's right, Dale! I've got me a family and I'm simply not going to take a powder! You might as well face it." Rescue That Little Rocker Rachel K. Laurgaard N how many junk-filled attics does Grandmother's little, old sewing rocker stand forlornly gathering dust and cobwebs, its cane seat poked through, awaiting the coming of the itinerant chair-mender, who will never pass this way again! Sometimes it rocks dejectedly on the back porch through sunshine and through rain until, falling apart, it is tossed on the woodpile or carried off by the junkman. Such a pity it is for this quaint piece to come to so neglected an end, when it might still grace a fireside or add charm to a period bedroom! No piece of solid wood furniture is ever in too hopeless a state to be refinished or repaired. 'True, the upholstery may be worn and soiled —tear it off and throw it away. The pretty natural markings of its wood may be concealed by layers of dark varnish and paint—scrape them off. A few hours of effort and a little application of elbow grease will reward you with a chair of which you can well be proud. To transform the rocker, you will need a can of paint and varnish remover, a putty knife or scraper, a file for the rungs and corners where the paint clings so tenaciously, sandpaper, boiled linseed oil, and turpentine., First, spread plenty of newspapers down and go after the old finish. 414 If your chair has been painted and repainted several times, it may take a couple of coats of paint remover to get it clean. The more work you let the paint remover do, the less work there will be for the sandpaper—and you. Scrape off the gummy paint with the putty knife, being careful not to gouge the wood. Dry it off thoroughly, and file and sandpaper it smooth. Some woods are softer and easier to work with than others, If you are lucky enough to have a walnut chair, you can get a smooth satiny finish in a comparatively short time. Maple and oak are harder. Always sandpaper with the grain. Coarse sandpaper will gouge walnut, but you may have to resort to it on badly scarred maple or oak. But be careful! Coarse sandpaper cuts deeply. A medium grade is the safest, and, for the final smoothing, use only the very finest. F your little rocker has become unglued or broken, you will probably find it more convenient to send it Out fo a fix-it shop for repairs. Furniture clamps are a necessity for a good job of re-gluing. Sometimes, however, it is an easy matter to glue a loose joint or two and. By means RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 of a well-placed screw, hold them securely. Small metal angles or flat sttips with holes for screws can be used to advantage to strengthen the seat from beneath. Now for the finishing process! If the wood is walnut, use walnut oil stain sparingly, and after that has dried, walnut wood filler, to fill the pores. When this has set for the required length of time, rub in a mix. Ture of boiled linseed oil and turpentine—two-thirds linseed oil to onethird turpentine. The finest of hand-rubbed furniture has a finish Impervious to water, achieved by the application of several coats of oil, with light sandpaper between cach coat. In fact, if you have real patience, eliminate the stain entirely and darken the wood slowly by rubbing in repeated coats of oil. However, if you wish to finish your little rocker quickly, two coats of oil are enough, with a good coat of liquid floor wax to top it off. Oak, maple, birch, and any others of the lighter woods are very nice finished in their natural color without benefit of stain. With oak, an oak filler may be used to seal the pores, or you may merely oil and wax it. Maple and birch are so RESCUE THAT LITTLE ROCKER close-grained that they don't need a filler. OUR little rocker is now ready for its covering. If it was in a good state of repair and had never had other covering than the caning, you may like to have it re-caned. This, of course, is the authentic thing to do and, perhaps in your community, there is an elderly cabinet-maker who, in his youth, learned the almost extinct art of caning. But cane seats are perishable, unfortunately, and long before your little rocker was relegated to the attic, it probably had a succession of makeshift seats tacked onto it. If such is the case, and there are many nail holes close to the caning holes, it will be better to fill them with plastic wood and do an upholstering job. This will not be difficult. Five yards of upholsterer's webbing, and plenty of tacks will do the trick. Fold the ends of two or three strips of the webbing, depending on the size of the seat, along the front, as close to the inside edge as possible, without danger of splitting or weakening the wood. Pull each strip so tight it twangs. 'Turn under and tack similarly to the back edge. Then attach three more strips to one side, 415 weave them through the first three strips, and attach firmly to the other side. 'The tighter the webbing is stretched, the less sag will develop in the seat. Do the back in a like mannet. Now stretch a piece of burlap or canvas over the webbing and tack down. If you can, use horsehair or upholster's moss for padding, especially for the seat. Old horsehair should be washed and dried in the sun to restore its springiness. But any sort of cotton batting will do very well and, in case you do use hair or moss, be sure to cover it with a layer of cotton so that it won't poke through the cover. Remember that the stuffing will pack down considerably, so use plenty of it, and cover this with muslin. Needlepoint or tapestry may be tacked on with small upholsterer's tacks, with matching braid glued around the edge, and caught with a curved needle and thread. Brassheaded tacks make a neat finish, too. Ruffled calico or chintz is best sewed onto the muslin cover, to make it easily removable for washing. There now, aren't you proud of your handiwork! And can't you just see Grandmother's eyes light up as she sees you rocking in her little chair? ___OoOO Oo —- --——— CARROT MARMALADE Submitted by Frances Kolarik 4 large carrots 4 lernons Grate the carrots and slice the lemons thin.

Stewart CHAPTER 6 Synopsis: Joanna, who had married David Niels against the wishes of her family, is left a widow with four children to support and care for. Courageously, she takes inventory of her meager resources and plans for the future. A neighbor gives her a sack of navy beans and Joanna decides to make Boston-baked beans for sale. Another neighbor, Abigail Smith, offers to help with ideas and transportation.. From a slow and unpromising beginning, they build a profitable business. Joanna rears her children with love and devotion and, after years of careful saving, she plans to buy a house on a hill. A real estate salesman, Kent Taylor, takes Joanna to see a house he has for sale. The chill air. Everything seemed different. Not just another autumn, this had a secret exciting something in it, as if the days had something special to give her. He turned up the hill that led toward the Capitol. "This is the best way to get to the house the long way around." "But I'm so busy," Joanna answered breathlessly, "besides, I have to be home by three-thirty. The children get out of school then, and you must have a lot of customers waiting." He said loftily, ""They are Mother's. Let 'em wait. Besides they are all very old, or fat, or... Anyway, this is a lot more fun." Laughter began a slow growing in Joanna, not the ready laughter she had for her children, or the neighborly laughter for Abigail's tart comments, but a laughter from Page 416 Jthe" took a deep breath of deep within, as when winter withdraws, foot by foot, and spring begins her tasks. It was like that, as though her heart had been enclosed in ice and was now breaking free. The house was an old one, but well-built. It stood high up from the street, and was reached by climbing a flight of stairs. Lawns sloped sharply to the street. The porch was in need of paint, but it was wide and long, plenty of space for Sally and Michael and their friends. The living room was long, too. It boasted a window seat. Against the east wall was a brick fireplace, painted white to match the woodwork. The floors were hardwood, recently sanded and waxed. Joanna caught her breath when she saw the dining room. It had such possibilities. Stairs ran up the west wall to the second floor; under the high east windows were shelves. The paper was beautifully patterned, green leaves and traceries, giving the effect of summer sun and cheerful shade. Joanna touched the paper with gentle finger tips. She looked up to find Kent Taylor's eyes on her and she blushed. She went on tiptoe into the kitchen, because suddenly their footsteps seemed very loud in the deserted house. There was an electric range. She turned to Kent Taylor, who leaned against the door. He nodded. "It goes with the house. There's a stoker downstairs, youll never have to carry another bucket of coal." JOANNA She looked down at her hands. They were gloved, but he must have noticed them. This morning, the coal dust ground into the skin. She looked out the back door. No blackened sheds, with coal dust marking a path to the door, but a white-painted garage and roses and lilac bushes around the green lawn, a peach and a chery tree to give shade as well as fruit. "I know it's going to cost more then I can pay," Joanna said. There was a bedroom downstairs and three upstairs. Joanna wove her dreams. She would take the downstairs bedroom, share it with Sally. The big bedroom, upstairs, opened onto a little screened porch. Penny would love that. David could have the next larger bedroom, and Michael would like the small one with the sloping ceiling. She turned to Kent Taylor. "But I have so little... Not enough. Not nearly enough." He whistled regretfully, "They are asking quite a little down." He helped her down the stairs. "But there is always a way to raise money." She said, wonderingly, "What on earth do you do for a living that would lead you to make a statement like that?" He grinned. His hair was very red in the sun, and she could sce the freckles spattering his skin. "I'm a writer... Of articles. That's how I know that something always turns up." "I won't borrow for a down payment," He helped her into the car and slid under the wheel. "Somehow I knew you would say that. You're 417 There's >) different, Mrs. Niels. Something about you. E told her about himself on the drive home. He was thirty-six, her age. Joanna stole a look at the blunt profile. He seemed so much younger than she, and there was no difference in their years. He had been married. She had died of injuries suffered in an accident. Kent Taylor ran his hands around the steering wheel. "T've never been able to tell anyone before, the horror of it. She was so young, so beautiful, so alive. It was strange to watch her die, the hot, quick life pouring out of her in the red flood they couldn't stop. It made me know what an enemy life is. Not to be trusted. It makes me realize what an idiot a man can be to dream. Dreams, fragile as china, as easily broken." He stared straight ahead. "Well, I've done. A good job of keeping a hop, skip, and a jump ahead of life. I'm never giving it another chance to get at me." Joanna looked at her worn gloves and listened to him. He spoke of places he had been. The glamorous names slipped lightly from his tongue, and Joanna could see him moving among the fabulous people, his red hair like a bright banner, his easy laughter winning friends on every side, and always that secret armor to keep out those who would come too close. She was sorry when they reached home. It was like stepping out of a brightly lighted world into a drab, familiar room. The little house seemed more battered than eVEr, smaller; the fence sagged. For the first time, Joanna knew a rebellion 418 against closing the door and donning the flat, comfortable shoes, poured out of the house to greet her. Penny, slim and cage, brought up the rear, "Did you find it, Mother? Did you find our house?" "All yours?" Kent asked. Joanna put her arms around Michael and Sally. "All mine." She saw the cloud obscure, for a brief moment, his laughter. "Crown jewels," he said, and the twinkle was back. " 'm_ Connie's Uncle Kent," he said to Penny. He reached in his pocket for the keys and held them out to Joanna. "Just ly on the head. 'Tll come tomor. Tow." Work can wait," he said. It's a crime not to see more of these autumn days." When he had gone the children besieged her with questions. Abigail came running over. "Where have you been? Orders have been pourIng in," Joanna chuckled. "All right, ''m y, "Td to own it.
