Of its forty-five paid members, twenty-eight are student-wives, who exemplify compassionate service, for they help each other in sickness and share each other's burdens, sorrows, and joys, with the same crusading spirit as their pioneer ancestors. Their youth and enthusiasm, despite financial hardships and crowded housing facilities, have written a new and heroic chapter in Relief Society history."

Right now, I've a thousand things to do." Only to Abigail did she confide the reason. "I'd look a fright, just that old gray suit, and that older dress. My hair is a fright." Abigail sniffed.

I have something of the greatest importance " He tapped his breast pocket significantly. Joanna smothered her laughter. "Come right in. I'm afraid you'll have to sit in the kitchen. I was just baking some cakes." He followed her in, moving lightly on his small, brilliantly shined shoes. He sat gingerly in the chair and put his hat under it.

And how a kindly neighbor brought you a sack of beans he had been given, and how you started your little business with his gift." Joanna laughed and rolled her hands in her apron. "Oh, no, Mr. Parkinson... I couldn't do that." He chuckled with her. "I rather thought you would say that. But did you ever think of the women you could help...?
