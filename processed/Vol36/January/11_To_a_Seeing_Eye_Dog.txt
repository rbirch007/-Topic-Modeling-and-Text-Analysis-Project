h the years of tragedy and testing, the Prophet—God-inspired and protected—came with heroic stature. Trusted friends at times failed him, yet others stood the searching test and became stalwarts for the carrying forward of the work of the Lord. And some eminent ones who strayed away returned humbly to the fold. Among the treasured memories of William M. Frampton, father of Eva Frampton Driggs, wife of the writer, is the following story, written as this brother told it: When I was seventeen years of age living with my mother, Laura Farnsworth Frampton, near old Kanesville, Iowa, J] went one Sabbath with her to the old meeting house in that frontier town. Apostle Orson Hyde was presiding. A stranger was on the stand with him. After the opening exercises and the administering of the Sacrament, Apostle Hyde arose, and gave us all a spiritual thrill, by introducing the stranger—one who had played a most helpful part in the restoring of the Gospel of these latterdays—his friend and associate through earlier years, Oliver Cowdery. "Yes, I am Oliver Cowdery," the speaker began. "I was close to the Prophet through the time when he, under the di- LESSON DEPARTMENT rection of God and His Son Jesus Christ, and with the help of Angels, brought back the Gospel of our Savior to the earth. "With this nght hand, holding it up, I wrote most of the Book of Mormon as it fell from the lips of the inspired Prophet, Joseph Smith. I was shown the Gold Plates by the Angel Moroni. That book is divinely true. "Some say I apostatized. I never did apostatize. I simply stopped. I am here today to ask humbly to be taken back into the fold. I seek no office in this Church. I want to be with my brethren and to do all I can to help in this great work." Dramatic incidents are what help bring the mighty meaning of the gospel to life. They are materials 61 out of which literature, of the true and lasting kind may be created. Not all such living stories have yet found their way into our history, nor into worthy fiction, poetry, and drama. Years ahead will doubtless see such rich material woven into worthy literature.

Where is the line to be drawn? This is where the ancient concept of constitutional-legal limitations, of "limited government," comes in to guide the democratic process. Although the community is free to impose restrictions, it should also be conscious of its liberty to do so, and recognize the necessity of legal, orderly processes in approaching such problems. Only thus can the best welfare of the majority, as in the case of the pre-marital examination, be served and arbitrary mischief avoided. Even so, the task of government is always to strike the delicate balance between liberty, authority, and public welfare. This demonstrates the importance of political theory in evaluating contemporary policies! For when government is limited and responsible there is a tendency for all other groups to emulate the government. What is happening in the modern world is that men everywhere look to the State for security, for "salvation" from all of their enemies, domestic and foreign. Let us look at this attitude somewhat more closely. What do most of the people you know look toward to solve the housing problem? The liquor problem? (Utah, in its department of Public Welfare, established an alcoholics board in 1947.) Public health? Wool and sugar prices? Strikes? Care of the aged? Unemployment? Can the State alone save a man from the effects of liquor, unemployment, old age, poor health? We should recognize that, although the State can assist in solving these problems, and that it may 63 provide the primary solution for many of them, the fact remains that there are certain fundamental limits to the scope of everything. For example, men, history shows, can and will resist the State. As discussed in earlier pages, we have seen that God recognizes the liberty or free agency of men and will "force no man to heaven." So, a sound political doctrine, even if it deifies the State (as certain modern political doctrines do), should recognize that the State as State or the State even as "god," has limitations! Any scientific observation known to man recognizes that any principle of science operates within limits. But some men, rejecting a rational God who respects men's own personalities, and wanting to substitute therefor "'a sure thing," rush pellmell into the arms of not only the State but other equally misleading panaceas. As one having some experience with a_ well-established State function, public education, I know that the State cannot of itself force education! It can provide the best of schools, classrooms, books, and teachers. Some who attend will use their "liberty" to gain educational advantage. Others will show little more than the effects of exposure to all the resources the State may mobilize, educationally, on the student's behalf—including teachers who will collectively exhaust the tricks of the trade, known and unknown, to "reach" and stir up desire for self-action on the part of the student. Nearly all students can eventually be "reached" and motivated. But all State action does not typify the patience of a public school teacher. 64 The Communist—Socialist Attack Notwithstanding these well-established facts of experience, certain political philosophies assume that materialism and environment wholely determine, rather than influence human behavior. Some therefore seek to establish the totalitarian State as the means of solving all human problems. Paraphrasing the scripture, they seem to say, "Cast thy burdens upon the State and it will sustain thee!" Usually their cause is advanced by the argument that until the State is all-powerful and can control and distribute all materials, mankind cannot really be free! This is like saying that people should never have come to Utah until the ditches were dug, the streets paved, the flowers planted, the lights turned on, and the tables set for ready-cooked feasts, piled high thereon! Some socialists, a few have recognized and are willing to abide by the scientific doctrine of limited government, but the communists accept the doctrine of the necessity of total State dictatorship as the way to man's temporal salvation. In return, it is evident that the men in those systems find they have all too often received slavery under the guise of promises of wellbeing. The Values of Constitutional Government The values of constitutional govermment have already been well marked out in this series. In summary, they may be expressed as follows: 1. Liberty for the maturing individual to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness— including his home and property. 2. Liberty of real association in groups, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1949 including religious as well as diverse political parties and various economic groups which share the responsibilities of governing men and each other. 3. Freedom, with tolerance, to "proselyte," whether it be a corporation selling soap; a union selling memberships; a religion, or various colleges competing for students—with corresponding liberty of each individual to choose for himself or reject them all. This freedom embraces those of speech, press, person, religion, political and social association. And as a result—we have: 4. Freedom to choose and retire officers of government without fear or restraint. 5. Freedom to inquire and discover, in human experience and the media of inspiration, constant means of improving ourselves, our community, and our government. Finally: 6. The rule of law results from all these, imposing restraints and responsibilities on the individual, all groups, and the government, and setting up orderly procedures (jury trial, elections, the right of assembly and petition, judicial determination in open court) whereby rights may be secured. Govemment thus limited by law may become constitutional government. Thus, in a constitutional system, "governments have a right to enact such laws as... Are best calculated to secure the public interest" (D. & C. 134:5). Best calculated by whom? The people! And _ thus, constitutional or limited government, while never static nor confined to single objects, is always defined. And whatever is defined is under limitation and cannot be arbitrary without public notice. Thus human liberty is served. All this is guatanteed and made possible under constitutional government. The Defense of Constitutional Government The doctrine of human liberty and the necessity for organized human society combine and are reconciled in the concept of constitution- LESSON DEPARTMENT 65 "Onstitution j, Ithoug €Nvironmen lS Of signal Static or Igid, nor IS its €anin IMportg © no doctr; of "grou und in cant Or form defense will" has { proved as UCcessful as of Onstitutiona] Eovernment there- 4 gtoup wil] based on Individual] Ore lies ( 1) in the theoretica] front, fre dom.

Cannon Wilford Woodruff ILFORD Woodruff, the fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, descended from sturdy New England ancestors whose love of independence in religion had brought them to America in the seventeenth century. Although he was deeply religious he never formally affiliated himself with any of the existing churches as he found them to be lacking in the teachings and organization of the Church as described in the New Testament. Born in Farmington, Connecticut, March 1, 1807, he learned the trade of a flour miller at his father's mill and later Wilford Woodruff Joseph F. Smith became an independent operator. In 1832 he moved to New York State. The following year two missionaries preaching the restored gospel held a meeting in the schoolhouse in his vicinity and he attended. The spirit of revelation rested upon him and at the conclusion of the service he bore testimony to the assembly that the missionaries had brought them a true message. 'Two days later, December 31, 1833, he was baptized. He moved to Kirtland the following year and during the ensuing sixtyfive years labored as one of the stalwart builders of the kingdom of God on earth.

President Woodruff was sustained as President and he selected the same two counselors who had so ably served President Taylor. The administration of President Woodruff was 4 remartkable one. He was eighty-two years of age at the time he became President. 'The Church was engaged in a struggle for its very existence. The government had confiscated the Church properties and had disincorporated the Church, and its leaders had chosen to £0 into hiding in preference to receiving severe puson sentences for adhering to the principle of plural marriage. It was at this critical time that President Woodruff issued the Manifesto based on a revelation which he had received, in September 1890, which made official declaration of the fact that the Church had discontinued the practice of -plural marriage. At the following general conference of the Church held in October the Manifesto was accepted by the Latter-day Saints by unanimous yote. Thus it became binding upon the members of the Church. Another work that characterized the administration of President Woodruff was the support he gave to Church education. The Church entered the educational field to pro vide its members with education beyond elementary years and _ established many academies, which later became high schools, throughout the length and breadth of ments made by the saints.
