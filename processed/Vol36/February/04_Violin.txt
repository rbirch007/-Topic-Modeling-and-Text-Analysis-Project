violins, two hundred years old, are worth their weight in gold. Says Stradivarius, in Mary Ann Evans' immortal poem of that name: "If my hands slacken, I should rob God—since He is fullest good—leaving a blank instead of violins. He could not make Antonius Stradivarius violins without Antonius." Now, I like that thinking. Even though the Lord provides all the facilities, he has to have someone through whom he can work. I do 78 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1949 not know whether or not you know how much a violin like this is worth, but about a year and a half ago, we had one here in Salt Lake. It was brought out of Poland during the war by a refugee, and when he crossed the border line to get past the Germans he had to play some ragtime or swing, or whatéver you call it, so that he would mislead the guards and not attach any particular importance to the violin, but when the Germans found that it had been permitted to get out of Poland, they put to death the man who had had the custody and ownership of the violin. I said to the man who played it: "That must be a very valuable instrument. What is it really worth?" "Oh, I do not know," he said. "I am carrying fifty thousand dollars insurance on it." Now, even the Lord could not make Antonius Stradivarius violins without Antonius, and you will have this monument standing to your credit, as the Savior said, that will be a memorial just as long as this Church shall stand. Now, I think that it is proper that we should build well. Some of you think that it might be a little extravagant. Sister Evans read some of the statements of Ruskin on building. I would like to pick it up from there, and read another statement he made about building. When we build, let us think that we build forever. Let it not be for present delight, nor for present peace alone, let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for, and let us think as we lay stone on stone, that a time is to come when those stones will be held sacred because our hands have touched them, and that men will say, as they look upon the labor and wrought substance of them, see, this our fathers (our mothers) did for us. And you remember the story they tell about. When President Brigham Young made the contract for laying the foundation of this temple, which is sixteen feet wide. He came here one day and found the contractor throwing in chipped granite instead of those huge blocks, and he made him tear them all out and put in the blocks, with the statement: "We are building this temple to stand through the millennium." E were riding down First Avenue some few years ago with the First Presidency, and President Grant said: "Bishop, stop your car here a minute," and I did, and he said: "I never look at that temple from this point but what I think of the pioneers who undertook to build a building of that magnitude when they were a thousand miles away from transportation and had nothing but their hands to build with. What faith and courage." They were not building for today. They were building, as President Brigham Young said, that it might stand through the millennium. And that is the type of building that the Relief Society has planned to build, one that will stand as long as this earth continues in its present form and for its present purposes until we will have a new heaven and a new earth, and with all my heart I congratulate them and you in this great achievement. I have told this story about an English lord who came here some few years ago. He was shown through the Church Office Building by one of our good brethren, and you know the upper strata in | A MEMORIAL TO THE RELIEF SOCIETY SISTERS: 79 England have not heard such good reports of the Mormons. They have always been more or less critical. And when he looked around and saw those marble pillars and marble walls he said: "Well, well, this is a going concern." Now, sisters, the Relief Society is a going concern. You have come through all the days of pioneering, all the dreams that the Prophet Joseph could have had for you when this organization was established, it seems to me, have been realized, and it is one of the great institutions, not only of the Church, but of the entire world. And I have said upon many occasions if we did not have anything in this Church but the Relief Society organization, we would have a great Church, and it would be much greater than some other churches in this world today. In closing, I would like to leave the thought with you that not only should we build our buildings of granite and materials that will stand and weather every storm, stand as long as this earth shall endure in its present state, but we ought to continue to build into the hearts of those who labor in our organizations the kind of faith that the pioneers had, the faith that our early leaders had, where no sacrifice was too great, and I pray that the Lord will give you that inspiration, that it will continue to be with you. We have had the great privilege and honor for over ten years to sit as advisers with your presidency. We know their ambitions and their objectives. We know many of the things they are achieving, that you do not see out in your own wards and stakes, in their social work here, in the placement of little children into good Latter-day Saint homes, and we know that their service is so broad and extensive, surely God is pleased with the great organization founded under the divine inspiration and leadership of the Prophet of this dispensation, and may God grant that that same spirit and power and inspiration may penetrate into the remotest corners of the earth, whereever this organization touches, and may' God bless these good sisters who preside over you, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. ~_-
