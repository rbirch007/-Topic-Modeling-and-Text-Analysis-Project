Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon housework in a communistic society? Jew se women are doing a splendid work of regeneration among their young girls in foreign countries, by establishing homes where various types of training are afforded and subsequent employment is found for them. The homes provide a democratic atmosphere and an interesting social life. The entrants are selected by committees of women doctors, psychiatrists, business women, and social workers. Many of the girls were in wartime concentration camps. BLIZABETH CANNON PORTER McCRIMMON, formerly of Salt Lake City, now of Los Angeles, was honored guest at a luncheon of the Circulo Hispano-Americano in San Francisco, during Pan-American Week. Mrs. McCrnmmon is the author of Cortez the Conqueror, and after the luncheon, her book was reviewed by a well-known critic, and highly praised by the president of the club.

Page 453 C— EDITORIAL 9 VOL. 36 JULY 1949 She lew Frontier ORE than a hundred years have passed since the vanguard of the Latter-day Saints first entered the wide and lonely valley between the Wasatch Mountains and the Salt Sea. They were pioneers to a land of promise and theirs was the task of subduing the arid Jand and of building edifices of faith and courage and erecting and sustaining the more lofty temples of the spirit. Our forefathers on that long journey to Zion were accustomed to sorrow and disappointment. Their campfire thoughts and their hopes and dreams along the trail were a weaving of grief for those whom they had left behind and a surge of hopeful beckoning into the unknown land. Their old homes had disappeared forever on the eastern horizon and they looked toward the West as pilgrims seeking "the ramparts of the rocks" for their protection. President Brigham Young, expressed his thoughts of the valleys in prophetic words: God will temper the climate, and we shall build a city and a temple to the Most High God in this place. We will extend our settlements to the east and west, to the north and to the south, and we will build towns and cities by the hundreds, and thousands of the saints will gather in from the nations of the earth. This will become the great highway of the nations. Much of the conquest of the land has been completed, in the home Page 454 valleys and even in the far-off places. There are few unknown regions to beckon the pioneers of today. Our generation faces a new fromier that requires an even more elusive accomplishment. To us and to our children have been given the task and the duty of retaining in its strength and purity the gospel heritage which our forefathers cherished through tribulation. And it is our further responsibility to use our time and our energy, the allotted span of our lives, to help in the great work of directing the minds of men and women towards the rich spiritual life which is gained through brotherhood, through being keepers of not only our own eternal destiny, but through being also of service in the spreading of the message of Jesus, which must be exemplified at home and carried to the far frontiers. It is, perhaps, an easy and an accurate accomplishment to measure — that yield of grain which has been secured from the desert, but who is there among us capable of measuring the harvest that may come from a spiritual planting? These seeds develop less certainly and may require a greater length of time for their maturing. And we who seek a new frontier must go forward with great courage and with the inspired devotion of the true pioneer who sees not only the near goal, but the long road that reaches beyond this world. V. P. C. AUGUSTA WINTERS GRANT (Photograph taken on a recent birthday) Birthday Greetings to Sister Augusta Winters Grant Age Ninety-Three, July 7th gracious and lovely woman, rich in memories, and still interested in the affairs of her family, her community, and her Church, Sister Augusta Winters Grant, widow of President Heber J. Grant, finds much pleasure and contentment in the sunset time of her life. Comfortable and happy in her pleasant home high above City Creek Canyon and Memory Grove, Salt Lake City, Sister Grant often sits at her window looking out upon the valley and the gleaming lake, thinking, perhaps, of the part she and her family have played in the development and growth of the city and Church. Sister Augusta, as she is lovingly called, is a precious link to the past, for she was so much a part of her husband's life that she still seems to be inseparably joined to him in the affections of Church people. She has many friends and a large family who make her days bright with remembrances, telephone calls, and visits. Relief Society women throughout the Church wish her a happy birthday and many days of contentment among the people she loves.

In the coming months Sister Judd will present other suggestions suitable to particular seasons.—Ed.] Sable Settings for the Canyon E love to go into our canW yons—not only because they are so beautiful, but because of the complete change from our ordinary surroundings which the scenery gives. Just as your guests enjoy wearing casual clothes for your canyon party, so they will welcome original ideas in your table settings to enhance the satisfying food which robust canyon appetites call for. So this month I want to talk about table settings suitable for out-of-door picnics, or to be used in canyon and country homes. It is in our family log cabin at Brighton in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah, that most of my activities have centered, so I am asking you to pardon me if I become a bit personal. | One affair that I shall never forget, because of the complications preceding the dinner, took place at the M. I. A. Home at Brighton. I had planned a pioneer theme since the date was near July Twenty-fourth. When I arrived to set the long table in the dining room, I found, to my consternation, that a meeting of the general boards of the Y. W. And Y. M. M. IA. Was in_ progress there and would continue for some time. What to do? It was suggested Page 456 that there were some window shutters stacked away for the winter. Could we improvise a table by placing these shutters on wooden sawhorses? We did! I tried to use wrapping paper in place of a cloth, but the shutters were so wide that, even by using two strips of paper the length of the table, there was a gap of about seven inches in the center. Fortunately, I had planned to decorate with covered wagons, miniature bonfires, and pioneer dolls. I quickly ran outside, shoveled up some loamy soil, generously sprinkled with dry pine needles, and made a realistic road down the center of the table. The covered wagons and the bonfires looked quite at home. These latter were made by placing dry twigs in the form of a tepee with bits of orange and yellow cellophane tucked under the twigs to simulate fire. A stick of burning incense placed in the top of the twigs made a spiral of smoke. Place cards were bits of sagebrush tied with calico bows. An idea which I have used over and over, varying the central theme according to my mood, is to make an out-of-door scene for the center of the dinner table in the cabin at Brighton. The base is nothing more nor less than a large square of gal- TABLE SETTINGS AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS vanized iron salvaged from an ancient washing machine. (The machine, long since useless for its original purpose, makes an excellent coal bin.) It has been such fun when on a tmp, to pick up some quaint little object for our canyon table setting. From Yellowstone Park came several little incense burners in the form of log cabins and a tiny bear to stand under a miniature pine tree. Ever so small Indian baskets and Pieces of pottery were found in Mex. Ico. There are even some little rubber donkeys, with natives astride, from faraway Haiti. Some of my most prized possessions have come from the "five and ten." Here | found metal sets of cowboys and Indians and some very realistic bits of rustic fence to arrange as I choose. From Bethel, Maine, the home of my maternal pioneer ancestors, came some little birch canoes to float on our make-believe lake. HE lake is made of a Piece of broken mirror with plaster of Paris, painted tan, encircling it. The entire piece of metal that we use on the table is covered with green moss which we gather a short time before the guests arrive so that it will keep 457 fresh and moist. There are always a few tiny wild flowers available, such as buttercups and forget-me-nots, with which to dot the moss. A few colorful rocks, bits of bark, and treelike twigs complete the setting for whatever figures we decide to use. Wild flowers always make a lovely canyon centerpiece. I especially love a patriotic combination of red Indian paintbrush, white columbines, and bluebells, and they come as if ordered just right for the month of July. But sometimes it happens to be just between seasons. This will give your Imagination a chance for free play. The oddest idea I ever used was one summer when it rained overly much, with the result that flowers were scarce. There were, however, quantities of toadstools and mushrooms, with their umbrella-shaped caps delicately tinted in mauves, creams, and rose colors. These, with moss and rocks, made an unusual and really beautiful table. I remember particularly the huge fungus which measured a good ten inches across and held lighted tapers. Next month I shal] talk about "glamour weeds." + Sinomorhs Christie Lund Coles Swiftly I lift my eyes To catch their loveliness, Like sprays of sequins On the night's blue dress, Like golden trumpets, Music, visible; Like shattered rainbows, Jeweled, beautiful, I watch them and my heart Lifts upward now to ache, Hearing the sputtering sound As new ones rise and break, And fall upon the night In such brief finery That ancient stars are dimmed Before their sorcery, Joanna Margery S.
