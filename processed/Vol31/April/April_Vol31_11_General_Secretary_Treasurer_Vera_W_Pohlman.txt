General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes from the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104. MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS New England Mission OLLOWING are excerpts from a recent letter from Bertha S. Reeder, mission Relief Society president, and Elder Kenneth W. Porter, mission Relief Society supervisor: "During 1943 seven new Societies were organized, as follows: Augusta, Maine; Concord, New Hampshire; Hyde Park, Massachusetts; Litchfield, Maine; Newport, Rhode Island; Danforth, Maine; and Eaton, Maine. "The two latter groups, being in northern Maine where deep snows make the holding of meetings extremely difficult, are not now functioning. The meetings which were held, however, did much to fill the needs of those who participated and were, thus, profitable. The new Societies in some of these places are the only Church meetings being held and are valuable in maintaining faith and unity. "Fine anniversary meetings, bazaars, and branch conferences were held in most places of the mission during the year. The sisters of the branches where we have recently purchased chapels are working diligently to improve and beautify these buildings, and have done much to Page 232 stimulate increased interest on the part of other members. "Due to quite a strict curtailment of gasoline we have not been able to visit each branch as frequently as desired.... With the great reduction in our missionary force, it will be necessary for our Relief Societies to carry on with even less supervision than before, but most of them are now fairly well grounded in practices and should operate regardless. These Societies are the backbone of Church activity in several localities. "During the month of September most of the officers of the mission Relief Societies (about fifty-five in number) met at Cambridge in conference, where work and methods for the present season were discussed. Those attending carried back to their respective branches inspiration and enthusiasm which is gratifying. The accompanying picture was taken on that occasion. "The mission has received upwards of twenty-five quilts and many boxes of clothing from the several Societies. We provided complete Christmas for five or six families in northern Maine, and throughout the year have helped several dozen persons.  ? "Our objectives have been and NOTES FROM THE FIELD 233 shall continue to be the organization of more neighborhood groups, getting the women more adept at handiwork, an increased amount of welfare materials, and the keeping of more complete and accurate records. OFFICERS OF RELIEF SOCIETIES IN THE NEW ENGLAND MISSION  at a conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts in September 1943, where work of the 1943-44 season was considered "It has been gratifying to work with the women of the mission during the past year. Several baptisms have resulted from Relief Society work. We have learned much; our happiness has been deep. The future looks bright and our faith is strong."
The General Board notes with particular interest the organization of a Relief Society at Concord, New Hampshire, during 1943 as reported in the first paragraph of the foregoing letter. New Hampshire has been the only state without a Relief Society, according to the geographic distribution of Relief Societies, in recent annual reports. With the organization of a Relief Society at Concord, the 1943 annual report will doubtless show organized Relief Societies in every state of the Union, as well as in the District of Columbia, the territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and in many other countries. A commendable accomplishment of the New England Mission during 1943 was the completion of an historical summary of all Relief Societies in the mission for the eighteen-month period, January 1942 through June 1943. This compiled history was mimeographed and distributed to all Societies in the mission, so that each might review the activities and accomplishments of the others. Mission Relief Society president, Bertha S. Reeder, and mission Relief Society supervisor, Elder Kenneth W. Porter, who edited these historical summaries from the branches, point out that 234 more work was actually done than would appear from this record due to the brevity of the reports, and that it is hoped that this first history will be followed by a regular series of such reports. They also recognize that varying conditions in the different localities naturally influence the accomplishments of the local Relief Societies, some of which are small and operate as neighborhood groups, and others of which are larger and more experienced in Relief Society work. They conclude: "Yet every group has done much to spread happiness and to comfort and care for the needy; each has helped to improve conditions of many homes, has brought a unity and love into places which previously had not known such peace;" and that the accomplishments of each Relief Society demonstrate the effectiveness of the realization that the Relief Society was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith. They also feel that the effort of compiling and distributing copies of these histories would be justified if each local Society, in reviewing the work of other Societies in the mission, were "to get one new idea, one improved method or inspiration to carry on in the face of difficulties." Spanish-American Mission IVIE H. Jones, president of Relief Societies in the Spanish-American Mission, submitted the following account of accomplishments of two of the several local Spanish speaking Relief Societies in this mission: " When in my name but two or three shall meet, I there will surely be? "The above words of our Lord and Master seem especially appropriate for the Spanish-American Relief Society of Kingsville, 'Texas. "At the beginning of 1943, this Relief Society had one L. D. S. Member, Sister Esther Rodriguez. Nothing daunted, she went out and proselyted members for her meetings. She invited her neighbors, Sisters Cabasos, Maria Gonzales, and Luz Rodriguez to join her. Through their combined efforts, they completed the beautiful quilt seen in the accompanying picture. They sold the quilt, netting $11. "So at the beginning of 1944 the Relief Society spirit is burning brightly in Kingsville. 'Through the efforts of Sister Rodriguez and her helper, Elder Lloyd McArthur, one new member has been added to the Relief Society, and they have prospects of baptisms and additions of many new members in 1944." When submitting the picture, Elder McArthur wrote: "Inasmuch as we have but one L. D. S. Member in the Relief Society, we have had a struggle with Relief Society attendance. All we have accomplished, however much or little it has been, is due to the courage, faith and effort of Hna. Rodriguez (Esther)." Reina Pulver, secretary of the Spanish-speaking Phoenix Relief Society of the Spanish-American Mission, wrote last November to the mission Relief society president, Ivie H. Jones, as follows: "We Relief Society sisters in Phoenix have our aim high. We want a chapel, and we are determined to get it. We want one that we will be proud to call our own: one where we can worship God in peace and contentment; a place where we will be proud to NOTES FROM THE FIELD 235 QUILT MADE BY THE RELIEF SOCIETY OF KINGSVILLE, TEXAS All members of this Society are included in the picture, and are, from left to right, Sisters Cabasos, Maria Gonzales, Esther Rodriguez, and Luz Rodriguez. Bring our friends. We want it in the best neighborhood available and in beautiful surroundings. Beauty is the handiwork of the Lord. "We are proud to be members of the Kingdom of God and want to live lives that will bring us strong testimonies and be examples to our neighbors." Sister Jones continues: "And these eight sisters meant just what they said. They were organized into a Relief Society, January 16, 1943, with eight members. At that time four executive officers were chosen, but none of them was set apart until April 22, 1943 when the new mission presidents made their first official visit to Phoenix. The weather was already beginning to remind one that Phoenix is in the 'Sunny South,' so the sisters planned a picnic and Relief Society conference out in the hills. After the picnic supper and program, which was attended by forty-seven people, the sisters were set apart. "Tt was a sight never to be forgotten. The sisters were seated one by one on a huge rock, while men holding the Priesthood called upon God to bless these sisters in their high callings. Out in the quiet Arizona desert where there was nothing to disturb nor detract, the moon and stars in the heavens bore witness of this sacred ceremony. "Even before their organization, these eight women planned a Cena or Mexican supper, to raise money so that they could start out with a cash balance, and they began their: existence as an organization with $100 on hand. "On February 4, 1943 they gave another Mexican Cena in the Third Ward chapel, clearing $154. Then November 12, 1943 they staged another of their famous Mexican banquets. This time they set their aim high and secured the Phoenix Stake building, serving 530 persons, banquet style. Immediately after the meal a program of Mexican songs, dances, and readings was presented for the entertainment of the guests. It did not take long to sell every article made for their bazaar and they could have easily sold many times the amount, not only because of the crowd present, but because the articles made were different and most of them had Mexican designs on them. They cleared on the bazaar $363.21 and on the Cena or banquet, $310.10, making a total net profit for the evening's affair of $428.51. They have retained a small working fund in their local Society and have a building fund in the mission office of $663.63 towards their new chapel.
"Yes," they say with confident but the faith and perseverance of this little band of Mexican sisters will enable them to realize their ambitions, and some day they will be meeting in their own building."
British Mission
THE Millennial Star, publication of the British Mission, reported, in its issue for December 1943, the first mission-wide Relief Society conference of the British Mission which was held November 13 and 14 at mission headquarters in London. Following are excerpts from the Star's report of this historic gathering of Relief Society women:
"Never before in the history of the British Mission has such a gathering been held. Invitations sent to District Supervisors, Branch Presidents and Counsellors received outstanding response. From all parts of the British Isles sisters wrote stating their keen desire to attend. Even from places as far distant as Ireland, Sister Mary Mogerley of Dublin and Lilian Ditty of Belfast tried to obtain a permit enabling them to travel. Unfortunately their efforts proved of no avail. Telegrams were received expressing their disappointment at being unable to attend and best wishes for the success of the conference.
"An executive meeting conducted by Sister Maud A. Hawkes, second councillor, Mission R. S. Presidency, commenced a series of interesting and inspiring sessions. Various problems were discussed and ideas presented for the growth of the work. Immediately following, a delightful meal, prepared by President Marie W. Anastason, was served to 75 persons present.
"In the evening, further opportunity to get to know each other was given to the sisters during a Social Gathering conducted by Sister M. McCormick, where items were given in representative of various Branches and Districts.
"'Saturday Day meetings began at 10 a.m. with Testimony', conducted by Sister Helen E. Poole, first councillor, R. S. Presidency. Eighty-five sisters bore testimony to the truthfulness of the Gospel and the joy of service in Relief Society work. A telegram received from the Mission Presidency was read to the congregation by Sister Anastason.
"The general session was outstanding for the wide range of excellent addresses given by the following speakers: Sisters M. McCormick (Historian), M. A. Hawkes (Practical Work), H. E. Poole (Education) and J. N. Gittins (Statistics). A tribute to Relief Society work was paid by President Wm. O. Chipping of the London District . . . Elder James R. Cunningham of the Mission Presidency, spoke of the unity that existed between the Priesthood and members of the Relief Society, and compared it to the beautiful influence of noble women on great men of the world . . . Sister Anastason, as the final speaker, addressed the congregation on 'The Joy of Service.'
"It is generally felt that the uplifting spirit of what is expected to be the first of many such gatherings will have a beneficial influence upon all branches of Relief Society endeavour.
"Regret was expressed at the absence of President Andre K. Anastason, whose Mission obligations took him to the Hull District."
Norwegian Mission
SINCE involvement of the United States in war little information has been received from Relief Societies on the European continent. The following news from the Relief Society at Oslo is, therefore, of special interest. It is copied from a History of the Mission for the two-month period ending September 15, 1943, which was received by Elder Thomas E. McRay, assistant to the Council of the Twelve, who is serving as European Mission president:
"Oslo Branch Woman's Relief Society gave a grand dinner to twenty-aged members of the branch, who accepted the invitation and enjoyed the sumptuous delicacies, which had been furnished by the Danish Mission, and which was to all a great surprise. As all can realize, the feelings were excellent, and
there was no lack of entertainment either. Sister Pauline Kjos, in defiance of her 75 years, played on the mouth organ and showed herself to be a real virtuoso. There were grand compositions and Church melodies. Sister Thora Enholm sang, and the whole company sang several of our choice songs. Sister Juliane Berggruff read a few splendid pieces of her own composition.
"The Pioneer festival was passed up this year, but this dinner was an excellent compensation, and all the aged were appreciative of the eventful happening and enjoyment, and thanks to the Danes for the food which made the whole affair possible."
Australian Mission
ELSIE F. PARTON, released in July, 1943, as president of the Hurstville Branch Relief Society, after serving in this capacity more than six years, submitted the accompanying picture of the group of women serving at the Civilian Aid Service Rest Center, most of whom are members of the Hurstville Relief Society. She enclosed clippings from local newspapers which recognized demonstrations conducted by this center. These demonstrations portrayed the registration, care, treatment, location, and placing of a family made destitute through enemy action. Following is an excerpt from one of these clippings:
"On Thursday afternoon, 18th instant, the Latter-day Saints' Women's National Relief Society gave a demonstration to other Rest Center organizers of the Kogarah Municipality the centre is situated on the corner of Noble Street and Railway Parade, Allawah. Having passed all tests it has been registered as No. 7, and is considered to be. A model in efficiency and equipment.... CIVILIAN AID REST CENTER OPERATED BY RELIEF SOCIETY WOMEN, HURSTVILLE, N. S. W., AUSTRALIA Fourth from left, front row, is Elsie F. Parton, recently released president of this branch. Directly behind her is Sister F. Evans, the new president, and next to her, at the end of the second row, is Ethel Wilson, new secretary. The retiring secretary, Ruby B. Phillips, who served more than ten years is in the back row, second from the right. At the left end of the back row is Violet Cook, Missionrepresentative. Twenty trained ladies, under the supervision of Mrs. J. Parton, control the post. A display was given covering several branches of the work.... The efficiency of the centre was established when over one hundred people were provided with refreshments, when only forty had been expected to attend." This demonstration was held in June 1942, and President and Sister Elvon W. Orme, in charge of the Australian Mission, were among the visitors, as were also officials in charge of this civilian war service. This rest center is established in the recreation hall of the L. D. S. Chapel and many of the demonstration visitors show an interest in the Church and its activities. Sister Parton says, "We have lovely green lawns, a high position looking down upon the blue waters of historical Botany Bay, where Captain Cook first landed on this soil.... We have many non-members on our staff, as well as the Relief Society members, and they are all good, noble women whom I have grown to love. We have worked hard collecting the needed supplies?food, ? utensils, heating apparatus, kerosene lamps, candles, and clothing for all ages. Patchwork covers were knitted and stitched, old clothing repaired, and NOTES FROM THE FIELD my husband made folding beds." Some of Sister Parton's comments as she looked back over her six years of service as branch Relief Society president give an indication of both the trials and growth to be obtained from Relief Society service. She wrote: "I occupied the position for over six years. During that period I learned many things, spiritual and temporal. I learned each person is a separate individuality and needs to be treated as such, that it is impossible to please all, that it is selfish and unwise to please self only, and to strive to please God is the only guide in meeting the problems concerning leadership. I have seen members come and go, I have met with loyal cooperation and with disgruntled, dissatisfied people, with rich and with poor, with generous and mean, with leaders of our nation and with the dregs of humanity, and in all of these people I have found something good, something worthwhile, and that something is the unquenchable flame of divinity coming from our Father God to which all are heirs. I have received a broader outlook on life and have learned what God meant when he said, 'Let not the left hand know what the right hand doeth' and the necessity of becoming 'as wise as a serpent and as gentle as a dove.' " Sister Parton's two counselors, Sisters F. Evans and G. Beal, were retained in the new organization as president and first counselor, respectively, and Ethel Parton and Ethel Wilson were named as second counselor and secretary, respectively. The retiring secretary, Ruby B. Phillips, was the first secretary of this branch Relief Society 239 and served in this capacity for more than ten years. Like many other Relief Society women in various parts of the world, Sister Parton is mourning the loss of a son who was a pilot officer in the Royal Australian Air Force. And like many other Relief Society women, her sorrow is not tinctured with hatred nor revenge, for she says, "May God help the mothers of all men everywhere, for we sorrow alike, friend or foe." New Zealand Mission ELVA T. COWLEY, president of Relief Societies in the New Zealand mission, in a letter dated August 18, 1943, reported the patriotic Hui Tau or conference which was held at Easter. She enclosed a copy of the June 1943 issue of the mission paper Te Karere containing reports on this mission-wide conference by both President Matthew Cowley and Sister Elva T. Cowley. An excerpt from President Cowley's report follows: "It was decided some months ago that the Annual Conference this year would be in the nature of a campaign to raise funds for the war effort. At the outset there was some question as to the advisability of holding such a conference, but the success of the Hui has convinced all that it was one of the best missionary activities ever sponsored in New Zealand. How well the conference was conducted and the patriotic fund campaign was carried out is now well known, not only by those who were in attendance at the conference, but by people in all parts of the Dominion who have read the reports in the leading newspapers.". 240 From Sister Cowley's report we quote: "For weeks the sisters of the Relief Society, as well as others, gave of their time and energy to raise money for their sons, husbands, fathers and brothers who are fighting so nobly for them. They sponsored concerts, programmes, held bazaars and dinners, etc. The Societies who were unable to contribute in these activities were generous with their money donations. Even though their energy and endurances were taxed to the utmost before the Hui, the women did not lose sight of their great obligation to make of it a spiritual success. "On Easter morning, with a glorious blue sky overhead and the sun shining with a warm glow on all living things, they assembled in the big house to gain instruction and commemorate the resurrection of our Lord and Savior. "Talks on education, spirituality, child welfare, Red Cross and home nursing, loyalty, cleanliness and thrift were given in both the Maori and English languages by women with a deep understanding of the Gospel and a wide knowledge of life." In the afternoon the women again met to resume their work. This meeting took the form of discussion of general problems and questions. Following are additional comments from Sister Cowley's letter: "The policemen, whose duty it was to guard the grounds, commented that they had never had such an easy task. They found no empty liquor bottles which they said was most unusual with such a large gathering. The city officials also commended the Hui Tau committee on the way they left the show grounds. They commented that they were left cleaner than when they were turned over to us for the conference." East Central States Mission LEONE W. DOXEY, recently appointed president of Relief Societies in the East Central States Mission, wrote February 16, 1944, as follows: In Charlottesville, Virginia, where 'Monticello, the famous home of Thomas Jefferson is located, an enthusiastic Relief Society was recently organized. Sister Amelia J. Hansen, one of our short-term missionaries from the Pasadena Stake, California, was very helpful in this organization. "Sister Maggie S. Snow was appointed president. She has long been known in Charlottesville for her fine welfare work. She is often called, 'Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch' for her efforts to improve the condition of the poor families, helping them to help themselves. Some wealthy people, observing her work, have made contributions to her from time to time, to aid in her projects. "They are also doing a fine missionary work. Four members of their Relief Society, who did not belong to the Church, were baptized and confirmed recently. They have fifteen paid memberships, and are following a regular program of Relief Society activity. "We are very proud of this organization and the fine women who are carrying on the work of Relief Society in Charlottesville." LOOK AHEAD! Make your business training broad enough for peace as well as war. Prepare now for the needs? and opportunities?of tomorrow.
