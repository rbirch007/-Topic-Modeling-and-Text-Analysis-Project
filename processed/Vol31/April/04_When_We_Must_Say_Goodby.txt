WHEN WE MUST SAY GOODBYE Grace Zenor Pratt... Remember this... When we must say goodbye? There is no need for words.... But turn your loving face toward mine, While in your eyes I read the promise sweet Of faith and courage through the darkest hour; That where you go, I too shall go with you In spirit; on sea, in plane, on battle's gory field, In foulest prison cell, or glorious victory I shall be near to share and bear with you All gain, all loss... For nothing, ever now, Not even pain nor death, can kill our love?Remember this, we have no need for words? When we must say goodbye.
