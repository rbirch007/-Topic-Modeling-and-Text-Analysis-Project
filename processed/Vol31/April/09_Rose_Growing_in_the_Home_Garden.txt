Rose Growing in the Home Garden Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, Deseret News.. When thy roses came to me, My sense with their deliciousness was spell'd; Soft voices had they, that with tender plea Whispered of peace and truth and friendliness unquell'd. ?John Keats HE rose has, for centuries, been the best-loved flower of all mankind. Its beauty compels our warmest admiration and reflects our highest inward thoughts and emotions; all down the ages it has been the symbol of love and affection?small wonder that today it is the most popular and favorite flower of the home gardener. That roses grown in our western states can and do vie with those produced in more favored climates and in famous rose centers, is rapidly becoming an undisputed fact, one which every home gardener should consider. We have been told by rose experts of national reputation that our home-grown garden roses equal, and even excel, the best productions of other localities in their size, splendor, high quality, and profusion. Certainly, this should encourage every flower lover to plant a few rose plants in the home grounds. Every garden can produce good roses. No matter what type or kind of soil it has, so long as the ground is well drained and away from overhanging tall trees, it is capable of producing lovely prize-winning rose blooms. Scientific investigation has established without question that whether the soil is of a sandy nature or a heavy clay soil matters very little if a little preparation is given to the soil when planting, and if fertilizer is added each year to provide the rose plants with the food which they demand and so richly deserve. Considering that once planted, a rose bush can, and often does, go on producing lovely roses year after year for twenty-five years (the author's own garden contains many rose plants that have done so), this small job of properly digging and preparing the soil is little enough to do for such returns. We may not all possess the perfect conditions for growing roses, but it has been found that this flower, more than any other, will adapt and accommodate itself to almost any condition except dense shade and ground that is constantly wet and soggy. Roses dislike having wet feet, yet they must be provided with good moisture during the midsummer months. LANT roses in beds by themselves away from other flowers for best results, and by all means choose a spot which receives sun for a good part of the day. You will be able to grow roses in a more shady location, but the shady beds will not bloom so prolifically as those receiving good sunlight. Should only a partially shady location be available, however, we urge that you still plant Page 223 224 roses, but for such places choose the varieties of light coloring?the exquisite white varieties, the pale blush-pinks and pale yellows. 'These do quite well in rather shady situations, and you may also be able to have roses there during the hot midsummer months when the sunny rose beds are resting. The lovely Graus Aachen varieties, both the pink and the white, are an excellent choice for such partially shady plantings. Plan your rose beds so that they are easily reached from both sides. We must be able to cultivate and care for them handily, as well as enjoy their exquisite tints and fragrance. And the blooms must be easily reached for cutting. Beds from eighteen inches to three feet in width are ideal; wider beds are cumbersome and awkward, and much of the pleasure of close contact with the blooms is sacrificed. We must see our roses at close quarters in order to drink in all their lovely charms. Although roses differ in their height and spread, most varieties of the popular hybrid tea roses that are now planted so profusely, need from eighteen inches to two feet of space per plant. If the rose beds are located out in full sun, well away from trees, then it is wise to set them slightly closer in order to have their foliage help shade the ground from being dried out constantly during summer months. Prepare the beds well in advance of the planting, if possible. This should be one of the earliest of all spring garden jobs. Get the ground ready for planting as soon as your soil is workable, and then let it stand for a few days before planting. By all means secure some barnyard manure to use in your soil preparation, no matter what kind of soil you possess; nothing has ever been found to equal this old stand-by for growing fine roses. Unless this is very old, it should be placed well below the roots of your new plants, for if manure comes in direct contact with any roots, it is apt to cause damage unless it is well decomposed. The best method is to remove the natural soil for a depth of eight inches; then add the fertilizer and dig and work this in well to encourage the roots downward. Deep rooting makes for strong handsome plants that withstand heat and drouth. Garden compost is also splendid for enriching and making the soil mellow, while if your soil is of a sandy nature, then it will pay you to purchase peat moss to add and dig well in before planting. This will help to retain moisture in the poor sandy soil. All or any of these soil improvers should be used generously in the lower level of soil, and well mixed to remove all lumps, to assure your plants of a future feeding ground which will maintain prolific bloom for years to come. Do not put fertilizer in the top layer of soil, but replace the natural soil in which to set the plants. A generous layer of manure and peat moss or even garden compost can be used as a mulch over the top of the beds as soon as planting has been done to coax plants into growth and to keep the soil from drying out. WHEN ready to plant, first fill an old bucket or tub with water in which to set the plants while the planting is being done. This will prevent the roots.
