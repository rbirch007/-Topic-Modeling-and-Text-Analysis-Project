IN NOVEMBER Beatrice Knowlton Ekman All through the long and lonely night, I heard the dead leaves blow Before the wind. Detached and light, Their wings brushed stones below. Now, in the paling gray of dawn, The branches etch the sky; The trees stand bare—the leaves are gone, And raveled clouds trail by. The day will cry night's sorrow down; And ashes embers lie, Mem'ry will wear a brighter gown, And hope again be high— But when at night the dead leaves blow Crisp cadence of November, With rhythmic tempo quick or slow— It's heartbreak I remember.
