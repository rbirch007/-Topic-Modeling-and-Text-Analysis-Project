Ironing Procedures
Claire P. Dorius
Equipment: Much of the drudgery of ironing is eliminated if one has the proper equipment. The ironing board should be well padded, firmly mounted, and a comfortable height. The pad should be covered with a smooth, clean cover.
Arrange equipment conveniently?the dampened clothes at the left on a chair or low table to prevent bending over; and the clothes rack to the right within easy reach. Have a supply of coat hangers at hand. Hangers for blouses, shirts, and dresses will save time and preserve the appearance and shape of the garment.
Sprinkle and smooth out wrinkles. Proper sprinkling, removing of unnecessary wrinkles, and rolling up garments will cut down ironing time considerably and produce better results. To dampen clothes use a bottle with a perforated top or an ordinary whisk broom. Use warm water. It penetrates the fabric more readily. Be sure that all parts are lightly and evenly dampened. If possible, roll up clothes in a rubber sheet for even distribution of moisture. Let stand for at least two hours or overnight if possible. But not longer than twenty-four hours as mildewing may set in.
To conserve on fuel, begin ironing fabrics that need low heat. It is easier to iron collars, cuffs, sleeves, belts, and trimmings before the flat sections of the garment.
Cottons and linens (white and colored) are ironed on the right side, and dark-colored ones, silks and rayons on the wrong side. Table linens are ironed first on the right and then on the wrong side. Change the place for folds in the flat pieces to preserve the life of the material. Each piece should dry thoroughly before putting away. Most irons or ironers have heat control indicators, follow these carefully. If not, the following temperatures have been found to be the most satisfactory: Cottons and linens need relatively high heat; wool and silk moderate heat; rayon, low heat. If the material is acetate rayon very low heat is needed. Combinations of fibers?adjust heat to fiber that requires the lowest temperature.
If you have a mangle, learn to use it efficiently. It will take care of all the flat pieces and many other pieces as skill in its use is developed. Table cloths should be folded selvedge to selvedge, right side out. Iron first on one side and then on the other. Fold again lengthwise and iron on both sides again?fold to put away.
Curtains may need to be dried on curtain stretchers. It is necessary, of course, that the stretchers be adjusted evenly to get satisfactory results. However, many of the curtain panels that are for sale at the present time, do not require any stretching or stretching. These fine rayon fabrics should never be exposed to excessive heat or sunlight because they are apt to deteriorate. Such curtains should never be allowed to become very soiled. They should be washed in a mild soapsuds by squeezing through and through the material. Rinse very thoroughly but carefully. Do not 658 wring or pull or rub. Roll in a turkish towel when wet and knead out the moisture. Fold in the center lengthwise and iron with a warm iron. Never use a hot iron. Some panels look well if hung between two curtain rods until almost dry and then pressed. Men's soft shirts: Begin by ironing the yoke first on the wrong side and then on the right. Next the collar, first the wrong side, then right side until perfectly dry, pulling tightly and working from the points in. Iron neckband completely dry. Shape collar by hand, iron edge of crease. For the front and back, first iron the back, then buttonhole side of front, then button side. Iron both sides of front pleat, holding it firmly to prevent wrinkles. Then iron the sleeves. First the cuffs, ironing the same as the collar. Nose iron up into the gathers. Straighten sleeves from underarm seam; iron on both sides. Iron underarm seam dry. Button the collar before putting the shirt on a hanger. Pressing: The pressing cloth should have a smooth weave free from lint. Light-weight muslin and sateen are very good. If the garment to be pressed is very heavy, more than one thickness of pressing cloth will be needed. When pressing a woolen fabric, place the garment on the ironing board so that the yarns in the weave run straight. Each time you shift the garment be sure the yarns lie straight. Dampen the pressing cloth lightly and evenly; place it on the wrong side of the garment to be pressed. Use a medium hot iron. Press down lightly on the iron; lift it and press down on the next section. Do not move the iron as you do in ironing. Do not press until the cloth is dry. The garment should be moist when you have finished pressing it; then hung on a coat hanger to dry. Miscellaneous Blanket Care?15 things to remember: Wash only one blanket at a time. Make rich heavy suds with mild, alkaline-free soap or flakes. Be sure soap is thoroughly dissolved before adding blanket. Soften the water?keep temperature 100?F. If using washing machine do not let it run more than 3 minutes, by hand not more than 3 to 5 minutes, no longer. Never rub or scrub a blanket. If blanket is still soiled, repeat the process. After washing, squeeze water from blanket, never twist. Loosen the roller in the wringer. To dry?hang blanket lengthwise across two lines. Pull it gently into shape. Blankets dry best on mild breezy days. Never hang in extreme cold or heat. References: "Life Insurance for Your Washables," White King Soap Company.
