Theology and in Visiting Teachers | Training Report Meeting to Be Observed COMPLAINTS have reached the General Board that the meetings on the first Tuesday of the month are often too long, and inquiry has revealed that because of the extensive familiarity with the subject matter and the interest of our members in theology that the class period for this lesson often extends beyond the recommended forty-five minutes. Class leaders are urged to confine the lesson presentation and discussion to forty-five minutes in order to allow time for testimony bearing. We repeat the standing recommendation of the General Board that in large wards the time of the testimony meeting might be extended fifteen minutes to allow for more women to bear testimony. However, this meeting occurs monthly, and Relief Society women also have opportunity to bear testimony in the regular monthly ward fast meeting. It is, therefore, recommended that the theology and testimony meeting be closed at the agreed time. The preceding visiting teachers' training-report meeting must also be well managed so as not to run over time. It is imperative that ward visiting teachers' message leaders confine their presentation of the discussion to the recommended ten to fifteen minutes, and that the regular reports of visiting teachers be confined to the required information. Time limitations for each feature of this meeting are listed in detail in The, page 513. To those women who feel that the allotted time is too short in which to give their message adequately, may we recall that the shortest speeches are often the most effective. Extensive preparation is necessary to be able to give a worthwhile message in a short time. Some of the choicest gems in religious teaching, in literature, and in philosophy are very brief, yet their message is readily grasped.. The Beatitudes can be read in one minute and contain only 143 words, yet their message, remarkable in content, is a blessing that has spanned centuries. I Corinthians, chapter 13, takes less than two minutes to read and contains only 268 words. It is considered by some as coming nearer to the heart of the gospel than anything in the Bible outside the words of Jesus. The Gettysburg Address can be read in two minutes, yet is one of the world's great speeches. The visiting teachers' message as presented in Theis short. The ten to fifteen minutes allotted in the training meeting should be ample for effective discussion and consideration of its application to the teaching situation. 636 (Arranged for women's voices): NOTES TO THE FIELD 637 ORGANIZATIONS Since the last report, printed in the November 1943 issue of TheFormerly Part of Date Stake or Mission Stakes _ Appointed President Ben Lomond Stake Ogden Stake Ora Mac Farlane = November 22, 1943 Grantsville Stake Tooele Stake Carrie Wrathall January 16, 1944 Park Stake Liberty and, Bonneville Stakes Blanche Stoddard = October 24, 1943 REORGANIZATIONS Since the last report, printed in the November 1943 issue of TheStake or Mission Released Appointed President Date Stakes Blackfoot Mary S.
