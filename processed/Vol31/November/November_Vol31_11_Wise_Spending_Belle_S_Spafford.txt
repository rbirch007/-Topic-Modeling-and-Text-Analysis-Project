Wise Spending THE wise use of money is a problem that is ever with us. It is one that becomes very acute during wartime. The present war period has been no exception. The war has been responsible for marked increases in the income of many people. Not only are many people receiving larger pay checks, but family incomes have been increased because more members of the family have become wage earners. The war has also affected, to a certain extent, the pattern of our spending. The cost of certain types of goods, such as food, has been increased, wartime taxes, which must be met, have been levied, etc. This has made it necessary for people to plan, at least to a limited extent, their current expenditures. However, in all too many instances a "'money madness" has taken hold of people?there has been a greed to earn, and money has been spent with reckless abandon. Lavish spending at any time is neither good taste nor good judgment. In wartime it is particularly unbecoming. During wartime a large portion of the nation's productive resources are devoted to the manufacture ' of war materials. Most goods available for civilian consumption are inferior in quality and high in price. It is difficult to obtain full value for money expended with the dollar worth approximately seventy - four cents. Then, too, there are many unavailable goods which will be available in the future, which people will want, and for which they must spend money. The future will also offer many opportunities that are now curtailed, such as travel and educational opportunities, for which people should be saving. Then, too, we must remember that everyone has a responsibility as a citizen to exercise restraint in his spending and to save as much as possible. Saving stores up purchasing power for the future, and has a national, as well as personal, significance; it is a bulwark against postwar depression. The temptation to spend extravagantly will be very strong as the Christmas season approaches, Christmas is always characterized by free spending. 'This year, with spirits somewhat lifted because of the war outlook and with money plentiful, restraint will be extremely difficult. The wise woman will recognize the temptation. She will be fully aware that many standard articles are not available, and that most articles that are available are high priced and of wartime quality. She will appreciate the fact that, in the light of the war situation, many merchants are anxious to reduce wartime stocks and she will not be influenced by special inducements to buy. She will consider more carefully than ever before the significance of Christmas giving, and her Christmas remembrances will be the expression of her thoughtfulness, careful planning, and personal effort, rather than to represent money expenditures. Her necessary purchases will be made with a full appreciation and understanding of values. Her spending will be conservative and wise.
