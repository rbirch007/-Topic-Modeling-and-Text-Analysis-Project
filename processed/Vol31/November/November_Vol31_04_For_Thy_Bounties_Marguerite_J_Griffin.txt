For Thy Bounties Marguerite 66 OTHER, I want to tell you about something that happened at school." It was my oldest son. May he never get too old to tell me things! May I never be too busy, nor hurried to listen! "Well, you know we usually have current events first. Thing 1 the morning, but today the teacher said more I gasped went on. "Then she asked how many of us say grace at home, and, Mother, out of the whole room I was the only one to raise my hand." His eyes were wide with wonder. "Well, Son, there must have been others who live in homes where ace is said. Perhaps they just Jacked courage to admit it after the had so emphatically expressed her opinion." And that ls what I'd like to believe. I hope that schoolroom does not represent 4 typical cross section of this great nation. Bow your head in gratitude for the plentiful plates of nourishing food that you consume three times a day? Have you forgotten your Pilgrim Fathers who, after their first harvest, themselves on bended knee to give thanks to God their Heavenly Father, who had rewarded their efforts in this new land with the needs for sustaining life? Page 616 . Griffin They were mindful of him who had sent the sun and rain upon the earth, that it might give forth its abundance. 'They had felt his protection in the trial they had passed through and now, in their plenty, they did -not forget. Yes, because of them we have our Thanksgiving Day once a years but to many of us it has become synonymous with turkey, plum puddings, and pies. I have sat at bounteous spreads in many homes, grateful for the. Associations of friends, grateful for companionship, smelling the savory odors of appetizing food, enjoying the happy conversation, and there has not been one moment's pause to give thanks to anticipation for food. And yet not 4 guest would leave until he had thanked his hostess and praised her wonderful meal. It would have been the greatest preach of etiquette not to have 'zed the gifted hands who had done the cooking or, at least, had planned it. She had made the most of every flavor and spice. She them harmoniously. She had served them so they were an art to the eye as well as to the Yes, praise her, indeed. But who gave life to the turkey? Who gave flavor and color to the vegetables, orange to the cat rot, green to the peas, white to the potato? Who gave richness to the grain, and sweetness to the sugar beet? FOR THY BOUNTIES Had he not done his part where would Our hostess have been? Yet, three times a day some sit down to this miracle of nature without a word, THE Words of the Prayer matter little, if they come from the heart. What counts most is the gratitude, the appreciation that bursts into glowing warmth in the soul, the peace of mind that soothes tired nerves. Gratitude is to the heart as rain to the flower. It makes all its beauty glitter with a brightness greater than diamonds. Without the ability to appreciate, which is a finer form of gratitude, a man cannot truly love. He cannot respond with joy to the beauties of life and nature. And
there is nothing more necessary than to be grateful for the common things of daily living. We Americans have had so much. Our land has yielded harvest after harvest so abundantly, that some have fallen into the lethargy of taking it all for granted. A warm glass of milk, a bright red, ripe tomato, juicy and cold— We forget what miracles they really are! We take a morsel and leave the rest half eaten on our plates. We butter a piece of bread heavily and leave the crust, bread which only last season was a golden sheaf of grain, warmed by the sun, nurtured by the rain. If the sun had been too hot too long, if the rain had
never come, or, if coming, had never given way to the blue of sky, the grain might not have been. And then the bread? We do not think of that. We only know that each day we have our bread. We think we will always have our bread, but
"man does not live by bread alone." 617 Remember the Story of the Savior feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fishes? And Jesus took the loaves; and when
he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.  There's the story complete, with a brevity modern narrators should envy. The importance of this story to me is not, however, in the miraculous feeding of the five thousand. It is in the Man who was their host. The Man who gave thanks for the food, and then when it was eaten sent his
disciples forth to gather up the fragments “that nothing be lost." This
very act establishes him as a Man different and superior to other men. Call to your mind men who magnanimously flaunt their wealth before the people. Is it not natural for a person such as this, elevating himself in his own power, hoping to
be esteemed in the eyes of his fellows to say: “Oh, don’t bother with the remnants. There is more where that came from." Not so with the Son of God. His appreciation of the things of life was great enough that he gave thanks upon food he had the power to magnify a thousand times, and then he carefully gathered up what was left "That nothing might be lost” – and that twelve baskets full. So then— "In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
