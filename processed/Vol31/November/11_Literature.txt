VOL. 31 NOVEMBER 1944 NO. 11 Birthday Greetings to President Heber Gg. Grant T Latter-day Saints the month of November is: especially significant, for in this month occurs the anniversary of the birth of our greatly beloved and deeply revered president, Heber J. Grant. Upon this important occasion we extend to him through the columns of the Magazine, which represents the great multitude of women of the Relief Society, greetings, congratulations, and heartfelt good wishes. In our homes we express daily in our prayers our gratitude and thanks for the leadership, the splendid life, and righteous achievements of this great and good man, and we pray for his continued welfare. While he will be thus remembered by the people of the Church everywhere at this time, yet we take this opportunity, which we deem a great pleasure and high privilege, to salute him in behalf of the great Relief Society organization on this his eighty-eighth birthday, and to wish for him a realization of all that his heart desires. We are sure that one of his heart's greatest desires is that the members of the Church strive daily to live in strict accordance with the teachings of the gospel of the Master, and that they devote themselves to the building up of the kingdom of God. The fulfillment or accomplishment of this desire would be to him a priceless birthday gift. President Grant has always been Page 630 a true friend to the women of the Church. He has recognized their contributions to the welfare and development of the Church, and he has honored them in their various callings. He has encouraged them to go forward in auxiliary activities and has aided and. Supported them in their organization work. For this generous attitude toward women, and this whole-souled recognition of their abilities and service, we are deeply grateful. We are mindful especially of his interest in the various phases of Relief Society work, and we wholeheartedly express our love and gratitude for all that he has done for our treasured Society. President Grant's conception of the scope and value of Relief Society work dates back to his early youth, when his widowed mother served as a ward president at the same time that he and she were struggling together to carry the economic problems that surrounded them in their own home, in those early pioneer days.. It was thus from his mother, who went about doing good, giving spiritual as well as practical help to those in sorrow and need, that he first learned some of those lessons which have helped to make of him the great humanitarian and spiritual leader that he is today.
