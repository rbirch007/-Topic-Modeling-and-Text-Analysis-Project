What an Old Trunk May Bring Forth William R. Palmer ANY of the old trunks that survived the battering of a steerage ocean voyage on sailing vessels, and crossed the continent in ox-team caravans contained treasures of china and pewter and copper and exquisite needlework that looked strangely out of place in the primitive log homes they were brought to Zion to adorn. Some were treasured heirlooms that had heart values far beyond any price that. Might be put upon them, and some were parting gifts from beloved relatives or friends whose faces might never again be seen. Our pioneer mothers polished their pewter and copper to jewel-like brightness and put them on the roughhewn mantelpieces of their first log homes, and they hung their fine needlework upon the rough but whitewashed walls. Looking through tear-dimmed eyes upon these treasures, they saw in them the link between the roughhewn homes of the wilderness and the refinements they had left behind. Many of these treasured keepsakes fell into hands that knew not their value, and, with the passing of the mothers who cherished them, became mere junk for the children to destroy. Others were packed reverently back into the battered old trunk with grandma's horsehair bonnet and the clothing she would never wear again. There they lay untouched Page 626 and forgotten until some descendant, impelled by curiosity to see what grandma wore, brought them again to the light of day. Such a trunk was opened in Kanarraville, in 1939, and it yielded a real treasure of needle-- craft to a family who knew grandma only as a tradition. On the night of May 16, 1869, the waiting days of Mariah Davies Davies were all fulfilled, and she went down into the Valley of the Shadow of Death from which she never returned. In the morning, a daughter was born, and two hours later the mother's eyes were closed in death. They laid her away in the little cemetery at Kanarraville and then the sorrowing husband, with the aid of Martha, his eldest daughter, and "Aunt Betsy," his wife's cousin, packed her keepsakes with her clothing into the old steamer trunk that had brought them from Wales. In July 1870, John J. Davies married "Aunt Betsy," but she, knowing what the trunk contained, never opened it. For twenty years they lived happily together, and in August 1890, she died. Martha Williams, that eldest daughter, took her father, John J. Davies, to her home to spend the remainder of his days. The old trunk came too, and that was the last move it ever made. More years passed and John J. Davies died, then Martha died, and lastly her husband, Rees J. Williams. The old home became the property WHAT AN OLD TRUNK MAY BRING FORTH of Bishop Wells A. Williams, their son. ONE day in 1939, Bishop Williams and his good wife decided to * look into grandfather's old trunk in the attic. Since the death of the Bishop's mother its hinges had never turned. Folded carefully away in the bottom they found the sampler shown in the photograph above. Art teachers and all who see it pronounce it one of the most exquisite pieces of needlework they have ever seen. It is twenty inches square. The work is so fine that it requires a magnifying glass to reveal that many different stitches have been employed in developing the various figures. It was done in Carmarthenshire, Wales, in the year 1846, and Mariah Davies, the girl who did it, was then only thirteen years of age. Her work is flawless. The beauty of this rare sampler lies not alone in its exquisite needlework but in the dainty loveliness and refinement of its color scheme as well. Done in daintiest pastel shades of brown and pinks and reds, the interest of a spectator alternates between the delicate perfection of craftsmanship and the grace of its colors and shades. One could never tire of looking at it. Moths, unfortunately, have done some damage to the fabric, but the pattern and the colors are as clear and dainty and bright as the day the piece was finished. It will soon be a century old. Mariah Davies was first baptized into the Mormon Church the year she finished this masterpiece of needlecraft—1846. In 1852, she was re-baptized, (a customary thing in those days) and John J. Davies, the man she was destined to marry two years later, became a member of the Church at the same time. Brother Davies was a weaver by trade, and in Zion, his young wife soon became proficient in that craft also. In the early months of 1855, in the employ of "Sister Mackeny," they wove five hundred yards of carpet for use in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. They also wove one hundred yards of cloth for Bailey Lake to get flour to feed themselves and their babies. Many descendants from this worthy Welsh couple are scattered through the Church, and most of them, perhaps, have never seen nor heard of this exquisite piece of fine art that was done by the skilled fingers of their grandmother.
