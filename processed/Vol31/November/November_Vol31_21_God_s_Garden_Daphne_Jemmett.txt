GOD'S GARDEN Daphne Jemmett Down in a rocky canyon Close by the Blackfoot River, Deep in the heart of the mountains, Is the strangest garden ever. Roses huge, and cabbages Lying side by side, Hewn from out the solid rock, And strewn on the wild hillside. I wonder if some giant Playing with rock-like clay Fashioned the roses and cabbages And then threw them away; Or did God make a garden there And then just let it stay, A monument to gardening? Forever?and a day? the Gift of Gifts Trade B National BIBLES Since 1863...
