Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman’s Exponent, Feb 1, and Feb 15, 1884 “The Rights of the Women of Zion, and the Rights of the Women of all Nations.” An Ovation: On Monday, January 21st Sister Eliza R. Snow Smith, President of the Latter-day Saint Women's Organizations, received such an ovation as is seldom accorded to a woman. The party met in the Social Hall at 5 p. m. and the exercises began about six o'clock. President John Taylor made some preliminary remarks suitable to the occasion, and congratulated Sister Eliza on having arrived at the age of four score years. A good spirit seemed to rest upon all assembled to pay this tribute of respect to a veteran mother in Israel. . . . * * * The Sixteenth Annual Washington Convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association: Will be held in Lincoln Hall, Washington, D.C., March 4th, 5th, and 6th, 1884. Public sessions will be held at 2 and 7:30 p. m. on each of these days, and Executive Sessions, open only to officers and members of the Association, will be held daily at 10:30 a.m. . . . The principal object of this Association from its organization, has been to secure to the women of the several States and Territories national protection in the Citizens Right to Vote, through a Sixteenth Amendment to the National Constitution. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, President. * * * Miscellaneous: The Woman's Journal will henceforth number among its occasional contributors Louisa M. Alcott, Mary F. Eastman and Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. Will somebody tell us if there is a chaos of unrocked cradles, undarned socks and buttonless shirts in Washington Territory — now that the women vote? Editorial Notes: The Picture Entitled, "Representative Women," and dedicated to Sister Eliza R. S. Smith .... is now ready .... There is a book of pen-sketches of about 140 pages, which will enhance the interest of the picture. *** Manti Items: At the commencement of another cycle of time we desire to inform our favorite organ that we are still living and endeavoring to live the lives of Latter-day Saints, and that the Manti North Ward Relief Society is up and doing deeds of kind-ness— like He who suffered on the cross — let their good works testify .... Those who are in trouble find a father, benefactor and comforter in our Bishop; a mother, sister and sympathizer in our beloved president, Sister Rebecca Wareham, and the members of the Relief Society. * * * * Pretty napkins for trays and fruit dishes are of cream colored momie cloth, with designs of grapes, peaches, plums and apples, mingled with their leaves. The work is either in Kensington or etching style, and the napkins are finished with a border of drawn work and a knotted fringe.
