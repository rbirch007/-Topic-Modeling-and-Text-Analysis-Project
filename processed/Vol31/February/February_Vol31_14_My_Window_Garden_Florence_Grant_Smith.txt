My Window Garden Florence Grant Smith OUR years ago, we decided to modernize our kitchen and pantry. When the measurements were taken, we found that Our pantry was large enough to be made into a breakfast room. It contained one small window in an east wall. Here was my chance to have what I had always wanted, a window large enough to hold plants and flowers to my heart's content! I had thumbed through magazines with this thought in mind and found a picture of just the window I was sure could be built into our wall. It was a conservatory type that would extend beyond the house wall, and required the removal of almost all the east wall of the room in order to set the window in place. A local glass company made the metal frame and set the glass. This frame, glass enclosed, with two plate-glass shelves, extends twelve inches beyond the house wall. It is five feet high, seven feet wide, and with the depth of the frame and the thickness of the wall, I have a twenty-inch window sill. Buff tile was selected to cover the sill as that was considered the most Practical finish for a sill where plants were to be cared for. A light-blue color was chosen for the wall covering, and rayon taffeta drapes in a peach color were hung at the window. Now came the fun of making my indoor garden. This was something new in the house, and the whole family was interested in the outcome. J consulted a local gardener as to what Page 100 type of plants would do best in such a setting. This window being on the east and only getting the sun for about two hours each day would have to have plants and flowers that needed not so much sun as a good light. I found that there are many beautiful plants that thrive in just such a place. I selected those that would give us both color and blossoms dur. Ing the winter. While the family is enjoying a meal, I can look up and see my Dutch boy with his heavy shoes, dark-blue flare-pants, light-blue shirt with a white vest, and a funny Dutch cap on the back of his head. With hands in his pockets, he is slyly looking at a little Dutch gitl, whose hair, parted in the middle of her forehead to the nape of her neck, is braided into two rosettes over her ears. She wears a light-blue laced bodice with white collar and cuffs, a buff skirt, short white socks and large Dutch shoes. She is bashfully holding her face away from the little boy, while she hides a red apple behind her back. Then, I see several colorful Hummel Pieces: little soldiers marching to the rhythm of the drum and the music of their own voices; a darling little maid with a basket at her feet, sitting on a pole fence watching the performance of the boys, while two cherubs are singing to the tune of the instruments they are playing. There is a duck with a garden on its broad back; a white elephant striding through drooping ferns, greencrackled glass tumblers, and a blue glass vase through which the light Y sister who ]j ?ach leaf appears, a Ossoms unfolds, Then long and Strag- of a garden as the one who takes care of it, loving every plant growing there. That is another thing which friends mention?the care it must take to have such a place. True, it does take time and care, but everything else in a home does also, and the time spent in caring for the plants is small in comparison to the joy we all get out of seeing them. The time we love our garden-window the most is when "Old Man Winter" gets busy with one of his blustery storms and sends the wind and snow beating against the window panes. The room is warm and cosy with the flowers all in blossom, giving us a wonderful feeling in contrast to the storm. It was at such a time as this that Daddy Smith remarked: "I just love to eat here where the flowers are all in bloom while the storm is raging outside." We all agreed, for winter takes on a different look entirely when viewed from a window framed in green, and bright with fresh flowers!  A Bride Goes West (Continued from page 94) sent for the Indian te-wat. A little school was soon organized and the Indian children listened attentively, but they enjoyed the singing the most. How a chance traveler must have smiled as his ears caught the New England church hymns sung by the dark-skinned Indians in this school so far away in the wilderness! Dr. Whitman traveled far and wide among his beloved Indians and Narcissa taught in her school. The mission house became larger as additions were added for the school and many store rooms, but the kitchen was the spot of interest for all. We can imagine this New England girl teaching her adopted Indian children to cook as she walked around and stepped over lazy Indian braves, for her home was a home for the Indians! She had proved that white women could cross the continent and help carry the white man's Book to the Indians. These missionaries opened Oregon to American families, and it was from the doorway of Narcissa's home that she stood and saw her husband guide the first wagon train to Oregon in the year 1843.  LIFE IS LIKE A GARDEN A HUMAN life may be likened to a garden. It requires sun, air, water, and good soil. But without cultivation these may produce merely rank weeds?the richer the soil the worse the weeds. The desired plants must be encouraged. These are the virtues that give strength and beauty to life. The weeds must be uprooted. These are the vices and indulgences that keep us from being our true selves. The weeds spring from our ignorance or indifference or are sown in our lives by selfish interests which wish to reap a profit from our indulgences. It is hard for us to recognize the weeds because it is natural for us to make ourselves think that whatever we do is right. One's ability to examine his own weaknesses fairly and to seek ways to correct them is a measure of his intelligence and selfmastery.?Joy Elmer Morgan, The Tyranny of Bad Habits.
