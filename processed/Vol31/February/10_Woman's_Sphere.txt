Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon SELFLESS, unmercenary Nurse Kenny at fourteen was worried about her young brother's lack of muscular development. She read everything available on muscles and set up a dummy with a muscular system of ropes and pulleys for experimentation. She turned Bill into a husky young man who was decorated in the last war. Later, she declined marriage in order to mother humanity. Her treatment of infantile paralysis was diametrically opposed to current medical practice which placed the affected parts in splints or casts for a complete rest. She thought this treatment inconsistent, as the muscle-spasms caused shortening which in turn caused deformity. The technique which Nurse Kenny sponsors today consists in using hot fomentations, and, by skilled handling, she teaches the muscles their former behavior-pattern. She also teaches them their path to the brain, which has usually become lost when the muscles tried to work under acute suffering. Students work with her two years to acquire her method. She is accomplishing miracles. HERE are some books, written for the young, but equally interesting to adults, which will help to widen our horizons: The Welcome, by Babette Deutsch (Harper's), which is a story of an American boy's growth in understanding through his acquaintance with a boy refugee; They Came From France, by Clara I. Judson (Junior Literary Guild, New York, and Houghton Mifflin); Hosh-ki. The Navajo, by Florence Hayes (Random House), a book rich in Indian background; The White Stag, by Kate Seredy (Viking Press), a beautifully written story of Hungary's legendary history. ON October 19, 1943, Fannie C. Harper, wife of the late John C. Harper of Colonia Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, celebrated her eightieth anniversary by giving a recital to an appreciative audience that filled the Ivins Hall to capacity. The recital consisted of the presentation of a choice selection of poems and favorite passages of Scripture that Mrs. Harper had memorized at various times throughout her life. Mrs. Harper has lived in Colonia Juarez for more than fifty years, and for thirty-four years she has been a widow. She has made an independent and comfortable living from keeping an open house both for regular boarders and transient travelers. IN the United States, in 1942, there were 9,200,000 accidents and 93,000 deaths. Of these, 4,600,000 were home accidents with 30,000 deaths. The Parent-Teacher Association has pamphlets which every woman should possess, discussing methods of increasing safety at home and in the streets. Application should be made at the organization centers. Page 95
