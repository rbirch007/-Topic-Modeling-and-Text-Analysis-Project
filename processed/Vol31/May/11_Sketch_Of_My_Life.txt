Sketch Of My Life Eliza R. Snow Smith CHAPTER III WE were traveling in the season, significantly "between hay and grass," and the teams feeding on browse obtained by felling trees, wasted in flesh and had but little strength; and at times, it was painful to see the poor creatures straining every joint and ligature?doing their best, and looking the very picture of discouragement. When crossing the low lands, where Spring rains had soaked the mellow soil, they frequently stalled on level ground, and we could move only by coupling teams, which made very slow progress. From the effects of chills and fever, I had not strength to walk, or I would not have been guilty of riding after those half-famished animals. Most of the time I was obliged to tide, no matter how dangerous it might be on roads formed by the hand of nature. In some instances, a cow and ox? and frequently two cows were yoked together: and these poor animals, after helping draw wagons through the day, at night furnished all the milk with which the family was supplied; but the yield was a small pittance, especially when divided among a number of tired, hungry, houseless, little ones. It would require a painter's skill and pencil to represent an encampment where we stopped, as we frequently did, to give the jaded teams a chance to recuperate, and the people to straighten Page 272 up matters and things generally. Here is a slight touch from my journal. "Our town of yesterday has grown to a city?laid out in a half-hollow square, fronting East and South on a beautiful level, on one side an almost perpendicular, and on the other, a gradual descent into a deep ravine, which defines it on the North and West. At nine o'clock this morning, I noticed a Blacksmith's shop in full blast, and everything, everywhere, indicating local industries of real life. Only the sick are idle.. Not a stove or cooking utensil, but is called into requisition; while tubs and wash-boards, etc., are taken one-half mile distant, where washing is done by the side of a stream of water. I join Mrs. M. [Markham] in the washing department, and get a Buggyride to the scene of action, as a spectator, where the boys have the fire in waiting: while others of our mess (21 in number) stop in the city and do the cooking arrangements; and for our dinner, send us a rich portion of their immense potpie, made of rabbits, squirrels, pheasants, quails, prairie chickens, etc., etc., trophies of the success of our hunters, of whom, each Division has its quota. ?Thus, from time to time we are supplied with fresh meat." I will now attempt a description of a prairie fire, and then, as am writing merely "a sketch," I shall pass hastily forward. SKETCH OF MY LIFE MOSQUITO CREEK 273 At this place on the Pioneer Trail a conference was held At our encampment at the head waters of the Grand River, we saw a fire in the distance coming rapidly towards us with tremendous fury. Our men turned out enmasse, and set fires to burn a broad extent around our premises, for the wind was so strong, that, without this precaution, the fire would have swept over us almost instantaneously. So soon as we felt secured, we gazed with admiration and astonishment at the terrific grandeur of the bewildering scene before us, as the devouring element rolled in awful volumes over the tall, dry grass, interspersed with leafless trees as dry as tinder?the flames rising at times, to the height of forty or fifty feet, and shooting, as if drawn by powerful attraction, from tree to tree. I had often read and listened to descriptions of "Prairies on fire," with the dangers to which travelers are exposed in consequence, and had thought those accounts over-drawn, but now I can say in truth, that the reality "beggars all description." I now pass hurriedly over the founding of the settlement called Pisgah?the unjust requisition of Government in calling out the Mormon Battalion and consequent hardships devolving on the women and children, as they have long since become subjects of history. When we left Pisgah, Col. M. [Markham] was minus one teamster, and Mrs. M. [Markham] to avoid having another to cook for, proposed to drive the gentle, well-trained yoke of oxen which was selected for the wagon she and I were to occupy; but soon after we started, she was taken quite ill, and of course, the driving fell to me. Had it been a horse team, I should have been amply qualified, but driving oxen 274 was entirely new business. However, I took the whip and very soon learned to haw and gee, and acquitted myself very well in driving most of the way to "Winter Quarters" (now Florence) the cattle being so pliable that I could sit and drive. At the best, I was often much fatigued, the family at times having so much sickness, that I had to cook as well as nurse, and I was truly thankful for strength to do for those from whom I received much kindness. On the 2d we arrived at our "Winter Quarters" where we joined the general Camp. From exposure and hardship I was taken sick soon after with a slow fever, and as I lay sick in the wagon, where my bed was exposed to heavy rains, and, at times, unavoidably wet from head to foot, I realized that I was near the gate of death; but in this suffering and exposed condition, I did not feel that God had forsaken me?my trust was in Him, and His power preserved me. While passing through this trying scene, I not only realized the goodness of God, but experienced many kindnesses from my sisters, whose names are not only written in my Journal, but also are engraven on my heart; and I never shall forget the unceasing kindness of brother and sister Markham, with whom I journeyed from Nauvoo to this winter stopping-point. At the time of which I am writing, many were sick around me, and under the circumstances, no one could be properly cared for. Although exposed to Autumnal rains in the wagon? worse was yet to come. On the 28th of October, a company starting out for supplies, required the wagon which sister M. [Markham] and I occupied: and the house we moved into, having been built of logs, with openings only partly chinked and mudded?the wind cold and blustering, found plenty of crevices on the sides through which to play; while the roof was shingled only on one side, with a tent-cloth thrown over the other: and besides, it was minus a chimney, and when a fire was kindled, the smoke so filled the house, that a breathing apparatus was of little use, and the fire was put outside. Mrs. M. [Markham] had partially recovered from her sickness, but was feeble?I was not able to sit up long, and under the circumstances, having to dispense with a fire, I had to keep my bed. The men had so much to do in preparing for winter, our circumstances were much the same?cooking done out of doors, etc., until past the middle of November, when our chimney was built ? the house chinked, and other improvements added, which we were prepared to appreciate. About the last of December I received the sad news of the death of my mother, in which, although accompanied with a feeling of heavy bereavement, I realized a _ sweet, soothing sensation in the thought that she was free from all earthly ills. She had lived to a good age, and been a patient participator in the scenes of suffering through the persecutions of the Saints. Her mortal remains sleep in peace?her grave, and that of my father, whose death preceded hers less than a year, are side by side, in Walnut Grove, Knox Co., Illinois. The privations, hardships, and exposures to which we had been subjected, combined with the unhealthiness SKETCH OF MY LIFE of the climate of our Winter Quarters, caused much sickness, and sickness increased destitution: but in the midst of all, we enjoyed ranch of the Spirit of God, and many seasons of refreshing from His Presence. My life, as well as the lives of many others, was preserved by the power of God, through faith; and not on natural principles, as comprehended by man. Our extensive encampment was divided into Wards, and so organized that meetings were held in each Ward. An order was introduced that each able-bodied man, should: either give the labor of each tenth ay, Or contribute an equivalent, for the support of the destitute, and to aid those families whose husbands and sons were in the Battalion, and those who were "widows indeed," On the 7th of April, 1847, President Brigham Young with his band of pioneer braves, started in search of a home for the Saints, in the mountains of the desert. THe first emigrant company started early in June. Brother and sister Robert Pierce kindly offered me a seat in their carriage, which was left vacant by the death of their daughter Mary, a Promising young lady, who had fallen a victim to the sickly climate; and on the 12th of June, we bade Goodbye to many dear friends, and again started on pilgrimage, Previous to starting for an indefinite point?probably one thousand miles into the interior, and from all supplies, the idea of an outfit was a very important consideration. Some of our brethren had purchased and 275 local Store with some of the necessaries and comforts for journeying, was to start immediately, and what Its extent must the amount of On examining my purse, found it contained one dime (ten cents)?I was nearly minus ink?[ After we started out from Winter Quarters, three consumed in maneuvering and making a "good ready," ed place for rendezvous, a general meeting was held around a Liberty Pole, erected for that purpose, and 4n Organization effected similar to that entered into after leaving Nauvoo. Also, at our next point, on the Platte River, a Liberty Pole was erected, from which our National Flag floated gracefully on the breeze. How dear to the heart of an Ameri. Can, has that sacred emblem ever been! And, although at that time, it yielded us no protection?although we were homeless exiles, the wave of the "Dear old Flag," seemed fraught with that inspiration which silently breathes a promise of peace. As we moved forward, one Division after another?sometimes in Fifties?sometimes in Tens?but seldom traveling in Hundreds, we passed and repassed each other, but at night kept as compact as circumstances would admit, especially when in the Indian country. Not knowing how our "ted brethren" might feel disposed toward us, it was admitted that caution was the Parent of safety. East of F ort Laramie, many of the Sioux nation mixed with our traveling camps?sometimes in our front and sometimes in ?By permission and courtesy of American Pioneer Trails Association BUFFALO STAMPEDE, our rear, on their way to the Fort, where their national Council was in Session. We had no other trouble with them than the loss of a few cooking utensils, which, when unobserved, they light-fingered; except in one instance, when our Ten had been left in the rear to repair a broken wagon, until late in the night. It was bright moonlight, and as we were passing one of their encampments, they formed in a line closely by the roadside, and, when our teams were passing they simultaneously and vigorously shook their blankets to frighten the teams and cause a stampede; however no serious injury occurred, although the animals were dreadfully frightened?cows broke their fastenings, oxen turned their bows, and horses pranced and trembled, while some of the weaker human nerves were not altogether proof against the unanticipated scare. Those Indians carried their tents and baggage on horses, mules and on drays formed of tent-poles, and drawn by horses, mules, and dogs: covers for the little ones were made by fastening skins over bows fixed to the upper side of the drays. We had two fearful stampedes while on this journey?the first was in the evening?the animals were in a corral formed by placing the wagons and carriages side by side, with the tongues on the outside of the hollow square, to which open spaces were left on two sides, for ingress and egress. The wagon in which I had retired for the night was either second or third from one of these openings, and to this gateway the animals all rushed?bellowing, puffing, and snorting, while they rushed against, and clambered over and upon- SKETCH OF MY LIFE 
each other in heaps, above the wagon-tops, and so frightened that it was some time before they succeeded in breaking through the gateway of rushing their escape. The scene was horrible! Some animals died of injuries?many had their horns knocked off, which produced pitiful sights. The trouble was occasioned by a person shaking the dust from a buffalo robe, which frightened the near animals?they started others to run, and the contagion spread almost instantaneously thro' the entire herd. The camp necessarily halted for the recovery of the runaways, most of which were found the next day.
The second stampede occurred in the day-time. We had stopped to repair a dilapidated crossing over a broad slough?the teams were standing two, three, and four abreast; and from the top, nearly to the bottom of a gentle slope, facing the hands at work, when two men on mules, with blankets swinging, rode galloping past?frightening the back teams, and they started on a rush forward, which started others, and soon nearly every vehicle was in motion with fearful velocity, the drivers absent, and women and children in wagons, carriages, and others still more exposed, standing where they were in danger of being crushed by the reckless flying wheels. With tearful velocity, heedless of crossings and bridges, those teams whirled their vehicles across the slough where, it was admitted that the most skillful teamster could not have succeeded. I was sitting alone on the back seat of a carriage, holding the reins of a high-spirited span?vehicles were flitting past?the horses made several jumps, and I knew
very well, if they really got started, no human power could prevent them stripping everything to strings. While I held them with all my strength, I braced with all the faculty of my soul. Mrs. Pierce and her daughter Margaret, with whom I was journeying, being out of the carriage when the scene occurred, had been trying to stop some oxteams, but finding they could not succeed they came, one on each side, and caught the horses by the bits; they stopped prancing, but shook all over like a person with the shaking ague. Whatever skeptics may say, I attribute my preservation at that time to the peculiar and special blessing of God. And not only mine, but that of others: in the midst of the many fearful exposures, no one was seriously hurt.
Much of the time we journeyed on untrod ground, but occasionally we struck the track of the Pioneers and read the date of their presence, with an "All well" accompaniment inscribed on a bleached buffalo skull, and had a general time of rejoicing. Those skulls were duly appreciated; but at times, the tremendous herds of live buffaloes were very annoying, especially when crossing their watering paths in near proximity to a river, and we were compelled to make a break in a line of wagons, and wait for two or three thousand of those uncompromising animals to pass.
We had many seasons of rejoicing in the midst of privation and many sufferings?many manifestations of the loving kindness of God. In very many instances the sick were healed, and those who by accidents were nigh unto death, made speedily whole. I will mention one case that came under my immediate 278 observation. Mrs. Love, an intimate friend of mine, fell from the tongue of her wagon, containing sixteen hundred freight; the wheels ran across her breast as she lay prostrate, and to all appearance, she was crushed, but on being administered to by some of the elders, she revived; and after having been anointed with consecrated oil, and having the ordinance of laying on of hands repeated she soon recovered, and on the fourth day after the accident, she milked her cow, as usual. Many, yes many were the star and moonlight evenings, when, as we circled around the blazing fire and sang our hymns of devotion and songs of praise to Him who knows the secrets of all hearts?when with sublime union of hearts, the sound of united voices reverberated from hill to hill; and echoing through the silent expanse, apparently filled the vast concave above, while the glory of God seemed to rest on all around us. On one of these soul-inspiring occasions?prompted by the spirit of Song, I wrote the following: SONG OF THE DESERT Beneath the cloud-topp'd mountain? Beside the craggy bluff, Where every dint of nature Is wild and rude enough: Upon the verdant meadow? Upon the sun-burnt plain? Upon the sandy hillock, We waken music's strain, Beneath the pine-tree branches Which have for ages stood? Beneath the humble cedar, And the green cotton-wood: Beside the broad smooth river? Beside the flowing spring? Beside the limpid streamlet, We often sit and sing. Beneath the sparkling concave, When stars in millions come To cheer the weary strangers And bid us feel at home. Amid the cheering moon-light, Fair Cynthia's mellow Tays In social groups we gather, And join in songs of praise, Cheer'd by the blaze of fire-light, When evening shadows fall, And when the darkness deepens Around our spacious hall;, With true and warm emotion To saintly bosoms given, In strains of pure devotion We praise the God of heaven.

Since the inception of the points-for-fat program, there has been an increase in the household fat collections. Housewives over the entire nation have responded enthusiastically to this new arrangement. However, the nation is still far behind the quotas set by the War Production Board. Official figures show that we have only one-third of the required stockpile of glycerine, which is the vital ingredient obtained from fats.?Official Salvage News Bulletin "
