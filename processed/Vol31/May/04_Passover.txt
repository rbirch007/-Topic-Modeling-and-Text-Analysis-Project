Passover—Unleavened Bread F east, Nisan 16th. As we have already noted, personal attendance was necessary on the first two days only of this seven-daylong feast. 'The first and the last of the feast days were "holy convocations"; the intermediate days were "half-holidays," or days of "minor festival" or "Moed Katon." On the first day, the Paschal lamb had been killed and eaten and the necessary burnt offering had been made; on the second day, Joseph had offered his peace offering or "festive sacrifice," and in the evening of that day (though strictly by Jewish reckoning, the beginning of the next day), the "first-sheaf" had been garnered and threshed and the omer of flour waved and offered to the Lord. These were the full essentials for which personal presence was required. Joseph and Mary and Jesus were now free to return home, for "they had fulfilled the days." Did they so return or did they Stay in Jerusalem till the Feast of Unleavened Bread was ended? Scholars are not agreed on this point, some believing they did remain, others that they did not. 227/ Edersheim I, P. 246; The Temple, PP. 215, 224 ff. Page 250 While the matter does not seem to be one of final consequence, yet it has an interest and bearing as to the place in the Temple grounds where Jesus met the doctors, though this point is not of last importance, either, the one essential point being that He did meet the doctors and that He "astonished" them with both His "hearing them, and asking them questions." Those scholars who interpret the statement, "when they had fulfilled the days" as meaning that Joseph and Mary remained the full days of the Feast, declare (some of them) that Jesus met the doctors in a synagogue that was on the Temple grounds, or (as others affirm) that He met them in a theological academy (Beth-ha-Midrash ) that was within the Temple precincts." Edersheim critically — examines these suggestions and concludes there is no historical evidence that a Synagogue existed within the Temple enclosure and that if one did exist, the services therein held would not admit of the recorded incident of the interview between Jesus and the doctors. Edersheim also concludes there was no theological seminary in the enclosure and that if there had been Jesus would not have been admitted 228/ Andrews, Pp. 108 ff. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS thereto. On the other hand, he points out that the Talmud affirms "the members of the Temple Sanhedrin, who on ordinary days sat as a Court of Appeal, from the close of the Morning—to the time of the Evening Sacrifice, were wont on Sabbaths and feast days to come out upon 'the Terrace' of the Temple, and there to teach. In such popular instruction the utmost latitude of questioning would be given. It is in this audience, which sat on the ground, surrounding and mingling with the Doctors—and hence during not after the Feast—that we must seek the Child Jesus.""It is rather in the intimacy and informality of such a gathering as Edersheim describes, that we should expect to find the Youth. We shall in the rest of this article work on Edersheim's conclusions. O we come to the third day of the Feast, Nisan the 16th. We shall assume that Joseph and Mary began the return journey on this day. As we have already seen, in Palestine the first day of a journey was always a short one" The morning would doubtless be spent in preparation for the home-going, in paying goodbye visits and saying farewell to friends. The returning pilgrims would start in the late afternoon, to escape the heat of the sun; they would expect to travel only six or eight miles. While perhaps not so great as when coming to the Passover (for then they had with them large numbers of sacrificial animals), nevertheless the confusion of the many streams of returning worshipers coming from 251 various parts of the city and emptying into the few roads leading northward, the din from the shouts of the camel drivers and the muleteers, the screams of mothers whose children were in danger of being trodden underfoot, the shrieks of the children themselves, the loud greetings of village friends, now homeward-bound, meeting for the first time since they came to the Passover, the anxious calls of parents seeking to gather their families together, the braying of the donkeys, the laughter, the singing—all combined to make a tumult that would never be forgotten. As they went along the road, families would be constantly reunited as the older children, traveling for a time with friends, searched out their own parents and brothers and sisters. So the slow-moving multitude, unorganized and undirected, would creep steadily forward as the sun lowered and sank in the west, then on through the fast fading twilight, into the darkness, when flaring torches added to the picturesque weirdness of this plodding, on-marching mass—all winding like a giant, sluggish, flickering, dull-lighted glowworm over hills, down and out of ravines, around bluffs, until, the day's journey finished, camp was made, the evening meal eaten, and as the dying fires, casting huge, weird, shifting shadows, finally flickered out, quiet came and night and the stillness of the desert settled down over the weary mass. Tradition gives Beer or El Birch (a town some ten miles northward 229/ Edersheim I, pp. 246-247; ibid. II, p. 742 App. X; Geikie, I, p. 225; Farrar's Life of Christ, p. 40; Thev. 30, P- 718. 230/ Thev. 30, p. 718; Andrews, p. 109. 252 from Jerusalem) as the site of the first stop of the returning pilgrims. Edersheim, however, is quoted as saying the first stop was made at Sichem, "if the direct road north through Samaria was taken." Remembering that Jesus was now a "son of the law," entitled to wear if not wearing the Tephillin or phylacteries," we can realize that He would not be under such strict supervision as when younger. He would be given greater responsibility and freedom. Furthermore, maturity comes earlier in the than with us would come three or four years later. It is not strange, therefore, that His absence from the group was not detected until the evening camp was reached, when Joseph and Mary found Him not "among their kinsfolk and acquaintance." Then they returned to Jerusalem to find Him. Authorities are not a unit on the question of the period covered by the expression "after three days they found him in the temple." Was the day of departure from Jerusalem the first, the day of their return to Jerusalem the second, and the day of their finding Him in the Temple the third; or was the day of their return the first, a day of searching the second, and the day He was found the third? "Some with much less probability, count three days from the day of their return." However, this point has no real apparent importance, save as giving ground for the show of impatience and the mild reproof of the mother, not 231/ Andrews, Pp. 109 232/ Geikie V. I, p. 225- Joseph, when the Youth was finally found. THERE can be no doubt that Jesus had been deeply stirred by what He had seen and heard and done on this His first participation in the Temple sacrifices and ceremonies of the Passover. As we have these articles, we have, from time to time, raised the question as to how much Jesus was conscious of the past of which He was the directing power, and with what fulness did He foresee the future. The events we shall now recount leave little reasonable doubt that He remembered, in part at least, the past and foresaw at least some of the future. It can hardly be questioned that while His mortality put Him under limitations (when they were not consciously thrown off) yet that mortality and its limitations did not dominate His divinity. That Jesus deliberately planned to stay behind when the others went, can admit of little question. The record has no suggestion that His failure to go with Joseph and Mary was either a matter of chance or accident. Yet the episode given to us shows His remaining in Jerusalem was not from the wilful desire of the Youth for mere adventure. He may have wished to see the remainder of the Feast, yet remembering His divinity and its attendant knowledge this could hardly have been a controlling reason. One cannot escape the feeling that notwithstanding His attendance at the Feast, He yet had work now to do in the Temple, that He knew He 233/ Andrews, Pp. 109 MY FATHER'S BUSINESS must now begin to "be about his Father's business." He must make His beginning. We would be interested to know where He lodged during the days Joseph and Mary sought Him. If He had lodged with friends or relatives of Jerusalem and its vicinity, they could have told the searchers at once where He could be found, and there would have been no need for the long seeking; so it seems unlikely He lodged with them. It may be that, as He returned to the Temple the first day without Joseph, Jesus may have met there friends who were remaining for the entire Feast week—friends either from home or friends whom He had made during His attendance at the Feast; these may have cared for Him, for as already pointed out, everyone made a point of generous hospitality on the occasion of this great Feast. Or He may have gone at once on the first day to the doctors—He must have seen them holding their interviews with visitors during the two days He was at the Temple with Joseph. This thought certainly has some reason behind it. If He did so, the doctors, struck with His wisdom and intrigued with His intellectual powers, might have wished to probe His mind, and so have arranged to have Him lodge with some of them, Or did the priests at the Temple care for Him, as a kind of youth—waif, left or lost by his parents as they started homeward? Or did the angels care for Him as in the later days of the Temptation—"and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him." 234/ Matt. 4:11; Mark 1:13. 253 AFTER three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions." There is no indication as to where Joseph and Mary might have begun their search for Him. But we may feel sure they would first go to the place where they had lodged, and then to other relatives or friends, and then perhaps to likely quarters in the city itself. At any rate the Temple was the last place they searched. But the search for Him in the Temple itself must have been difficult. And as the record is wholly silent in the matter we may indulge our fancy as to how and where Joseph and Mary may have spent the third day seeking for Jesus in the Temple enclosure. Always there were groups of people attending the morning and evening sacrifices, and these now would be greatly enlarged by the numbers of Passover pilgrims who were remaining to finish out the full days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. So as Joseph and Mary again crossed the Royal Tyropoeon Bridge and came through the great arch into the Temple Precincts, they would again come into a seething, jostling multitude of worshipers, of animals to be sacrificed, and of money changers, dove vendors, and the like—all congregated in the Court of the Gentiles. To find a youth in this milling mass would be an almost hopeless task. So we may believe they would first walk through the stately corridors of the Royal Porch along the south wall of the Temple enclosure, on the chance 234/Matt. 4:11; Mark 1:13 254   they would find Him in the cool shades of the Porch. But they would not find Him there, so they might have gone on looking for Him in the cool shadows under the pillared porch of Solomon's Porch, along the east wall of the Temple.—It was here at a Feast of the Dedication, that, years later, Jesus parted the demand of the Jews that He tell them plainly whether He was the Christ. But Jesus would not be here, and they might well then have sought Him in the Court of the Women, the farthest point toward the Temple to which Mary might go except she were upon a sacrificial errand, or in the Court where was a simple colonnade, and galleries for the women, which might give relief from the heat of the blazing sun.—It was in this Court that years later Jesus saw the widow cast her mite into the treasury of the Temple and declared: "This poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living." As indicated above, since Mary was with Joseph when they found Jesus, and since Mary could not, on this non-sacrificial errand, go nearer the Temple than into this Court, it is clear Jesus was not in the Court of Israel, nor in the Court of the Priests holding His discussions with the doctors, and of course He was not actually in the Temple itself to which only Priests were admitted and they only for ceremonial purposes.  Not finding Jesus in the Court of the Women, Mary and Joseph would have no place to resume their search except in the Court of the Gentiles. So, it may have been that, as a last resort, they would begin to move about among the crowds in the Court of the Gentiles.—It was from this Court that Jesus twice drove the money changers, and here it probably was that He confounded the scribes and pharisees who, tempting and baiting Him, brought to Him the woman taken in adultery. Tired as Joseph and Mary were, after a long day in the heat and confusion of the Temple crowds, one can see them involuntarily moving into the less crowded areas of the Court. So they would come to the ornamental marble balustrade with its Greek and Latin inscriptions warning gentiles not to go within it toward the Temple on pain of death. Inside the balustrade were eight separate flights of fourteen steps, each nine inches high (four flights on the north side of the Temple and four on the south side), each flight leading upwards to a gate in the inner Temple wall, through which admission was gained into the Court of the Priests. These steps seemingly led to a terrace, some 15 feet broad 240 that entirely encircled the inner Temple wall, and from this terrace there was entry through the gates immediately into the Court of the Priests. This is the “Chel” of the Temple.
235/John 10:22 ff. 236/The Temple, p. 25 237/Mark 12:41 ff; Luke 21:1-4 238/John 2:13:25; Matt 21:12-16; Mark 11:15:18; Luke 19:45:48. 239/John 8:1-11. 240/The Temple, p.24 
255  It was here, so Edersheim says, that the members of the Temple-Sanhedrin came to teach on Sabbaths and Feast days. We do not know whether these teachers met at a particular place every day, or whether they met at different places on different days, or whether their place of meeting varied during each day with the position of the sun—the teachers seeking the "Chel" on the north side in the hot afternoons where the shadow of the Temple would give a welcome relief from the direct rays of the sun. It would be reasonable to assume that at least part of the time they would meet on the "Chel" just outside the "Gazith," or "Hall of Polished Stones," which was a chamber within the inner wall and just east of the land gate, counting from the west, on the south side of the Temple. This was the room in which the Sanhedrin sat.—According to some authorities it was to this chamber that Jesus was brought on the morning of the crucifixion, for the final and only legal hearing which Christ had at the hands of the Jews; but other authorities affirm that it was not held in the "Gazith." Those coming to the Temple entered at the southwest corner of the "Temple" enclosure, having passed over the Royal Tyropoeon Bridge, and through the great arch. They then went east, thence northward around the Court of the Women, and thence westward and out through the gate at the northwest corner of the Temple. So it might be that Joseph and Mary would decide as a last hope to go back to the west end of the "Chel" and going eastward follow it around to the east on the northwest. THE record says they found Jesus "after three days." It must now have been near the end of this third day. Joseph and Mary were weary, anxious, almost despairing, after hours of straining eyes and vain enquiries. They must often, in these three long days, have spoken of the thoughtlessness of the Youth. They may have censured Him, for almost irritation would have come to each of them—the patient, righteous Joseph, and Mary the Mother, as they walked and walked and watched, hour after hour, for the lost Youth. As Joseph and Mary would walk eastward, then northward, in front of the Beautiful Gate, the entrance to the Court of Women, and to the Temple proper, then westward, along the "Chel," around the outside of the inner Temple wall, they would scan carefully the crowd below them in the Court of the Gentiles for some glimpse of the missing Boy. They would go forward slowly, probably paying little attention to those who might be in front of them on the "Chel" itself. So, we can think, Joseph and Mary would pass on till they came to the shadow of the Temple falling across the terrace on the north side of the building, when, suddenly, they would come upon a quiet group, craning forward with intense interest, absorbed in their eager listening to a youthful voice, speaking in terms of authority and of deep learning and wisdom; and as they came to the group, the searchers were "amazed," for there in the midst of the doctors was Jesus whom they had sought for three long, anxious days— "amazed" at finding Him in this place, in this company, in this relationship to the learned and mighty ones of the nation. 241/The Temple, pp.30, 136. 242/Farrar, p. 470. 243/Andrews, p. 512; Edersheim II, p. 553 ff.
 Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that about my Father's business?—Luke 2:48-49. 257 MY FATHER'S BUSINESS The Sacred Record does not tell us of the subjects the doctors discussed with Jesus; it merely says: "and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers." But in the Apocryphal New Testament it is recorded that Jesus taught the "doctors and elders and learned men of Israel" concerning His Messiahship, "the books of the law, and precepts and statutes; and the mysteries which are contained in the books of the prophets; things which the mind of no creature could reach"; also concerning astronomy, physics, and natural philosophy, and metaphysics. But all this is tradition. But Joseph and Mary, coming thus suddenly upon Him, and seeing Him safe and well, had uppermost in their minds only a sense of overwhelming relief and __ gratitude, whetted by a resentment of their needless poignant anxiety and sorrow at His long absence, and so His mother, not Joseph, broke forth in such reproof as she could offer to the hitherto perfect Son: "Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing." And the Son, unabashed, unchastised, unafraid, with the calm dignity of the divinity that was His, 244/ I Infancy 21:1 ff. 257 replied to this reproof with a question—in the after years of His ministry this answering a question by a question, was to be a favorite shield against His scheming, hypocritical inquisitors. 'To Mary the Mother He said: "How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" Then says the Record: "And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them." BUT we of today, with the history of the earthly ministry of Christ before us, in Palestine, and on _ this hemisphere, with the knowledge of His pre-mortal existence, and His post-mortal resurrected place and work, we may perceive, in part at least, the truths that lay in and behind these sayings. From Mary's statement "'thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing," we may glimpse that in the intimacies of the family circle at Nazareth, Jesus gave to Joseph the love and respect of a son, and called him father. But Jesus knew that Mary knew and that Joseph knew better than this, and so came the saying "wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" Some have judged these words as if falling from the lips of a wholly mortal child, and so have found in them a rebuke from the Son to His mother. But this could not be, for the Christ Child could not be unkind. With divine knowledge and wisdom He brought in simple language to Joseph and to Mary the recollection that He was the Son of God, which, for the moment at least, seems to have Passed from their minds. 244/I Infancy 21:1 ff. BUT there was more in the saying than was known to Joseph and Mary. There was the consciousness in Jesus not alone of who He was but of His mission here on earth. He knew that centuries before God had declared to Moses: "For behold, this is my work and my glory— to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."' This was His ''Father's business/' and He "must be about it." Thus there must have been before Him the whole divine design framed in the great Council in Heaven before the world was formed. He must have remembered when the hosts, gathered together in Heaven, determined: ''We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;" —these children of God who were to take on mortality and "prove themselves" to see "if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.” And if that recollection came, another would come also— that of the rival plans offered by Himself and Lucifer, a son of the morning, and the choice of His own plan. And then would surge up in His mind the recollection of the rebellion in Heaven, the casting out of Lucifer and his followers— a third of the hosts of Heaven, and the creation of the earth by Himself— for "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made .... And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us He would remember the peopling of the earth, beginning with Adam, and Adam's Fall, and the need for an Atonement and a Redeemer of men from the mortal death of the Fall, and His own choice as this Redeemer, "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." He must have recollected the long course of God's dealings with His children, their waywardness, and proneness to evil, that they came "to be carnal, sensual and devilish.” He knew how the Father, through Himself, had sought to l)ring them to lives of righteousness, how He had through all the dispensations proclaimed the Gospel to men, how He had given them the law under which Judah and Joseph then lived— no wonder He astounded the doctors with His knowledge of the law. He knew, too, the work He was to do, He saw its problems, its hardships, its persecutions, and it must be His ultimate sacrifice. He seems to have been deeply touched by His visit to the Temple and His witnessing the rites and ceremonies typifying His own mission and destiny, by His observance of the hypocrisy and corruption of the priesthood, by His consciousness of how the people were misled to their condemnation, by His appreciation of how much there was to do and how little the time to do it— yet with all these things before Him, as it would seem 
245/ Moses 1:39. 246/ Abraham 3:24 ff. 247/ John 1:1-3, 14, 248/ Moses 7:47, 249/ Moses 5:13, MY FATHER'S BUSINESS they must have been, how careful and considerate, how dutiful He was, when to the trivial complaint (for trivial it was in view of all this) of His mother, He uttered the single sentence that proclaimed His divinity and His task—"wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" But the divinity that was in Him, told Him also, under the spur of the mother's mild rebuke, that His time had not yet come, that there was mortal preparation for Himself yet to make, that the minds of men must be further ripened, both in sympathy for truth and in hatred for Him and love for the works of Satan, that the work of John the great Forerunner must yet be done that the hearts of men might be fallowed for the real beginning of His ministry. So "he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.".Again He became the dutiful Child obeying the behests of Joseph the carpenter,' until He, Himself, was also known as the Carpenter." But while Joseph and Mary "understood not the saying which he spake unto them," yet "his mother 259 kept all these sayings in her heart." Years after, at the marriage feast in Cana, she showed she had come more to realize who He was, and His divine powers, for when they wanted wine she said unto the servants, after telling Jesus about it, "whatsoever he saith unto you, do it." So to Nazareth where the grain fields were now yellowed with ripened crops, the hills and valleys still covered with wild flowers; to Nazareth among the white rocks and cliffs splotched with green, with goats and sheep lazily grazing on the warm hillsides; to Nazareth with the houses climbing row on row up and out from the little valley floor, to the brink of the cliff from which His neighbors would one day seek to cast Him down; to Nazareth, quiet, unperturbed, with its slender cypresses and fig trees, and the evenness, frugality, and wholesomeness of a village life dominated by the presence of divinity—to this Nazareth came Joseph and Mary and Jesus who "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" against the day and hour of His destiny.
