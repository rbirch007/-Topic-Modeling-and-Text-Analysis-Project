When the Russian forces recently crossed the Pilsudski Line into Poland, they inadvertently resuscitated a boundary dispute which promises to revive the entire Polish Question. This question will be one of the most complex and crucial of all the problems on the agenda of the future World Peace Conference. The Poles have age-long feuds with the Lithuanians, the Germans, the Russians, and the Jews, involving minority problems, religious differences, complicated irredenta, economic maladjustments, and boundary disputes. Reduced to its simplest formula, the Polish Question resolves itself into the problem of survival as an independent state, or enslavement under enemy rule. The problem is complicated further from the fact that the immediate dispute involves Russia, a power that is destined to play a dominant role at the Peace Conference as one of the important, perhaps the most important, of the victorious allies. To understand this vitally important problem, it is necessary to examine in some detail the historical background of the Polish state.
The original kingdom of Poland, stretching roughly between the Oder and Vistula rivers, was founded by Boleslaw the Valiant about A.D. 1000. In the tenth century, the Poles, under German pressure, were converted to Western Christianity but their kings were able to maintain their independence in both ecclesiastical and secular affairs for about a century. Then, beginning in the twelfth century, the independence of the Poles became merely nominal, for their aggrandizing neighbors, especially the Hohenstaufen emperors, the Saxon and Bohemian kings, and in the eighteenth century, the Russian Tsarina, Catherine the Great, succeeded in forcing upon the hapless country their own nominees as puppet kings. By the thirteenth century, Poland was cut off from the Baltic by the Teutonic Knights, Pomerania and Silesia were lost to the Germanic-Roman Empire, and German settlers by controlling trade were gradually transforming western Poland into a German homeland. Against this intrusion, the Poles reacted and enjoyed a two hundred year nationalistic renaissance. The brilliant Casimir the Great (1333–1370) conquered the Red Russian Kingdom of Galicia and established an efficient system of national administration. Late in the fourteen century, Lithuania was united to Poland by personal union. AT its largest tent (1500), the Polish Kingdom Page 243 244 including Lithuania comprised the basins of the Warta, Vistula, Dvina, Dnieper, and upper Dniester rivers. Although a large state geographically, a variety of circumstances contributed to make Poland weak and unstable. In the first place, the kingdom was without natural boundaries or adequate means of defense. To the west, it was separated from Prussia and Austria by an artificial line drawn through level plains and over low hills. To the south, the Dniester, in the main, set it off from Turkey. To the east and the north, the boundary ran through the fertile valleys of the Dnieper and the Dvina. No chain of mountains and no strongly fortified places protected the Poles from the Germans, Turks or Russians. The population of Poland was markedly heterogeneous, a factor which mitigated against the creation of a vigorous nationalism. The Poles themselves centering in the western cities of Warsaw and Cracow, constituted a majority of the population, but the Lithuanians, a kindred Slavic folk, covered the east central part of the kingdom. While a large number of Cossacks and Ruthenians or Little Russians lived in the extreme east, Swedes and Germans lived along the northern and western borders. Then there was a considerable number of Jews domiciled within the kingdom during the nineteenth century in what became known as the "Jewish Pale." Religion added its share to the dissensions created by race and language within Poland. The Poles and most of the Lithuanians are staunch Roman Catholics. The Russians and some of the Lithuanians are adherents of the Greek Orthodox Faith, while the Germans and Swedes are Lutherans. The minority Protestants and Greek Orthodox Russians, thanks to the political strength of their homelands, were able to exact from the Poles a toleration and freedom of worship which at that time existed in no other country of Europe. The decline of the Polish nation, however, is attributable mainly to its hopeless internal dissensions. These have been the result of a decadent social structure and a hopelessly ineffective political organization. In mediaeval Poland, about two-thirds of the Polish people were serfs—ignorant, squalid, politically indifferent, and apathetic. Incapable of possessing property, they were also devoid of political rights. The higher nobility, never numbering more than two hundred and always contesting the authority of the crown, were the real power within the state. The middle class of nobles consisted of about twenty-five thousand persons. 'The lower nobility, numbering more than one million, were an idle, ignorant class of people "who were shut out by their pride of birth from the thrift and comfort which they might have acquired by industry while the most insignificant of them could nullify the proceedings of the Polish Diet by his single veto." The remainder of the citizen population consisted of artisans, clergymen, and Jews. These numbered about 50,000 before 1800. They lived in wretched villages and were almost as completely subject to the oppression of the nobles as were the serfs themselves. Only Jews, artisans, and clergy were taxed. Describing Polish society in the THE POLISH QUESTION eighteenth century, Professor Hayes says: significance, leaving the country without d jealously played politics, while the mass of the nation were state of serfdom and d be difficult to Europe. With a other, social solidarity, of political independence, was entirely lacking. PERHAPS of all contemporary governments of Europe, that of the Poles was the most inefficient. Since the sixteenth century the monarchy had been elective, with the result that the electors chosen from among the higher nobility were able to wring out of their sovereigns pernicious bribes and unholy promises to such a degree as to make the kingship an ornamental figurehead. Most of the elected kings were foreigners, chiefly German princes from Bohemia and Saxony, who used their power in furtherance of their own native interests rather than that of the welfare of Poland. Another absurdity of the Polish constitution was the celebrated liberum veto, a kind of gentleman's agreement among, the magistrates, whereby no law whatsoever could be enacted by the Diet if a single member felt it was prejudicial to his interests, and objected. This principle had been extended so far that by the eighteenth century it was recognized that anyone of Poland's twenty-five thousand noblemen had lawful right to refuse to obey any law which he disapproved. Obviously 245 this condition led t political anarchism. The election of Stanislas Poniatowski, nominee of the Russian Tsarina, to the kingship in 1764, spelled disaster to the Poles and led immediately to the infamous partitions of 1772, 1793, and 1795. The King was unable to restrain the civil war which resulted from the opposition of the noble factions toward his election and the unrest caused by the parallel Russo-Turkish War. Taking advantage of this chaotic situation, Frederick the Great of Prussia proposed to his ally Catherine the Great the nefarious scheme To maintain the balance of power, Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria, joined the unholy pact. By the first partition of Poland (1772), Russia absorbed Polish Livonia and the territories between the upper waters of the Dvina and the Dnieper; Germany obtained Polish Prussia, except Danzig and Thorn; while Austria secured Galicia, celebrated for its rich mines. Though Russia received the smallest and least populous portion of the stolen territory, the value of her share was enhanced by the industry and wealth of its inhabitants, while it also connected Prussia proper with Brandenburg. The Poles, stunned by their tragic misfortune, attempted time an again to resuscitate "themselves by enacting radical, political reforms, but the shameful and hypocritical attitude of their enemy neighbors, foiled every effort. Taking advantage the French revolutionary were engulfing all Europe, Russia and Prussia, in 1793: executed the second partition of Poland; and two years later, 1795 with 246 Austria invited to share the spoils, completed the dismemberment of the once formidable but now decadent and unhappy state. In vain did the brilliant Kosciusko try to stem the tide of foreign invasion and spoliation, "Freedom shrieked when Kosciusko fell." By the second and third partitions, Austria acquired the upper valley of the Vistula with the important city of Cracow; Prussia took the lower valley of the Vistula with Warsaw; and Russia seized the remainder of the ill-fated kingdom, the major share, including Ruthenia and practically all of Lithuania. Thus the once powerful Poland ceased to exist as an independent power. It was entirely blotted out of the list of independent nations— a victim to its own weakness and its internal dissensions, as well as, in the rapacity of its enemy neighbors, to one of the most audacious and disgraceful outrages in all history. DESPITE the loss of independence, Polish nationalism was not extinguished. On the contrary it increased in intensity and expressed itself belligerently in the unhappy revolutions of 1831 and 1863 directed against the Russian autocrats. The Poles fought gallantly, but their defense was paralyzed, as usual, by the entire lack of national means of fortification and by bitter internal feuds. Then, too, they were overwhelmed by superior numbers and, moreover, were bereft of foreign help. Both Prussia and Austria, with portions of Poland of their own, were hostile to any independent Poland, while France and England hesitated to interfere lest their actions might upset the European equilibrium and precipitate a general war. As a result of the first revolution (1831), Czar Nicholas I abrogated the constitution of 1815 and incorporated the Polish Kingdom as a conquered province of the Russian Empire; as a result of the second (1863), Czar Alexander II subjected the unhappy Poles to increased persecution and unwarranted tyranny. Vigorous steps were taken to extinguish Polish nationalism. For example, the use of the Polish language was made illegal, and all teachers were compelled to use Russian—even when they were giving instructions in Polish literature and language. Public offices in Poland were closed to Poles, and, from 1885 to 1897, no Pole was permitted to sell land to a non-Russian. The Russian government deprived the Polish Catholic Church of much of its revenue and converted parish priests into salaried state officials. Moreover, many monasteries were suppressed and their property confiscated by the state. Worse still was the lot of the unfortunate Jews residing within Poland. In 1882, Czar Alexander II forbade the Jews to acquire land or enter into the liquor trade. The numbers eligible for secondary schools and universities were limited to three per cent of the total student bodies. In 1890, all Jews in Russia were forced to reside in designated towns in the so-called Jewish Pale, circumscribed within the limits of Esthonia, Ukraine, and Poland. Finally, the government refused to interfere in the many spontaneous pogroms directed against them by prejudiced Russians. In fact, it has been proved that governmental officials were accessories in THE POLISH QUESTION many of these cruel outbreaks, notably the massacre of Kishinev in 1903. So great, in fact, was the persecution against these people that despite the efforts of the government to keep them within their respective pales, some 300,000 Jews left Russia within a. Single year (1891). It is not Surprising that many patriotic Poles thought they discerned in the World War (1914- 1918) the long-sought-for Opportunity to set up a Polish national state. And thanks to the friendship of the Allies and the brilliant efforts of Polish leaders, Joseph Pilsudski and Ignace Jan Paderewski, this cherished dream came true. On November 16, 1918, Joseph Pilsudski, who had six days Previously taken Command of the Polish armies, announced to the world the existence of a new, independent Polish republic. The newly created state was recognized by the Treaty of Versailles, June 28, 1919, and by the Treaty of Riga, March 21, 1921. Pilsudski became chief of state and Paderewski, Premier and minister of foreign affairs. Filled with expansionist ambitions and the desire for natural frontiers, Pilsudski sought to incorporate within the new state, Lithuania, the Ukraine, Galicia, part of the new Czechoslovakia, and as much more of Germany and Russia as he dared claim on ethnological, historical or sentimental grounds. As a result of this program, Poland fought three wars with Lithuania, the Ukraine, and Russia; disregarded the admonitions of the Allied Supreme Council which had advised against expansion; and ended by accepting (Treaty of Riga, 1921) the frontiers which gave her 247 approximately 150,000 Square miles rather than the 282,000 Square miles which she had coveted. Of her final frontiers, in the words of one Polish statesman, 75 per cent Were permanently menaced, 20 per cent were insecure, and only 5 per cent really safe," Poland adopted a liberal constitution, in 1921, based upon the French model. It provided for an elective upper house called the Senate, and a lower house called the Sejm. Universal suffrage was established. But the first few years under the new regime were chaotic. Conservatives and radicals in Parliament were deadlocked, land reform lagged, the financial situation became critical, and widespread corruption prevailed, Matters became so bad that Pilsudski, already estranged from the president, Stanislaus Wajcieshowski, in May 1926, rallied 
three regiments about him, marched and established a dictatorship. Assuming the portfolio of minister of war, Pilsudski dictated Polish policies and established a new constitution. This new document changed the mode of election and strengthened considerably the powers of the executive. Hereafter, the president was to be chosen by popular vote, rather than by the National Assembly, from two candidates, the one selected by the retiring Sejm and the other by the retiring president, he new constitution gave the president full power to appoint and dismiss ministers, the head of the supreme court, and the commander-in-chief of the army; to decide on war and peace; to negotiate and ratify treaties; to dissolve the parliament at will; and to appoint one-third of the Senate of ninety-six 248 members. Refusing to accept the position of president, Pilsudski, as dictator, chose rather to control the government and its foreign policies behind the scenes as minister of war. The dictator died May 12, 1935, and was succeeded by his appointee, Inspector General RydzSmigly. General Sladowski, RydzSmigly's appointee, became premier in 1936, and held that portfolio until the German invasion, September 1939. —_" After the German invasion of Poland, the government officials left the country. President Ignace Mosicki from his refuge in Rumania announced his resignation, September 30, 1939, and was succeeded by Wladislaw Raczkiewiez, who immediately established Paris as the seat of government. Later, after the fall of France, he established his headquarters at London. OF all problems affecting the future of Poland, the most crucial is that of national boundaries. In order to guarantee the Poles an adequate Baltic seaport, the Paris Peace Conference, in 1919, converted the German port of Danzig into a Free City, to be under the economic domination of Poland, but politically under the general supervision of the League of Nations. Poland was made responsible for the foreign relations of the city and the supervision of its commercial customs. It was stipulated further that the port was never to be used as a military or naval base without the previous consent of the League. Needless to say, the above arrangement resulted only in the most strained relations between the Danziger Germans and the Poles. During the first five years of the existence of the Free City, the League Commissioner handed down about fifty decisions and as many more have been appealed to the Council of the League and even to the World Court. The difficulty of drawing a line between economic and political matters, the traditional hatred between the two peoples, and the fear among the Danzigers that the Poles were contemplating direct annexation of the city, all tended to render the situation one of great danger. Another point of friction has been the aroused jealousy of the Danzigers because of the building of the Polish port at Gdynia in the Corridor. From a mere fishing village, the Poles have built a seaport of 125,000 inhabitants with a harbor that can accommodate fifty steamships. Naturally, the inhabitants of Danzig are worried over an enterprise which promises to deflect their chief business, shipping, to a neighboring city. The creation of the "Polish Corridor," a stretch of territory 260 miles long and eighty miles wide, formerly comprising the German provinces of West Prussia and Posen and containing the extremely important Vistula Valley, has caused no end of resentment from the dispossessed Germans. East Prussia today is virtually an island of German colonists, surrounded completely by Polish territory and separated from Pomerania by the Corridor. The transfer of this territory was justified by the Allies on the ground that the interests which Germans in East Prussia, who number less than 2,000,000, have in establishing a land connection with THE POLISH QUESTION Germany, are less vital than the interests of the whole Polish nation in securing direct access to the sea, Through the creation of the Corridor, Poland became a complete economic unit. Germany, on the other hand, was weakened both economically and militarily in the Baltic area. Found themselves deprived of a free market in the Corridor for their cattle, grain, timber, and horses. By agreement, in April 1921, Germany of transit for Passengers and freight across the Corridor to and from East Prussia, but this arrangement has not been satisfactory for Germans who have desired to cross the area without passports and without the bother of submitting their Possessions for customs inspection at both the East Prussian and Pomeranian frontiers, and have had to travel in "sealed" cars, a fact which has added materially to t he discomfiture of travel. The Germans, too, have complained of the treatment accorded their minority group of perhaps 100,000 residing within the Corridor. The question of the disposition of Vilna, ancient capital of Lithuania, has caused no end of ill-feeling between the Poles and the Lithuanians. The partitions of Poland in the late eighteenth century brought Vilna under Russian control, but after the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917, the Lithuanians declared their independence and attempted to make Vilna their capital. Fighting ensued, and in January 1919, the Bolsheviks captured the city, only to be dislodged in turn by a Polish army. Despite the fact that the Supreme Allied Council assigned Vilna to Lithuania on December 8, 1919, and that Russia recognized this cession, July 12, 1920, the Poles refused to accept the mandate and continued their war with Russia, Finally, the Council of the League of Nations on February 23, 1923, recognized the Polish conquest and assigned Vilna to Poland. In the following month, the Conference of Ambassadors recognized this boundary as permanent. The Lithuanians, however, refused to accept the award. The problem was solved finally, in 1938, when, as a result of the killing of a Polish soldier across the Lithuanian bor. Der, the Poles presented the Lithuanians with a twenty-four hour ultimatum, demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations and the abandonment by Lithuania of all her Claims to Vilna. Polish troops were. Forthwith massed on the border. With this turn of events the Lithuanian government accepted the Polish demands in full. Border Complications arose with Russia after the conclusion of the great World War (1914-1918). In 1919, the Paris Peace Conference recommended the so-called Curzon Line as Poland's eastern boundary. This line Tunning directly south from the Lithuanian border through Brest-Litovsk, was drawn roughly on the ethnologic line separating the territory of ancient Poland, inhabited almost exclusively by Russians, from that to the west occupied predominately by Poles. It was far short, however, of the limits of eighteenth-century Poland. The Russians, at the time, were in no mood to accept the frontier and began a war, in 1920, to recover the Polish terri- (Continued on page 288) "
