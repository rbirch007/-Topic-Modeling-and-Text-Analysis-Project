THE FIRST BORN Abbie R. Madsen You are the song of my heart, You are the bud and the rose; The murmuring peace of the singing brook, The perfumed breeze as it blows. You are the twilight and dawn, You are the ultimate goal; The strength and the courage to live and dare, The unending song in my soul.
