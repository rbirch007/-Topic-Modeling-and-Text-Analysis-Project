Glimpses of an Old Town Katherine Palmer Macfarlane The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
They then all repeated this short prayer:
Blessed art Thou, Jehovah our God, King of the Universe, who hath redeemed us and redeemed our fathers from Egypt.
The Second Cup of Wine
The second cup of wine was now drunk.
The Second Washing of the Hands
Then with the same blessing offered before the first washing of hands, the hands were washed for the second time.
The Eating of the Meal
This ceremony finished, the eating of the real meal began.
One of the two unleavened cakes was then taken by the one presiding and broken, he using both hands, as he pronounced the blessing:
Blessed be Thou, O Lord our God, the King of the Universe, who bringest forth food out of the earth.
A piece of this bread was then handed to each of those who surrounded the table by the one presiding, saying:
This is the bread of affliction which our fathers did eat in the land of Egypt.
All then ate unleavened bread each one so wishing, dipping the bread in the "charoseth."
It is believed that it was at this point in the Last Supper that Jesus identified his betrayer by handing him a bit of unleavened bread dipped in the "charoseth"?the sop.
The one presiding then blessed God and then ate of the "Chaggah" (when brought); he again blessed God, and then ate of the lamb.
The company then began eating, leisurely, at the same time discoursing on religious subjects, until they were satisfied. When they had finished, they ate another piece of the Paschal lamb, even if no more than "the size of an olive," for the taste of this was to remain in their mouths.
The Third Cup of Wine
After this, the third cup of wine was filled and blessed in the usual manner, and then drunk, each one of the company repeating after the one presiding, the words which he uttered. This is considered to be the "cup of blessing."
Some scholars affirm that it was at this point in the feast that the Savior, using the ceremony over the third cup, introduced the wine of the sacrament at the Last Supper.
While scholars seem not in accord on the details of the concluding ceremonies after the third cup was drunk, Lees gives them as follows:
Following the drinking of the third cup, a blessing was pronounced,

THEY came mostly from England and Scotland and Wales, in answer to a call from Church authority for converts who knew the business of making iron, who could undertake a task that might bring to realization the dream of Brigham Young of founding a great industry within the boundaries of Deseret.
After weary months of travel by slow ship and ox team, they reached a land far south of Salt Lake City, and looked about with mixed feelings at the setting of their future homes. They rejoiced to come to rest at last in Zion; to know, too, that out beyond the gap in the western hills were the mountains of solid iron that had drawn them from afar.
But what a country! Around them lay tumbled mountain ranges and empty, sage-gray, hill-broken valleys?a vast panorama of strange shapes, and shifting desert colors?a land so silent and primeval that the only sounds were the sighing of the wind in the cedars and cottonwoods among which they were encamped, and the lonely howl of coyotes in the night.
The newcomers were joined by other companies, and while some of the colony planted crops and built a fort, others laid out the site of the ironworks on the creek bank where to the northeast corner of Cedar City now stands.
Then began a story which though now little known, was an epic of pioneer toil and initiative and courage. The first task was to build a road up a wild, precipitous canyon to the coal that would be needed for running furnaces; another to the beds of iron ore miles away. After that, the ore had to be hauled laboriously by ox team and broken up by hand for the furnace. The coal proving unsuitable for making coke, it had to be supplemented by mountainous supplies of wood, brought in at great cost of labor and equipment. Every man who ventured any distance from the fort, stood in danger of attack from Indians.
After months of labor, the homemade furnace was finished. Then the laborers asked each other, "Will it work?" The evening the crucial test was to be made was an anxious one for the colony, and every man, woman, and child traveled the two miles from the fort to the furnace to watch. The hours passed and they drew closer together, their eyes fixed on the furnace and their faces strained with the conflict of mingled hope and fear. Then just at daylight, the miracle?a stream of molten iron burst from the furnace!
The watchers clasped each other with joy. In a religious ecstasy they shouted, "Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, to God and the Lamb!" And when they turned back to the fort it was with hearts filled with thanksgiving, for now they could stay to build a fine community and, more important, bring to realization the dream of their beloved leader.
But they had reckoned without the wilderness. Early years as soon as winter came, the creek that was GLIMPSES OF AN OLD TOWN their only source of water power froze over; roads and canyons became blocked with snow. Afterwards, drouths came to reduce the creek to an impotent stream, and twice, following cloudbursts in the mountains, torrential floods swept down the canyon, destroying roads, carrying away equipment and the furnace; a Herculean effort that carried it had taken months to accumulate, and burying the site of the works under tons of rock and debris.
But the little group would not give up. In them was the same blood and the same intrepid spirit that twenty-five years later was to take a company from Southern Utah down the dizzy, defile of "Hole-in-the-Rock" and on over perilous ways to settle San Juan County. When there were not enough tools, the men stripped tires from wagon wheels to make more, and when there was neither tar nor axle grease, the women gathered their scanty stores of fat, and even the precious bits of butter from their tables, and gave them to be used for greasing the machinery.
The enterprise grew until several coke ovens were running, and iron, in increasing quantities, was manufactured. Many parts of machinery were made, and such objects as grates, horseshoes, nails, flatirons, and andirons. A bell was cast that rang the people of Cedar City to church for many years, and now reposes, the most interesting and possibly the only known object to survive that pioneer industry, in the public library of Cedar City.
As the business grew over the years, the handcart increased in proportion. At last, the little colony could no longer cope with them.
The same years had been bringing iron into the Territory so that the need for the local manufacture of it was less vital. In 1857, the ironworks in Cedar City were closed down.
It was disheartening to the people who had put so much toil and sacrifice into it, to see the enterprise come to an end. But they had made a valiant effort, and in spite of failure, had written one of the most unique and heroic chapters in the history of Utah.
TO add to their other trials and worries, the first settlers of Cedar City early began to suffer from want of food. After the supplies they had brought with them were gone, they had to rely for food on their fields, and, during successive years, drouth and crickets came to destroy the crops. In 1855, only twenty bushels of wheat were raised in the whole of Iron County. The following spring, the people went into the hills and dug sego roots to eke out their scanty fare.
Before me, I have a copy of a journal kept by John Urie, an early settler, in which he says of that period of want:
My experience in this place for the following 8 years (from 1853) was extraordinary hard, often without food for three and four days at a time, at one time four months without bread of any kind, living on roots and weeds of different kinds. This was in consequence of grasshoppers, bad harvests, etc.
It can truly be said that for a number of years, until orchards could be grown and flocks and herds increased enough to provide meat, hunger in varying degrees was the constant 158 companion of the pioneers of Cedar City and Iron County. Yet it is Surprising to discover, from the records of that day, that during those years of privation, a lively community life was going on in Cedar City. There were Church activities, school, dances, theatricals, and many social gatherings. A choir and a band were organized. A number of local industries were established.: In one of the hardest years, there was formed an organization called "The Mechanic's Institute." This group not only studied the science of mechanics, but it succeeded in manufacturing gas with which the on?-roomed meeting house was lighted for one winter, (In all likelihood, this was the first gas manufactured west of the Mississippi.  How was it that such a com. Munity life could flourish under the disintegrating effects of hunger, poverty, isolation, and the inconveniences imposed by that hard country? The answer lay both in the character of the people and in a religious faith that bound them into a brotherhood, gave purpose to their efforts, and lifted them in spirit above much that was harsh in their lives. Without such a faith, that community life would surely have fallen apart. THE experience of my Own parents in making a home in early Cedar City is worth relating here, for the same spirit and effort with which they adapted to a new life was experienced by many of their neighbors. When mother came from Wales, she was a bride of twenty-one, a doll like bit of a person who looked little equal to the rigors of pioneer life. But mother, like father, possessed a stout heart and an unshakable faith, and she took to pioneering like a duck to water. By the time she had had her first two children, she could run a mold of tallow candles, make lye from cottonwood ashes, cure meat, and cut out a man's suit from a length of home. Spun. She had become the mistress of a dozen. Crafts and could do well the many tasks that a Pioneer household exacted. Father and mother lived for the first year of their married life in the old log cabin that now stands in the public park in Cedar City, an interesting relic of pioneer days. But their own house was being built, and it was a proud day when they walked down the steps of their dugout and took possession. They worked very hard to make the dugout habitable, and after awhile it was habitable in a simple pioneer way. No Passing stranger could have guessed what cleanliness and coziness and cheer were there. Beneath that dirt roof were plastered and whitewashed walls and clean-scrubbed floors; in two comers of the one big room were beds covered with pretty patchwork quilts; the fireplace was at the other end, with andirons of father's own making, and a hearth that was "white stoned" every day with gypsum brought from the hills. On the mantel were pieces of pewter and brass that had come from the old country and were kept brightly polished by much rubbing; the long, narrow windows had white valances. Beyond the latched door was a porch with a pantry on one side and on the other, a little, old-fashioned stove that cooked many a pot of soup and many a Welsh GLIMPSES OF AN OLD TOWN griddle cake for the guests who came in ever-increasing numbers to eat at father's and mother's hospitable board. By the time I came along, the dugout was used as an apple cellar and catch-all for family junk. We children cared nothing when it was pulled down and the ground leveled. But father and mother cared, and they always declared that the happiest years of their lives were those spent in the dugout. This story of a home sounds, and really was, in father's and mother's case, rather idyllic. But the life of | those pioneers was hard in many ways. The women particularly must have found it hard. The pioneer wife and mother had to bear her children in the midst of family cares. Her house, even though simple, was inconvenient and hard to keep clean, and there were no labor-saving devices. No matter how weary she might be, she could not send out to buy a loaf of bread nor a can of meat or vegetables, but every bite the family ate had to be prepared by her hands. Nearly all the clothes the family wore she had to make, as well as her rugs, quilts, and carpets. The pioneer woman had to be both capable and hard working to maintain a decent family life. Yet among the older women in Cedar City?the pioneer stock?I remember very many who were skillful housekeepers, whose homes were homes of cleanliness and order. Besides doing their own work, those women often helped to care for the sick and the needy of the community, and saw to it that their own families took part in church and public life. By their efficiency they helped 159 greatly to keep up community standards. THE settlers of pioneer Cedar City had to live in a backwoods way for the first years, but they themselves were not backwoods people. Some were gathered from the poor and the lowly, but more came from the comfortable middle classes of Great Britain and America, and had had all the advantages of those classes. The first school teacher in Cedar City was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh.. There were not many who possessed such scholarship, it is true, but most of the people had had the common school education of their day, and scarcely one was entirely illiterate. It was natural that those immigrants, coming to their new homes from the old across the seas, should bring with them bits of family treasure, and as good clothes as they had or could afford to buy. And so it happened that many a chest brought into our pioneer settlement by ox team held broadcloth suits and dresses of silk and other good materials; Paisley shawls and satin bonnets; lengths of linen; embroidery and gold ornaments; books and pieces of china. My grandfather brought with him two velvet hunting suits with knee-breeches, and long hose and buckled shoes. In that wilderness of sagebrush and jackrabbits, there was no such thing as riding to hounds, and the velvet suits were put to more practical use when they were cut up to make clothes for the children. In an old wooden box in mother's upstairs, there used to be a white horsehair bonnet, very fine and dainty, with a wreath of tiny white flowers around the crown, that had been part of mother's wedding trousseau when she came to Cedar City as father's bride. There was also a wine-colored merino dress with white linen collar and cuffs, and a pair of kid shoes. I have often thought that it must have been a surprising sight, and a rather charming one, to see father and mother climb the steps of their ancestral dugout and set off to church, she in her wedding clothes and he in his best dark suit over which he wore a blue army cape bought from a soldier passing through the settlement on his way to California.
An old invoice of 1855 for the first bill of goods sent for from Cedar City still exists, and is an illuminating commentary on the standards of the pioneers of my old town. There is no room in this article for a copy of it, but it contains such items as Tuscan bonnets, bonnet silk, Irish linen, kid shoes, veiling, silk velvet; such items as grammar, dictionaries, and books on chemistry and philosophy.
As time went on, the good clothes wore out (the shoes going first). Then it became a common sight to see a man at the door of the dance hall dressed in buckskin moccasins; the one after him in a high silk hat and broadcloth suit, but barefoot; lace and ruffles dancing in the same set with linsey that had been spun and dyed by the lady who wore it. But however motley their clothes, the ballroom manners of that older generation were decorous and even formal. They would have been shocked at most of the dancing of today.

GLIMPSES OF AN OLD TOWN In appraising the culture of pioneer Cedar City, we must remember that our early pioneer towns were not an outgrowth of the Western frontier, but they represented a culture that was gathered out of old centers of civilization and set down bodily in the heart of the wilderness. Those luxuries that cost money, my old town could not buy. It was years before it owned a bit of statuary or a painting worthy of the name. But one branch of art it could afford and in that it excelled ?that was choral singing. The first choir in Cedar City was led by John Macfarlane, the composer of the beautiful Christmas carol, "Far, Far Away on Judea's Plains." Several of those early families had good singing voices, and in their native lands had heard the prominent singers of their day and good choruses. They needed only leadership. After John Macfarlane was called to St. George, there came to Cedar City a young Welshman, who in his boyhood had sung in Eisteddfodds in Wales, and who came of a family of choristers. Joseph Cosslett's soul was afire with music, and he was never so happy as when training his choir. And so it came that in that country town, in the heart of a remote frontier and hundreds of miles from musical centers, fine renditions of Handel and Haydn were heard, and a high tradition established that holds to this day. I think that in pioneer times there drifted around our town and other towns of Southern Utah, many a cowboy song and song of the outdoors composed by local talent, that was never preserved. We didn't thing much then of that kind of music. Its place, we felt, was out on 161 the range with the activities of range life. Our attitude toward cowboy music was similar to our attitude toward Indian handicraft. Navajo rugs were used for saddle blankets and camp outfits?no one would have thought of putting one down on a floor. (I remember a huge roll of Navajo rugs belonging to a brother that stood for a period on our back porch without arousing anyone's wish to see its contents. Mother said it should be in a barn because it smelled "Indian".) The pioneer period of the life of Cedar City lasted from the time of its founding in 1851 until?well, the coming of the automobile. During that time a second generation grew up and a third was in its childhood. The town grew and there were improvements. But pioneer ways and habits of thought still prevailed. Houses of adobe and brick took the place of the log cabins and dugouts of an earlier day. The local carpenters and masons who planned and built them knew little of architectural rules, but because they used simple lines and honest material, sometimes they built well. One of my townsmen who lives in an old-fashioned house told me of a visit he had from a stranger, who photographed the house from many angles, talking enthusiastically all the while about its perfect proportions and the charm of its brick trim and small-paned windows. The stranger was the editor of a prominent architectural magazine, and he declared that many old pioneer houses in Utah not only possessed a distinction that newer houses lacked, but proved the early Mormon pioneers to have been people of refinement and good taste. 162 One day I was standing on a corner of Main Street in Cedar City with Professor Frank Arnold of the State Agricultural College, a New Englander who had lived abroad. He stood gazing raptly at the old Tabernacle that used to stand on Main Street. "Just look at those lines," he cried in his rapid, clipped speech, "those lovely windows! It is like the old churches in Southern France. The little jew-ell! The little jew-ell! How did these people come to build it?" THE people of that old pioneer town made no fanfare about helping with community work. It was done simply and as a matter of course. When a road needed repairs, the bishop got up in Sunday meeting and said, "Brethren, the road to the west field has been very muddy since the spring storms. Can't we all get together Thursday morning with our teams and haul some gravel?" And on Thursday morning the men and teams were there and the gravel was hauled. No banquets nor newspaper editorials to work up public spirit. No Praise giv- "en, and none expected. Much credit is due to our commercial and service clubs for the good they accomplish in our towns. But as yet, they have found no method of getting public work done which or simplicity and effectiveness can equal that old pioneer method that got under way when the bishop arose in church and said, "Brethren, the toad to the west field is very muddy. Let us get together and haul some gravel." There was not much money in our old town, and no well-to-do donors to support community projects. But when the people wanted a public building, somehow it got built. It was a dollar here and a dollar there, a few days of labor donated by one man, a few bushels of wheat by another, eggs and hams and honey and butter from families that could not give money, and in that way churches and schoolhouses were built and many public projects put over, It was that simple but practical method that partly built the well known Escalante Hotel and did entirely put up the central college building of the Branch Agricultural College. The public schools of Pioneer Cedar City were the schools of their day, which means that they were not very good. The courses of instruction were elemental, attendance irregular, the teachers untrained and only occasionally were they really capable. The music and art instruction, the libraries and workshops and gymnasiums that so enrich the lives of today's children, were undreamed of. I was born into a later Pioneer period, yet I grew up to my twenties entirely innocent of any critical knowledge of the pictorial and the plastic arts. Yet I think that no child could live in that setting of sky and mountain and valley, over which from morning until night and through every season played a thousand prismatic hues, and not grow up saturated in color. No child could gaze through that crystal air at the great landscape beyond the town and not sense the grandeur of space. No child could play among the orchards in which my old town was embowered, seeing the loveliness of apple and peach and plum blossoms. In the GLIMPSES OF AN OLD TOWN OLD TABERNACLE, CEDAR CITY, UTAH, 1901. Spring, and not have some knowledge of beauty. Because of its isolation, few visitors came to our town in pioneer days. Those who did were mostly the cattle buyer on his yearly round, an occasional traveling man, residents from the nearby settlements, state or Church officials making brief visits. But when silver was discovered in the sands of Dixie, and the mining town of Silver Reef sprang up, many strangers were knocking at our gates. For a number of years a colorful procession traveled through the town, a procession of miners, prospectors, Chinese coolies, gamblers, and rich mine owners, all pressing eagerly forward to make their fortunes in the Eldorado of Southern Utah. When the mines began to close down, many a man came 163 straggling back, empty of pocket and glad to accept a meal and a bed from the quiet old Mormon town he had had scarcely a glance for when he was going the other way. My older brothers and sisters have told me about the days when the coach that carried the mail and the bullion from Silver Reef to Salt Lake City rolled through our Main Street with two spans of horses, and, on the high seat beside the driver, a guard in the person of a huge, black-bearded Frenchman wearing a sombrero and carrying guns in the tops of his high boots. The coach stopped at the post office for mail, and if there were no passengers, often a bevy of little girls like a flock of twittering birds, burst through the gate in front of the post office and surrounded the driver. "Oh, please give us a ride!" they 164 would coax, "Just a little way?just to the Big Bridge!" Perhaps the rough men were touched by the appeal of innocent childhood, for often the door was opened and the little girls (my sister one of them) were allowed to climb inside, Then, to the accompaniment of shouts from the driver and a chorus of excited squeals, the coach leaped forward and rolled away up the street. Too soon the bridge was reached and the ride ended. But it was a moment of pure romance to remember long after the children were grown, and the coach-and-four, with its armed guard and its boot holding silver bullion, had gone the way of many another feature of an old and colorful West. S I said in the beginning, the pioneers of Cedar City came mostly from Great Britain. They were intensely loyal to the land of their adoption; but the older ones kept their native speech and manners and even old-fashioned styles of dress, and these added something quaint and charming to our pioneer town. Children who had never been out of Cedar City heard from their parents and grandparents many a strange bit of folklore and description of faraway scenes. Father used to tell me sometimes the story of the battle of Waterloo as he had heard it from his old Uncle Moses who fought there. One of the happy recollections of my childhood is of going to grandmother's house in the evenings before Christmas to hear her tell, in her soft Welsh voice, how a certain yew tree near her old home was said to burst into bloom at midnight of Christmas Eve and the cattle in the farm to kneel at that sacred hour. We learned old English games and heard such songs as "The Mistletoe Bough," "Jock O'Hazeldean," "March of the Men of Harlech." For years the town observed May Day, and on that day, as was the case in many an English village of two hundred years ago, the May queen was crowned and the Maypole braided by couples in bright costumes. Afterwards if the weather permitted, there was a town picnic in the canyon, when old games were played (no one conscious of their origin), and the "Anticks and Comicals" dressed as clowns frolicked among the crowd. The Cedar City of pioneer days was Western in its occupations. It looked Western for the most part. On Main Street on any week day were cattlemen and freighters, horseback riders, Indians dressed in buckskin and wearing their hair in long braids. Sometimes in the late fall, the men who had ridden the range all summer brought in wild horses and held bucking exhibitions on Main Street that would have stolen the show in any rodeo. But there on Main Street was something not of the West. There, in the speech and appearance of some of the older generation, were Glasgow and Liverpool, Kent and Glamorgan and Yorkshire, a sprinkling of Scandinavia, and even a glimpse of the East Indies. It was the mellow hues of the Old World woven with the bold colors of the New, to make a unique and rich background for a child to grow up against. When I was a girl I used to long to get away from Cedar City, to go GLIMPSES OF AN OLD TOWN where there was "culture," see interesting sights and the kind of people I read about in books. Now I know that a most fascinating world was there, and, right under my nose, the stuff of which literature is made.
The old pioneers of Cedar City are gone now. I remember how sincere they were, how staunch and full of fortitude; and when I think of them one by one, some so picturesque and all with such strong individualities, I feel a sharp pang of regret, knowing that in this standardized world, I shall not see their like again.
Author's Note: I am indebted to William R. Palmer for much information on early Cedar City. Also for the photographs.
