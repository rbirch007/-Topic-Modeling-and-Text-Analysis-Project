How I Help Ward Literature Leaders in Lieu of Union Meetings Fae J. Nielsen Member of Pocatello Stake Board THE discontinuance of union meetings has had a tendency toward promoting close harmony between our stake and ward literature leaders. We have learned to pool our good ideas as well as our problems, and thereby help each other. We have each become more self-reliant and more cooperative. Since the reading of the Bible has been urged in the auxiliary organizations of the Church, many people are discovering their interest in it. The modern translations of the Bible by Ernest S. Bates and Doctor Richard G. Moulton present this "priceless storehouse of excellent writing" arranged in forms conducive to leisure-time reading as well as study for spiritual guidance. I sincerely believe that a beautiful and lasting appreciation for Bible literature is being cultivated through the Relief Society. Most of us require a little persuasion to do the things which are best for us. The Government has carried out an extensive program to educate the public concerning the present need for good nutrition. Our literature classes are a medium through which the Relief Society is giving us spiritual and literary nourishment. Both programs have been planned to meet a very urgent present-day need for physical and spiritual fortitude. The ways in which I help ward literature leaders vary from month to month. However, there are some helps which may be used consistently by every stake class leader. Certainly, any system which results in thorough preparation is to be recommended. Classifications for Planning First, it is necessary to plan ahead; it is advisable to have lessons in mind two or three months in advance. Second, it is important to build an atmosphere which will lend added significance to the lesson to be presented. This may be done through coordination with the music department, use of short stories, selected poems, and visual aids, such as pictures and maps. Word pictures by people who have traveled or read a great deal, add a touch of reality. Third, know your sources of information; read your Bible. Use Thelessons, making repeated references to back lessons, 1. E., those for 1942-1943. They reveal new meanings with each reading. Repetition is one of the most dependable methods of teaching. To avoid monotony and strengthen its Page 183 184 appeal, an idea may often be expressed in different ways. Fourth, make your knowledge conversational; learn to talk about the Bible in an interesting manner with families and friends. Draw out well-informed persons of your acquaintance. Interesting experiences in reading the Bible will be related in class if Relief Society women feel at ease and in tune with the spirit of the lesson being presented. Fifth, learn to interpret the Bible in the language of our own times and apply it to present-day problems. Literature of any period is interpreted according to the student's knowledge and experience. First, Plan Your Lessons Ahead If earnest preparation is begun well in advance, most problems will take care of themselves. My most practical help in doing this is to keep a sheet of paper, or 4 notebook, handy, on which to make notations or references. Close by the telephone, where no one will disturb it, is the most convenient place for me to keep it. Any information receive from a ward leader over the telephone can be easily jotted down, or if a request comes for some special help, once it is written down it is not so apt to be overlooked. If an interesting thought comes over the radio while I'm about my work, it takes only a minute or two to write it on my handy sheet of paper. Then, when I'm ready to organize my material and commence the actual preparation of a lesson, I need not waste valuable time searching for something which I am sure 1 have some place. I also have a small notebook, 4 looseleaf, which I carry in my purse. In it, I take notes on meetings which I attend, copy interesting items which I read, or make a record of references for future study. When I begin to segregate my material according to its value for a particular lesson, I always have my notebook, the sheet of miscellaneous notations, and my Magazine at hand. These time-saver ideas simplify lesson planning and give me the feeling that an important part of the work is accomplished with comparatively little effort. I have also found that a dictionary and a Bible which is self-pronouncing are almost indispensable. By reading the lesson in the Magazine as soon as I receive it, 1 keep in mind the subjects of the lessons to come. Then in the margins of the Magazine, I make references to in formation which I find in my reading. I always have my Magazine with me. It requires so little space to carry and is a congenial companion with which to spend a few minutes. We used the lesson previews in the Magazine and study helps as a basis for discussion at the one planning meeting which we held in September. I tried to anticipate the problems which would need special consideration. Generally speaking, the ward leaders felt that this year's work would duplicate last year's lessons in some cases. Since then, however, we have come to know that the Bible is indeed a book of "hidden treasures." Against the background of last year's study, this season's lessons have been easier to present and more satisfying. Second, Build an Atmosphere It is important to build an atmosphere HOW | HELP WARD LITERATURE LEADERS which will furnish a background for and add significance to the lesson to be presented. This was demonstrated in the presentation of the lesson on the Creation. Wherever possible in the wards of our stake, parts of the oratorio, The Creation, by Haydn were reproduced on the piano, organ or phonograph. The music departments in the wards and stake cooperated wholeheartedly in making this possible. In some wards the story was successfully told to the musical accompaniment. In other wards the music was used as an introduction to the lesson or as a fitting climax. Well-chosen hymns which correlate with the lessons also add variety and interest, and can be sung as trios, duets, or solos with instrumental accompaniment. ' Short stories have been used to good advantage in centering the attention of a class of busy Relief Society women upon the subject at hand. Stories can be arranged to a convenient length for readings. Appropriate verses from the Relief Society Centennial Anthology of Verse are adaptable for this same purpose. Bits of poetry will often guide the trend of thought in a class to the subject of the lesson and incidentally illustrate the influence of the Bible upon the world's literature. Topics given by ward members on timely subjects related to the lesson have a wealth of possibilities as interest builders. Information can be found in current periodicals and library magazine files. I seldom look for some specific information but that I find something else of interest and value. All of these suggestions have been used in our wards. 185 Third, Know Your Sources of Information Know your sources of information; read your Bible. Both reading and talking about the Bible add comprehension to the study of it. Since I hesitate to rely upon my own understanding of the Bible, I take the precaution of naming the authority from which I quote. These quotations I feel free to pass along to the ward leaders by mail, by telephone, and through personal contacts. I have combined the best maps and pictures into a valuable scrapbook. Inasmuch as we have twelve wards in our stake and four wards sharing two chapels, I often visit two ward literature classes in one month. My scrapbook is very helpful in the preparation of the lessons. I started it last year and now it contains many pictures and maps cut from old copies of the National Geographic; souvenirs from Palestine sent to me by my brother who is with the army air corps in the Middle East; an interesting story of present-day Palestine from an old copy of the Improvement Era; news items; and typewritten copies of interesting information which I have gathered from my reading. This scrapbook is now one of my most interesting possessions. It has been my greatest source of ready information, always close at hand, the result of efforts both large and small. It has been used in many of the wards in its entirety and sections of it have been used in other wards. Copies of the typewritten information have been sent to all ward literature leaders. | also have a very good condensation of the story of Palestine taken from Carpenter's Travels. The librarian at our public library 186 has arranged a reserve shelf of books dealing with a study of Bible literature, for the convenience of ward class leaders. Current issues of the Improvement Era have interesting information, concerning ancient Israel; and The Children's Friend has recently published an interesting series called "Birds of the Bible." Fourth, Make Your Knowledge Conversational Learn to bring the Bible into daily conversations with your families and friends. Practically every day some faith-promoting incident is related over the radio, and a reference is made to this "Book of Books" which is acquiring added significance for many people. There is hardly a family who doesn't have some member in the service of the United Nations. How many testimonies are being strengthened by prayer, we cannot tell; but most people are willing to express their views concerning the Bible. By talking with the ones who have made a study of the Bible, through what we read, and in the light of what we, as Latter-day Saints know, we come to a clearer and broader understanding of its spiritual as well as its literary values. Upon several occasions I have consulted the director of the Latter-day Saint Institute in our town concerning questions which have come up in my preparation of lesson material. He has promptly referred me to information which I can study for myself. I have recommended that every ward literature leader take advantage of the Bible classes which he conducts one evening each week during the college term. It is a privilege which is appreciated by class leaders. When possible, it is a good plan to read current books dealing with Bible times. The Robe by Lloyd C. Douglas is a very fine example of what Christianity can do in the lives of people. The Nazarene and The Apostle by Sholem Asch give very fine descriptions of conditions at the time of Christ and the Apostle Paul. Joseph and His Brethren by Thomas Mann or any of the other three books by this author dealing with the life of Joseph increases the reader's understanding of social customs and family life at that time, even though all the context may not be in accordance with Latter-day Saint belief. Fifth, Learn to Apply to Present Day Learn to interpret the Bible in the Janguage of our own time and apply it to present-day problems. The literature in the Bible is written in the setting of Bible times. Unless we interpret it in the light of our own time, it may seem abstract. The Gleaner Girls of today do not spend their time as did Ruth, yet they are often actuated by the same high principles. The story of Hannah is being lived by countless mothers in their care of and anxiety for their sons who may be in distant places. The story of Abraham's calling is applicable to the calling of men to the apostleship of our Church. The class leader who reads with the view of increasing her knowledge of Bible literature is rewarded with a feeling of joy in the work, which adds vitality to her lesson presentations. No class leader could expect her class to show enthusiasm over a study of Bible literature if she herself lacks enthusiasm. A good literature HOW I HELP WARD LITERATURE LEADERS leader studies industriously to broaden her own knowledge of the Bible and thereby win the interest of her class members. I sincerely appreciate the splendid cooperation of our ward. Literature leaders. I'm certain that they are 187 using their influence to bring Relief Society women closer to the inner spirit and true meaning of the Bible. I know of no finer opportunity for service nor one which pays more rich dividends in adding richness and meaning to life. FOREVER Jeanette P. Parry I saw the moon slip down the stairway of the night, And from the vastness of the dark I heard the dreary fog horns blow. 'Stirred by the deep cool breezes of the dawn The sea's great tongue lapped on the sand? The traveler that visits shores of many climes And holds within its turquoise depths The crimson tragedies of war, And, on its crested waves, the gilt of sunlit peace, That knows the sorrowing of mothers' hearts And lovers' tender partings on the sands. The surge of years has never changed its rhythmic way? The constant lapping of the sea An echo of eternity.
