Wist Ye Not That I Must Be About My Father's Business?"

IV?THE EATING OF THE PASSOVER MEAL
SO JESUS, bodily wearied by the long day during which he too may have fasted, trudged alongside Joseph as they left the Temple enclosure on their way to eat the Paschal supper.
Normally, the pilgrims would enter the Temple enclosure over the "Tyropoeon," or "Royal Bridge," then go eastward, thence northward thence westward, around the inner court on three sides, and leave by the gate at the northwest corner of the Temple enclosure. If Joseph and Jesus left this way, they would go directly back into the city and thence to their lodgings, if in the city. If they were lodging in Bethlehem, and left by the same gate, they would move southward through the Upper City or Zion, then down through the Dung or Potters Gate, into and across the Valley of Hinnom and so to their destination. If they were going to Bethany, they might (if Jewish tradition be reliable) leave the Temple by a gate on the east, the "Shushan Gate," that opened into the Valley of the Kedron, and take the road leading thence across to the Mount of Olives, and on to the home of Lazarus and
the two sisters, Mary and Martha. Or if that route were not open, if the "Shushan Gate" be a tradition only, then out the northwest gate of the Temple enclosure, thence northward around the Palace Antonia, thence eastward and out the Sheep's Gate or Benjamin's Gate, and thence to the southeastward across the Valley of the Kedron and on to Bethany.
Scholars believe that this was Jesus' first visit to the Passover but there is nothing in the scriptural record specifically so stating, and the conclusion is apparently founded upon the fact, already alluded to, that at twelve years a boy became "a son of the law" subject to the fasts and under obligation to attend the feasts.
On the other hand, we have the fact that Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover, and if they were so faithful in performing this commandment, one may well assume they would follow the other command of the Lord to instruct their children, at the Paschal supper, in the meaning of the ceremony, and this they could not do if Jesus and not present at the Paschal feast. 152/ John 4:6. 153/ See Maps; sub voce I New Biblical Atlas (American Sunday School Union) 1855, P- 523 Bible Atlas (American Tract Society) 1862, Plate Vi; Case's Bible Atlas, 1880, Plate IX; The Temple, P. 14. 154/ Edersheim I, p. 247: Andrews, P- 108; Wiess, The Life of Christ, I, p 276.155/ See n. 6, supra 156/Luke 2:41, 157/See n. 62 supra JERUSALEM AT THE TIME OF CHRIST Looking to the northward are two ranges of hills running north and south separated by the Tyropoeon Valley. On the east is Mt. Moriah, site of Herod's Temple. This mount was separated from the Mt. Of Olives to the east by the Valley of Jehoshaphat or Kedron. On its southern end was located the City of David. The western range of hills had Mt. Zion at its southern end called the Upper City. To the northward or eastward was the Lower City. To the south and west of the western range lay the Valley of Hinnom 142 So, with all deference to the scholars, one may be bold to suggest that Jesus had several times before partaken of the Paschal meal in Jerusalem, and so, as he now went wearily to their lodgings, he looked eagerly forward to the eating of the satisfying supper, with its accompanying spiritual experiences. For nothing must be eaten after the offering of the evening sacrifice until the Passover meal." But here also, as at every incident in this whole celebration, one cannot escape pondering how much of the past was in Jesus' mind. Preparation for the Meal When they reached their lodgings, whether in the city, in Bethany, or in Bethlehem, they would prepare for the sacred ceremony of the supper. Since the lamb was to be roasted, and was not to be "raw, nor sodden at all with water," one of the first things to be done after the lamb was brought in would be to start it cooking. It was to be roasted in an oven whole?"his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof." No part of it was to touch the oven wall in cooking, and if any part did, that was to be cut off as being unclean. The lamb was roasted on a spit of pomegranate wood, one piece thrust through the lamb lengthwise from mouth to vent, the other crosswise near the forelegs, so that the two pieces of wood made a cross. Pomegranate wood was used because 158/ Moulton in Hastings, sub voce ''Passover." cit. 161/ The Temple, p. 199; Kitto, sub voce "Passover." 163/ Kitto, op. Cit. 166/ Deut. 32:14. 164/ Kitto, op. Cit. it would exude no sap." In all that was done to the lamb it was strictly commanded that no bone should be broken. Doubtless while the lamb was cooking, other preparations for the meal were completed. There must be unleavened bread (at least two, perhaps three, cakes); some "bitter" herbs (either lettuce, endive, succory, ?charchivina,"or horehound) apparently made up into a sort of salad; the sauce "charoseth," must be made ("or rather a sort of wine or fruit cake composed of raisins, dates, figs &c stamped or pressed together" to resemble clay); Moulton says vinegar was added, symbolizing the clay from which they made the bricks in Egypt; the "Chagigah" for the 14th of Nisan must be prepared, which need not be roasted but cooked in some other way; and last-. Ly, the wine, which must either be "the pure blood of the grape" or it must be boiled, so as to destroy all fermentation (apparently the "unleavened" ? unfermented ? character of the bread must apply to everything eaten or drunk, during the meal). Each person participating in the feast must drink at least four cups of wine (2.5 pints), even if the purchase money therefor came from the "poor box," or from labor, or from pledging one's clothing." Water might be used in place of wine, the rule being: "Their drink during the time of the feast is either fair water or raisin wine prepared by themselves, but no kind of leaven must be mixed." 159/ Ex. 12:9. 160/ Moulton, op. 162/ The Temple, p. 204. 165/ Hastings, sub voce "Passover," par. III. 167/ The Temple, p. 204; Moulton, op. Cit. 168/ Kitto, op. Cit. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS How the Passover Meal Was Eaten By the commandment of the Lord, the first?Egyptian?Passover was to be eaten "with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your - staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's passover." But at the time of this Passover, the Passover was eaten in the manner of a Roman feast; the partakers came clad in festive garments; they ate reclining on couches arranged around the tables; and instead of haste there was a deliberate leisure to show that they were free from bondage." The First Cup of Wine When all was in readiness for the feast, the head of the family, or the most eminent guest, sitting down with the guests, took a cup of wine and blessed it: Blessed art Thou, Jehovah our God, King of the Universe, who hath chosen us from among all people, and exalted us from among all languages, and sanctified us with Thy Commandments! And Thou hast given us, O Jehovah our God, in love, the solemn days for joy, and the festivals and appointed seasons for gladness; and this the day of the feast of unleavened bread, the season of our freedom, a holy convocation, the memorial of our departure from Egypt. For us hast Thou chosen; and us hast thou sanctified from among all nations, and Thy holy festivals with joy and with gladness hast Thou caused us to inherit. Blessed art Thou, O Jehovah, who sanctifiest Israel and the appointed season! Blessed art Thou, Jehovah, King of the Universe, who hath preserved us alive and sustained us and brought us to this 'season!" The one offering the blessing then 169/ Ex. 12:11. Temple, op. Cit. The Temple, p. 206. 170/ The Temple, p. 201. 173/ Lees in Kitto, sub voce "Passover." 143 drank his cup of wine, and each guest present did likewise. The Washing of Hands Immediately following this, another blessing was offered for the washing of the hands, not by pouring the water on the hands, but by dipping the hands in the water. Some believe that it was at this point in the Last Supper, that Jesus washed the feet of the Apostles." The Blessing on the Food and Tasting the Bitter Herbs The Passover table was now brought in, on which were the bitter herbs, the unleavened bread, and the "charoseth," also the body of the Paschal lamb and the "Chagigah" for the 14th Nisan." The master of the family then blessed God that He had created the fruits of the earth, took some bitter herbs, dipped them in salt water, ate some himself, and then gave some to the others at the table to eat, none "eating less than the size of an olive." The Discourse to the Children And the Second Cup of Wine Then the table was removed from before him only, who was to give answer to the question of the child as to the meaning of all this. (Edersheim suggests this was done to arouse the child's curiosity. )** Then the second cup of wine was poured. The Lord's commandment to Israel in Egypt was: And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ve by this service? 171/ The Temple, p. 205. 172/ The 174/ Lees, op. Eit: aps 144 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses." Accordingly, when the second cup was filled, the son, either of his own volition or from prompting, would say: Why is this night distinguished from all other nights? For on all other nights we eat leavened or unleavened bread, but on this night only unleavened bread. On all other nights we eat any kind of herbs, but on this night only bitter herbs. On all other nights we eat meat roasted, stewed, or boiled, but on this night only roasted. On all other nights we dip (the herbs) only once, but on this night twice." Then the father instructs the child in the history of the deliverance from Egypt, including, it would seem, the whole story from 'Terah, Abraham, and on down, the explanation being pitched to suit the intelligence of the child. The Preliminaries to the Eating of the Paschal Lamb The table with the lamb was now placed back in front of the one presiding, who would say: This passover which we eat is in respect: that the Lord passed over the houses of our fathers in Egypt. Holding up the bitter herbs, he would say: These bitter herbs that we eat are in respect that the Egyptians made the lives of our fathers bitter in Egypt. Holding the unleavened bread in his hands, he would declare: This unleavened bread which we eat is in respect that the dough of our fathers had not time to be leavened, when the Lord appeared unto them and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy; and they baked unleavened cakes out of the dough which they brought out of Egypt. He then said: Therefore we are bound to confess, to praise, to laud, to glorify, to honor, to extol, to magnify, and to ascribe victory to Him who did unto our fathers and unto us all these signs, and who brought us forth from servitude to freedom, from sorrow to joy, from darkness to marvelous light and we say before him,*? Then the first part of the "Hallel" was sung: The Singing of the "Hallel" PSALM 113. Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised. The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high. Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. He maketh the barren woman to. Keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord. PSALM 114. When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 170/ Ex. 12:26-27, 177/ The Temple, p. 206; Lees, op, cit, 178/ Lees, op. Cit. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS 145 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
They then all repeated this short prayer:
Blessed art Thou, Jehovah our God, King of the Universe, who hath redeemed us and redeemed our fathers from Egypt.
The Second Cup of Wine
The second cup of wine was now drunk.
The Second Washing of the Hands
Then with the same blessing offered before the first washing of hands, the hands were washed for the second time.
The Eating of the Meal
This ceremony finished, the eating of the real meal began.
One of the two unleavened cakes was then taken by the one presiding and broken, he using both hands, as he pronounced the blessing:
Blessed be Thou, O Lord our God, the King of the Universe, who bringest forth food out of the earth.
A piece of this bread was then handed to each of those who surrounded the table by the one presiding, saying:
This is the bread of affliction which our fathers did eat in the land of Egypt.
All then ate unleavened bread each one so wishing, dipping the bread in the "charoseth."
It is believed that it was at this point in the Last Supper that Jesus identified his betrayer by handing him a bit of unleavened bread dipped in the "charoseth"?the sop.
The one presiding then blessed God and then ate of the "Chaggah" (when brought); he again blessed God, and then ate of the lamb.
The company then began eating, leisurely, at the same time discoursing on religious subjects, until they were satisfied. When they had finished, they ate another piece of the Paschal lamb, even if no more than "the size of an olive," for the taste of this was to remain in their mouths.
The Third Cup of Wine
After this, the third cup of wine was filled and blessed in the usual manner, and then drunk, each one of the company repeating after the one presiding, the words which he uttered. This is considered to be the "cup of blessing."
Some scholars affirm that it was at this point in the feast that the Savior, using the ceremony over the third cup, introduced the wine of the sacrament at the Last Supper.
While scholars seem not in accord on the details of the concluding ceremonies after the third cup was drunk, Lees gives them as follows:
Following the drinking of the third cup, a blessing was pronounced, thanking the Lord for the food they had eaten, for the deliverance of their fathers from the Egyptian bondage, for the covenant of circumcision, and for the laws given by Moses. 179/ The Temple, P. 207 180/ See n 172 Supra 181/ See 8. 104:14 182/ John 13:26, 183 Cor. 10:16 184/ The Temple, P. 209; Lees, op. 26:27, 186/ Lees, OP. Cit 146 The Fourth Cup of Wine Then the fourth cup was filled while this praise was sung: All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee." Then the wine was blessed with the usual blessing" and drunk. Singing of the "Halle!" This ceremony was accomplished by the singing of the remainder of the "Hallel'': PSALM 115. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. The Lord hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 187/ Ps. 145:10. 188/ See n. 171, supra. He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great. The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your children. Ye are blessed of the Lord which made heaven and earth. The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence. But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the Lord. PSALM 116. I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: | found trouble and sorrow. Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. I believed, therefore have I spoken: | was greatly afflicted: I said in my haste, All men are liars. _ What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. MY FATHER'S BUSINESS I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people, In the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord. PSALM 117. O praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise ye the Lord. PSALM 118. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever. Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. Let them now that fear the Lord say, that his mercy endureth for ever. I called upon the Lord in distress: the Lord answered me, and set me in a large place. The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. All nations compassed me ahout: but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them. They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the Lord helped me. The Lord is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in 147 the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord. The Lord hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord: This gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter. I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. The stone which the builders refused ls become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord. God is the Lord, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. Thou art my God, and I will' praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. The Fifth Cup of Wine Normally, nothing but. Water should be drunk after the fourth cup, but sometimes a fifth cup was added in which case the "Great Hallel" was repeated: PSALM 136. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever. O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him that stretched out the earth 148 above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever: The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever: The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever: And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever: With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever: And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever: But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever: And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever: And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever: Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever. Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever: And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever. Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever. O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever. The Benedictions to the Ceremony In the normal case?when the supper ended with the fourth cup?the whole ceremony ended with the so called "blessing of the song," made up of two brief prayers: All thy works shall praise Thee, Jehovah Our God. And Thy saints, the righteous, who do thy good pleasure, and all Thy people, the house of Israel, with joyous song let them praise, and bless, and magnify, and glorify, and exalt, and reverence, and sanctify, and ascribe the Kingdom to Thy name, oh, our King! For it is good to praise Thee, and pleasure to sing praises unto Thy name, for from everlasting to everlasting Thou art God. The breath of all that lives shall praise Thy name, Jehovah our God. And the spirit of all flesh shall continually glorify and exalt Thy memorial, our King! For from everlasting to everlasting Thou art God, and besides Thee we have no King, Redeemer, or Savior." These were the benedictions of the ceremony, which must be concluded not later than midnight." Thus ended the Passover meal. Whatever of the lamb had not been eaten must be burned before the next morning." The foregoing seems to be the order of the celebration of the Passover at the time Jesus attended the ceremonies when twelve years of age. For the youth Jesus this had been a long and arduous day. He must have been greatly awearied, as also Joseph who had done so much and so many things during the many busy hours that had passed since, in the morning, he and Jesus had left their lodgings for the Temple and its ceremonies. Jesus must now have gone hastily to his couch and to rest." 189/ The Temple, p. 210. Became awearied on occasion, see John 4:6. 190/ Moulton, op. Cit. (To be concluded) 191/ Ex. 12:10. 192/ That he became awearied on occasion, see John 4:6.
