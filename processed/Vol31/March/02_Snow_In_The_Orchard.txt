SNOW IN THE ORCHARD Eva Willes Wangsgaard Strange is this fruit which weighs the orchard bough, Steely and white, stiletto-sharp and cold; Pale reds and yellows leap from facets now On branches lately hung with apple gold. The rhythm, which all summer pulsed to fill The living green of leaf and stem and fruit, Is silenced; and the empty veins are still, At rest while life renews within the root. Soon all this crystal brittleness shall blend Into the fragrance of warm blossoming; And every freshened artery shall send A richer current back to meet the spring. Beside these rigid limbs my heart must hold To scented boughs and arches hung with gold. The Cover: The cover picture, "Spring Sky" (Salt Lake Valley), is from a photograph taken by T. J. Howells, M.
