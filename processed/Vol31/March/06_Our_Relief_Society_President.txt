OUR RELIEF SOCIETY PRESIDENT Marguerite Burnhope Harris She came with quiet dignity and grace, A stranger in our midst, but stayed not so, For soon she found a work and came to know A host of people, who saw in her face True love and service for the human race. She brought them peace, and caused their faith to grow, While always in her eyes that radiant glow That won for her, within their hearts, a place. Whene'er the call to duty for her came, She answered promptly, "Here," and faltered not, But hastened to comply, and ever sought To brighten and lend sunshine to life's game. So let us follow in her footsteps dear, And when our call comes let us answer, "Here." "
