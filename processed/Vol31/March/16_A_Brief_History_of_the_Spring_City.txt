A Brief History of the Spring City Relief Society. Related by Bergetta Jensen, President. [The Magazine prints this account of the activities of the Spring City, North Sanpete
Stake, Relief Society as being typical in many ways of other Relief Societies. ? Ed.] AN organization known as ?A Female Relief Society? was organized in Spring City, May ID, 1868, under the direction of Bishop C. G. Larsen and Counselors James Allred and Peter Rasmussen. Mary Ann Price Hyde was sustained as president with Elizabeth Allred as 1st counselor and Anna N. Larsen as 2nd counselor, Sarah Ellis as treasurer, and Elizabeth Fretwell as secretary. On May 13, 1868, another meeting was held and six teachers were appointed. The time for holding
meetings was set for the first Thursday in each month at 2 p.m. An entrance fee was given by each member which usually consisted of a few pounds of wool yarn, quilt blocks, scraps of cloth, or anything that might be converted into something usable. At first, the organization consisted of fifteen members, and on the 13th of May 1869, the enrollment had grown to 104 and the charitable receipts and expenditures for one year made a balance of $105.20. On November 10, 1870, the cornerstone for a Relief Society Hall was laid on the city lot owned by the Relief Society. A granary was later erected on the same lot and
the building of the Hall was abandoned on the advice of the Authorities who deemed it advisable to center our efforts in the erection of a new meetinghouse for the ward. In June 1870, the grasshopper pest threatened the valley and the
sisters made efforts to save the crops and glean all they could. Sister Lizzie
was sent to Manti by the Relief Society to learn to braid straw and make hats, and in turn teach the sisters that all might have hats. In the year of 1874, *^^ sisters were asked to plant mulberry trees and begin the raising of silk worms
which was undertaken but afterwards abandoned. On the Fourth of July, 1876,
marking the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence,
the Relief Society was invited to arrange for a fitting celebration. The brethren built a bowery and the sisters supplied an appropriate program with a feast, and dance for all in the evening. The Exponent was then known as the Relief Society organ, and through this paper. President Brigham Young advised the sisters to store wheat for a time of famine. In December 1876, came a call
for the Society to do its bit toward the building of a temple at Manti. Many hundreds of dollars were donated besides carpets, rugs, fancy work, etc., that were given to help beautify the building. In December 1878, the Relief Society
deeded one-half its lot to the School Board, on which to erect a school building.
Page 181 182 In the year 1879, many new Saints arrived and much was done toward making them comfortable for the winter. Much gleaning was done and wheat stored this year. September 20, 1881, President Eliza R. Snow and Emmeline B. Wells visited the ward Relief Society. In eight years, the Relief Society had donated $800.00 in cash to the Manti Temple besides helping to feed and care for those who labored in its erection, and was pleased to help furnish and decorate it with the articles before mentioned. The first 17th of March celebration was held in 1892. Each one in the ward was invited to attend, and a large gathering resulted, each person bringing a lunch basket, prepared to spend the day. An inspiring program consisting of songs, testimonies, dialogues, readings, reminiscences, etc., was given. At noon, luncheon was served, after which the program continued, and closed with a dance in the evening. For many years this was the day on which the annual fee of ten cents was paid by each Relief Society member as a means of assisting in the general expense of the organization. At a conference held this same year, the report showed 55,000 bushels of wheat stored by the Relief Societies of the stake. This year, the women made much homemade cloth, hosiery, and much apparel for the poor. Again the sisters gathered grain, and it is to be noted that under the direction of President Tulgreen the granary was spotlessly clean, free from mice or vermin, and in every way was typical of Relief Society ideals. The San Francisco disaster of 1906 called for help in the line of quilts, food, soap, clothing, and cash, which was readily responded to. World War I opened the way to explain Relief Society work to many people who had not known of it previously, but were willing to help. Much sewing, knitting, quilting, and other work was done. Beautiful lessons for each meeting had -been introduced into our Society, and a "Baby Day" was featured, at which time sixty-five babies were examined by doctors. Then came the dreaded flu epidemic and again was the call heeded for financial help and nursing assistance. In 1923, came the call for stored wheat. The Government needed it, and wheat to the amount of $3,416.79 was sold. The money was placed (according to counsel) in the Presiding Bishop's Office in Salt Lake City. The interest money from this wheat fund was used for maternity and _ child-welfare work. Clinics for school children continue to be held. During the years 1923 to 1928, a great amount of temple work was done by the Relief Society. In addition to caring for the sick, the poor, and other duties incident to regular Relief Society work, the sisters visited the homes, and encouraged all to try to do temple work. During one year alone, work was done for more than one thousand people for the Spring City Ward.
