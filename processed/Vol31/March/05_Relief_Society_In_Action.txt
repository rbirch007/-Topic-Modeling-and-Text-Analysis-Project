Relief Society In Action Today President Amy Brown Lyman WITH the widening of horizons for women in the last one hundred years, it has been an observable fact that women in general throughout the country have been called upon to participate in practically all relief and assistance organizations set up or established for the purpose of giving help and comfort to those who are in need. The necessity of wider recourse to feminine help is now readily admitted. Not only have women been called upon to give personal service to individuals and families, but also to assist in extensive planning programs in the interest of health, child welfare, education, and other community needs, and to help in raising funds for such enterprises. And in all this work for humanity they have willingly assumed a full share of responsibility. Women are especially well fitted by nature for welfare work. They seem naturally to be able to alleviate distress, to eliminate bitterness, and to lessen despair. In turn, such work is very satisfying to them for, as the Prophet Joseph Smith once remarked, it gives them the opportunity to exercise their humanitarian instincts. While it is true that women are somewhat subjective in their way of feeling and more personal in their approach or way of considering problems, still they are often nearer the true situation than if they tried to solve a difficulty in a more objective way. They have a very acute sense of situations and are often, through this, able to cope successfully with very difficult problems. They have sympathy, imagination, patience, a spontaneous eagerness to help, and a warm good will, all of which are real assets and help them to find their way easily into the hearts of those who suffer. For a full century, Relief Society women have served their Church with distinction in the field of human welfare, working in connection with and under the supervision of their bishops. And today they are devoting themselves wholeheartedly to the great Church Welfare Plan both in production and distribution. They are freely and willingly giving their service and their accumulation of knowledge and experience to this great cause. Their hearts are in the work, and they are devoted to it. Relief Society women were among the earliest of American welfare workers and have, through the years, instituted many interesting and unique features of human helpfulness. Perhaps no other group of workers in this field has undertaken such a variety of tasks, both in early pioneer days on the plains and later in the far West. In addition to giving succor to those in distress, they have also practiced neighborly assistance one to another which has been outstanding. They have seemed to really love their neighbors as themselves. While their educational and cultural programs from the beginning have been interesting, comprehensive, and even outstanding, Relief Page 137 138 Society women have always given their major effort and have devoted their best interest to human welfare work, which was the original assignment given them by the Prophet Joseph Smith. In all phases of work, however, which have been undertaken by them, they have shown courage, vision, resourcefulness, efficiency, earnestness of purpose, and great capacity for leadership. PICTURE of the Relief Society in action today is very interesting and enlightening. We see this great army of women attending regular meetings, special classes, and lectures. We see them sewing, quilting, and remodeling clothing, working at canning centers, preserving fruit and vegetables for themselves and others. We see them visiting monthly all the families of the Church?carrying messages of hope and good cheer, making, in addition, special visits to the sick and homebound, and giving many hours of voluntary service to the sick. We find them in homes where death has entered, comforting the bereaved. Although the 1943 annual report has not yet been completed, and figures indicating exact accomplishments are therefore not yet available, Relief Society work for 1943 was continued along the same lines as in 1942, with increased emphasis on participation in the Church Welfare production program, particularly in sewing and canning projects, on first aid and home nursing, and volunteer service in connection with Latter-day Saint hospitals. Figures from the 1942 report will give an indication of the extent of activities and services continued during 1943. We find that 54,244 regular meetings for members were held in the wards and branches throughout the organization in addition to many special and preparation meetings. In these regular meetings each week the same courses of study were considered simultaneously. How interesting is the thought that the members everywhere were, at the same time, discussing the same subject, thinking along the same lines, and receiving the same type of development. In addition to the regular Relief Society courses of study, several thousand Relief Society women completed Red Cross courses as follows: home nursing 3,839, first aid 4,062, nutrition 1,701, all others 620, making a total of 10,222 w0- men completing Red Cross courses. This work was continued and reemphasized throughout 1943. The report of the extensive sewing program is very interesting. During 1942 at the monthly sewing meeting, an average of 28,705 Wo men took part. In these meetings 7,721 worked for the Red Cross while 20,984 sewed articles for other purposes. The number of hours given to sewing altogether was 381, 868: for the Red Cross 100,125, for all other purposes 281,743. Articles completed for the Red Cross _numbered 38,381, for Church Welfare 19,446, for the Society 59,055- The kinds of articles finished were quilts 13,034, other bedding 4,610, children's clothing 25,323, women's clothing 10,141, men's clothing 7,908, other miscellaneous articles 55,866. Indications are that the 1943 report will show an even greater quantity of sewing accomplished, and will show that 1943 was the RELIEF SOCIETY IN ACTION TODAY greatest quilt-making year yet recorded in the history of the Society, for in addition to the usual number of quilts made, the Society undertook an assignment by the Church Welfare Committee of approximately 4000 quilts which were turned over to the bishops' storehouses. The General Board also recommended that all Societies in war risk areas provide themselves with ward first-aid supplies, including 12 quilts or blankets. It was also suggested that a check be made to learn whether all families were adequately supplied with bedding and that assistance be given where necessary. Many stake and ward Relief Societies conducted bedding projects for the benefit of families within their boundaries. In 1942, there were 210,346 hours spent on Church Welfare projects, principally in canning and other types of food preservation?a service which was continued in 1943. Also in 1942, 209,371 visiting 139 teachers made 1,196,168 visits to families and 116,006 additional visits were made to the sick and homebound. There were 15,083 days given voluntarily to the care of the sick; 882 bodies were prepared for burial, and Relief Society women assisted at 4,315 funerals. The Society paid out for charitable purposes $87,882 in cash, and $5,930 in merchandise. In January 1943, the organization had 107,282 members located in branches in all of the states of the Union, excepting New Hampshire, in Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia, and in twenty-one other countries. Little did the original members of the organization realize, as they walked to and from their meetings in Nauvoo, how great their beloved Society would become in 100 years. Wisely has it been said that effort can be fully evaluated, not by what the hours, but what the years and the centuries say.
