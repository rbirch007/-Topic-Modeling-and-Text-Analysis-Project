[This is the first instalment of the last article in the series by Dr. Creer on the historical backgrounds of some of the countries involved in the present war.—Ed.]
THE story of the Jews in world history, despite its interest, is a pathetic story of national impotence. For only a century have these hapless people enjoyed any real freedom or any semblance of political greatness. For the rest of their history, despite their continued occupancy for some one thousand years of their homeland in Palestine, they were never independent of external influences, never able to pursue without risk, a self-respecting policy, never free from the potential or actual interference of greater powers. Israel was subject to Syria, dismembered by Assyria, enslaved by Babylonia, and, finally, conquered and annexed by Rome. And yet the Jewish nation with no home, has made every nation its home; through good and evil fortune, it has preserved its nationalism so intact that no nation has been able to treat its Jewish citizens as a negligible quantity, nor to disregard the peculiarities of their customs and prejudices.
With the conquest of Turkey by the British in 1917, and the dramatic entrance of Field Marshall Viscount Allenby into Jerusalem, on December 17 of that year, thus ending Moslem rule in Palestine which had existed since 1244, the hopes of the Zionists to re-establish a National Home for the Jews were revived. The Zionists were encouraged in their efforts through the publication

of the celebrated Balfour Declaration by the British in 1917, notice of which will appear later in this article. With the rise of Hitlerism and the advent of World War II, renewed Jewish persecutions in Nazi controlled areas have made the problem of Jewish rehabilitation extremely acute. It is estimated, for example, that of the 3,500,000 Jews originally in Poland, not a quarter of a million still live. Those who do are protected by non-Jewish members of the underground, or live like cave men, in the Polish forests. "They live to tell a story, not to save a people." But, as one authority says:
Those Jews who live have learned one thing: a people without a homeland of their own is doomed. What Theodor Herzl preached long ago, while "the most highly civilized Jews" of Europe refused to listen, has been proved in our lifetime. And from one end of Europe to another, Jews sit down and weep, are they weep, because they remember Zion. (THOMPSON, To Whom Does Palestine Belong, page 6)
But the founding of a National Home in Palestine for the Jews is not so simple. For more than twenty years, efforts in this direction have been thwarted by inter-racial, foreign, and domestic complications until today, the cause of the Zionists appears to be more hopeless than ever. But before reviewing the chaotic events associated with this problem, let us first turn our attention to the resources and physiographical features of the country itself. PALESTINE | 685

PALESTINE Palestine, the Holy Land, consists of very dissimilar districts and borders on regions of equal diversity in character. To the south lies a mountainous desert; to the east, the elevated plateau of the Syrian steppe; to the north, the republic of Lebanon; and to the west, the Mediterranean Sea. In the general configuration of the country, the most striking feature is that it does not rise uninterruptedly from the seacoast to the eastern plateau; but is divided into two unequal portions by the deep Jordan valley which
ends in an inland lake, known as the Dead Sea. Palestine embraces 10,429 square miles—an area equal in size to that of the State of Vermont—and includes a population of 1,600,000 (estimate of 1944), of which 550,000 are Jews. It is primarily an agricultural country. The principal crops are wheat, melons, grapes, olives, and figs. The citrus fruits are chiefly oranges and grapefruit. Wine making is an extensive industry. Minerals found are limestone, sandstone, and gypsum. The valley of the Jordan and the shores of the Dead Sea yield rock salt and sulphur.
Since 1920, Palestine has made remarkable economic progress, thanks to Jewish money and the initiative of the Zionists. More than $50,000,000 has been expended within the country during the last fifteen years. In addition to the reclamation of land and the increase of its agricultural productivity through extensive irrigation and intensive farming, much Zionist capital and labor have gone into projects of industrialization. Through the operation of the Palestine Electric Corporation, under the Rutenberg Commission, all the water power of the Jordan River has been utilized; under the direction of the Palestine Potash Limited, a Zionist corporation, not only a priceless supply of potash, but also bromides and other mineral salts have been extracted from the Dead Sea for commercial use. The Nesher Match Factory at Acre, and the Necker Cement and Shermen Oil Factories at Haifa are further examples of large scale industries.
Before World War I, there were in Palestine 1235 industrial undertakings, most of them Arab; in 1933, there were 5200, of which 3000 were Jewish, employing 16,000 workers. In 1937, the number of Jewish enterprises was 5,606, employing 20,549. The area of land in Jewish possession had increased from 102,150 acres, in 1926, to 250,000 in 1938. A Hebrew university was established at Jerusalem, in 1925.
Lastly, the Zionists have made a contribution of another and rather unexpected sort. They have organized model collective farms and various types of co-operative societies. These have made for solidarity in the Zionist communities and have, at the same time, furthered the economic welfare of the Arabs. The
examples of economic collaboration and co-operation. These societies, many of which are managed by the Histadruth, or Jewish Federation of Labor, cover banking, credit and insurance, contracting, transportation, marketing, irrigation, and even land purchasing. There are also producers' and consumers' co-operative associations.
IN all the perplexed and turbulent history of the Palestinian mandate (1922-1944), a few salient points need to be sufficiently clarified. The essence of the present Arab-Jewish tension emerges from certain facts, however much the facts themselves may appear to be obscured by accidental incidents. Two races inhabit Palestine today, both of which are there of right and not of sufferance. Both races are entitled to hope for national expansion, coupled with social and economic betterment; and both have cultural and spiritual affections with the land they share in common. Both peoples, too, advance claims based upon promises and commitments by the Allies, particularly Great Britain and France, which appear to be vaguely and quite inaccurately understood. Both races, in fact, are not necessarily or wholly incompatible, neither are they mutually antagonistic "except in so far as their respective and conflicting ambitions make them so." The crux of the problem is that both races are intensely nationalistic and aspire to political ascendancy.
The Arab case is based on three considerations: First, the Arabs were in actual possession of Palestine before World War I began. The population of Southern Syria was ninety per cent Arab in 1914, and Syria had been Arab since the seventh century A. D. Second, the Arab nationalists claim that they have earned the boon of independence, because they aided the British during World War I against the Turks. This fact, however, be it noted, is less true of the Palestinian Arabs (who did not rise as a body against the Turks) than of their kinsmen in other parts of Syria. Third, the Arabs of the Hedjaz and of Northern Syria had extracted a promise of independence from the British Government in October 1915, as the price of their collaboration with the Ain 1914, and Syria had been Arab since the seventh century A.D. Second, the Arab nationalists claim that they have earned the boon of independence, because they aided the British during World War I against the Turks. This fact, however, be it noted, is less true of the Palestinian Arabs (who did not rise as a body against the Truks) than of their kinsmen in other parts of Syria. Third, the Arabs of the Hedjaz and of Northern Syria had extracted a promise of independence from the British Government in October 1915, as the price of their collaboration with the Allies. This promise, embodied in the so-called McMahon Pledge (a communication written by British High Commissioner of Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon, to Sheriff Hussein of Mecca) granted political independence to the Arabs within certain territorial limits, and with the important reservation, note, that "British promises could be made with respect to those regions only wherein Great Britain was free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally, France." Furthermore, be it noted "Jerusalem and Palestine were never mentioned by name anywhere in the McMahon Pledge. By inference, however, Palestine was excluded." (Age of Conflict, page 397.) The first modification of the McMahon Pledge was made in May 1916, when Great Britain signed the Sykes-Picot Agreement with France and Russia. In this document, prospective areas of French control and spheres of influence were outlined. Thus the British gave specific recognition to the "French interests" referred to in the McMahon Pledge. 687 But, at the same time, the Sykes-Picot Agreement specifically provided for the erection of an independent Arab state or a confederation of Arab states; and it also made provision for the placing of Palestine and the Holy Places under a special international agency of control "with a view to securing the religious interests of the Entente Powers." Promises to the Jews with respect to Palestine were also made by the British, but subsequent in date to both the McMahon Pledge and the Sykes-Picot Agreement. The important Balfour Declaration of November 2, 1917 (a communication from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,' Alfred Balfour, to Lord Rothschild, leader of the Zionist Movement) stated that the British Government viewed with favor the founding in Palestine of a Jewish National Home, "it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine." Again, it is important to note that the Jews were never promised that Palestine would be established as a predominantly Jewish state, but merely, that Palestine would become an area available for Jewish refugees who desired there to found for themselves a National Home. And here again is the crux of the question restated. Both Arabs and Jews, for nationalistic reasons, are determined to constitute the majority race in Palestine. UCH was the situation at the end of World War I; and British and Zionist officials at once sought to obtain Arab acquiescence to the fulfillments of their wartime commitments to both races in Palestine. At first they were successful. At Paris, in 1919, the Emir Feisal, official Arab representative at the Paris Peace Conference, showed a commendable willingness to collaborate. Feisal agreed to accept the Balfour Declaration, however, only on condition that the Allies set up a single Arab state in the interior, with its capital at Damascus. At the Conference, he is reported as saying: "If the Arabs were to rule a_ state stretching from Aleppo to Mecca, they could afford to allow Lord Balfour's small Palestinian notch to be occupied by the Jews." And his interesting comment: "The Jews are very Close to the Arabs in blood, and there is no conflict of character between the two races." (Age of Conflict, pages 399-400. ) But Feisal was doomed to disappointment. In March 1920, a Congress of Syrian Notables assembled at Damascus. On this occasion, Feisal was offered and accepted the crown of Syria and Palestine. This action, however, was at once repudiated by the Allies who forthwith called the fateful Conference of San Remo, where, in April 1920, the Council of the League of Nations conferred the mandates for Syria and Lebanon on France, and the mandate for Mesopotamia, Trans-Jordania, and Palestine on Great Britain. The wrath of the Arabs knew no bounds. Disappointed in not securing tacit recognition of an independent Greater Syrian Kingdom, the enraged Nationalists focused their opposition not only against the unpopular French-imposed mandates, but also against the aspirations of the Zionists in Palestine. It is also unfortunate that the San Remo Conference completely disregarded the recommendation of the King-Crane Commission, which, in 1919, had urged the incorporation of Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine into a single mandate because of the predominantly Arab population in these countries. This action of the San Remo Conference violated another. Promise, the Anglo-French Declaration of November 7, 1918, which had explicitly assured the peoples of Palestine, Syria, and Iraq that they were to have a voice in the eventual establishment of their prospective administrations. (To be continued ) THE LOST CHILD Alice Morrey Bailey My child is lost, as in Jerusalem A child was lost long years ago. Did his mother's feet, in panic Wildly seek him to and fro? Did she, too, fear evil men? And did her heart so dully beat? Did she, in terror, scan the crowds And call him in the empty street? Did her fingers touch with longing His recent kiss upon her face? Oh, God, I pray that I, like she Find my son in a holy place.  Be Strong, My Heart! Marguerite J. Griffin HE world is bathed in blood— the blood of the youth whose destiny should have been its hope, its strength of tomorrow. The world is haunted with hunger—with gnawing famine that emaciates the body. The world is polluted with pestilence more destructive than disease carried forth on every wind—it is the hate of men... The world is steeped in sorrow. Nearly every heart feels _ its touch. Nearly every home hears its step. And I, in my small selfishness— I had dared to give thanks that my sons were young, too young to hear this call to arms. But that was a year ago, when my oldest boy could only touch the trolley strap with his finger tips, when he had to cling to my hand, or, if he wished to be more independent, to the vertical bar placed at intervals for that purpose. Yes, that was a year ago at Christmas time, but this year— The trolley was crowded. We had to stand. I was thinking of many things. How there was not much Christmas happiness upon the faces of people. How there were lines of anxiety instead. A pregnant girl, sitting nearby, was wistfully reading a letter and looking at snapshots it contained of a soldier's company, of the soldier alone, undoubtedly the father of her unborn babe. My heart twisted at the calm look of resigned courage that filled her young face as she, at last, folded her letter and put it away. Perhaps this was not the first time she had read it. Perhaps this was all she would ever have.. But here was I, with my little brood of three safely clinging near me, going to a_ well-established house, where night would welcome, home the security of a loving father. Here was I with so much. My eyes turned thankfully to my children, and then I saw the thing that made me gasp. My brood was clinging to me, did I say? Yes. All but my oldest son, and he was hanging to the strap quite comfortably, not stretching to make it, but with plenty of slack in the bend of his elbow. Last year—only last year he could not do it! How fast a boy becomes a man! Why was I so blind not to see? What made me think I would be spared? There was a woman, I knew, whose boys during World War I were young like mine. She was thankful for that, then, too. It was easier to see brother or husband go than this flesh of her flesh. But today one son is in Italy and the other in England. That was today. Tomorrow? Who knows? How fast a lad of eleven becomes a man in a militant world where boys are called men at eighteen! Will my heart never cease pounding with this thought? His face is young. His eyes full of dreams. What kind of a world will it be in seven short years that pass like the tush of wind? What kind of a mother will I be? Let me find the courage to take what life may bring! Let me fortify 689 

my heart so that nothing can my heart so that nothing can break through to agonize my soul. Pain of body, that is bad, but pain of soul, that is worse. Science has done much to find healing medicines for the flesh, but for the sickening heart hurts of men, what is there? For the pain a mother feels when she reads the words: "Regret to report . . . Missing in action. . . ." Dear God, what is there then?
THAT is it! That is the answer! That is the solace! As a little child who meets with sudden grief runs blindly home, calling, "Mother! Daddy!" So do we in moments of direst pain call out instinctively to the Father of us all: "Dear God." And in that calling our pain is a little more bearable, for the Maker of us all knows the hearts of men. In time of stress we cry out. We cease to question the proposition, is there a God. We know.
That night the warmth of my home seemed more cozy. The laughter of my children seemed more blessed, my husband's arms more protective. The walls, the dishes, the rugs, the hearth all gleamed with a poignancy I had never seen before. There was the feeling in my heart that I must love every minute of time, for it was ticking away, slowly, surely, yet with a speed that was breath-taking. In my little world there was peace and quiet. In the big world not so far away were guns and blood and pain. And in my own heart there was no tranquility now. But I must find it! I must not be burdened with dread, with fear! I must fortify against the future so I might cling to that faith that burned as bright-
ness of each moment, until—until—come what may.
That night after the children were in bed, I took down my Bible. I opened it and read. I had always loved the Bible. I had read a little in it, from time to time. I had loved the beauty of its words, the poetry of its phrases. I had taken a course in Bible Appreciation once. But tonight as I read with a heart made mellow by fear and dread, I caught the Spirit that was clothed in those words: "Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
Oh, America, why have your Bibles been gathering dust upon the shelves these many years? Know you not that your very forebears forsook the ancient lands across the seas that they might worship God according to the dictates of their consciences? In the main, they came not for gold, for adventure; for they were peaceful men and women, lovers of home and industry. They came for freedom. Freedom from more than shackles upon the flesh. They came for the glorious freedom of the soul, freedom to worship God, freedom for the pursuit of happiness.
I am thankful for every one of my forebears who came to this land of liberty. It was sacrifice to come so far to an unknown land, to start life over again. But because of their sacrifices I was born here upon a blessed, upon an abundant land. Their toil has been my heritage. And what have I done with it? I had forgotten what they gave their blood for. I had forgotten why they did it, until now when the battle is being fought all over again. And what of the Book—that Book of Books that brought with them, from which their children first learned to read, the Book that formed the philosophy of their justice one with another—that Book which some of their descendants had nearly forgotten?.. But today, mothers buy a pocket edition for their sons as they leave the family hearth, as they sail across the seas. BE STRONG, MY HEART And this new youth, serious, shaken, is reading the timeless pages, drinking deep from the well that is never dry, that is waiting for the finger to open a page, for lips to breathe the words: "Come unto me and I will give you rest." Rest to the wounded, rest to the weary, rest 691 
to the heart-broken. "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls." So I must learn of him who gave his only Son. I must strengthen the defenses about my soul, that America may be truly strong without and within, that she may hold a little higher her Torch of Liberty to shed its healing rays upon despairing peoples everywhere. "Wherefore, take upon you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand." To the future then, whatever may come —Be strong, my heart! BETHLEHEM THE BLESSED Alice Whitson Norton There is a city strange and old, Hemmed in by fields of grain, Dust on its quaint, old, battered walls, For centuries has lain. Yet, ever in its pulseless heart Remains the secret deep, "T'was here the wise men first beheld God's infant Son asleep. "Twas here angelic hosts appeared Above the bare old earth, To broadcast with a loving voice, The blessed Savior's birth. And where that blessed baby lay, Tonight the stars smile down, A silent benediction on This well-remembered town. It Isn't the Gifts Olive W. Burt [This story relates another episode in the lives of the appealing orphans, Janet and Stevie —Ed.] JANET, packing her few, small J belongings into the battered suitcase she'd found in the basement, tried to hide the bitter disappointment that was burning like tears behind her eyes. She put a bright, false smile on her lips and looked at her small brother, Stevie, who was slamming his own pajamas and clean shirts and socks into another small suitcase. Janet couldn't blame Stevie for being unhappy; she was desperately unhappy herself—and she was old enough to understand things. Stevie, looking up and seeing Janet watching him, said, "It's just like sending us back to the—home!" and tears he'd been holding back began to fall. | Janet went and put her arms around him. She understood that he was referring—not to their own going away from this little house where they had been so happy and had so much fun—but to sending Spot to a "dog's boarding house" for the next week or two. "Now, Stevie!" she begged, "Spot's going to have lots of fun— he'll be with a lot of little dogs and they'll have everything nice. Remember when daddy and mommy took us to Denver and we stayed in a hotel? It was fun, wasn't it? Well, Spot's going to have fun." "Will they have a Christmas tree for him?" Steve asked haltingly. "I wouldn't be surprised!" Janet said, "And maybe it'll be loaded with big bones and packages of dog candy!" Page 692 Stevie smiled, forgetting his trouble for a moment. He and Janet had come across small packages labeled "dog candy" in the five-andten-cent store, and had been delightfully surprised to learn that dogs were taken care of in this essential matter. The little boy looked happier as he went on with his packing. But Janet wasn't happier. She looked ahead to the two weeks of Christmas vacation with dread. It was going to be the worst Christmas —the very worst—she had ever had. And she had thought it was going to be so lovely, with the new baby and all! Early last summer, Mrs. Allen, who had taken Janet and Stevie from the orphan's home and made them very happy by loving them, had told Janet that she was expecting to have a new baby of her very own. Janet had been scared, right at first, thinking it would make a difference in the Allens' feeling toward her and her small brother. But she had found out that it made the Allens love their little adopted children even more than before. Janet and her "mother" had had great fun planning for the new baby—making tiny clothes, lining a bassinet, getting together all the doll-sized things necessary. Then, suddenly, Mr. Allen had had to go to war, and a good deal of the joy had left the little house. Mrs. Allen had tried to be gay and cheerful as always, but Janet could see she was worried. Stevie, who had been a pal to his daddy, was lonesome. And IT ISN'T THE GIFTS Janet, who adored the tall, good-natured man with a special adoration, felt an emptiness that it seemed nothing would ever fill. She had hoped the baby would come and liven things up a bit. Then she had come home from school on this last day before Christmas vacation to find Mrs. Peterson, a neighbor, waiting for her. "Your mother's gone to the hospital," Mrs. Peterson said bluntly, "and you and Steve are to stay with me until she can come home again." Alarm gripped Janet. "Is she going to be all right? Has the baby come?" she asked. "She'll be all right, I guess," Mrs. Peterson said casually. "But your mother isn't as young as she might be, and it's not so easy to have your first baby at her age." "The baby hasn't come, then?" Janet was watching the neighbor, trying to read in her face the things she wasn't saying. "No. And it may be several days yet. No one can tell. Your mother got sick this afternoon, and Dr. Small said she'd better go to the hospital, even if they were so crowded they didn't want to take anyone in that could stay out." Janet was still more frightened. She and her mother had _ talked about that, and Janet was sure Dr. Small would never have ordered her mother to the hospital unless she was pretty sick. "Daddy!" she cried, "does daddy know?" "Your mother had me send a telegram to him, but there's been no answer as yet. But you'd better get some things into a bag—just your nightclothes and toothbrush and comb—you can run back here for 693 clean clothes as you need them. For Steve, too. But I won't have that dog in my house. Tippy would hate it." "But what can we do? Leave Spot here all alone!" "I told your mother I'd take care of you children, but not the dog, and she told me to call the dog boarding house and have them come and get him for a couple of weeks." "Dog boarding house?" Janet had never heard of such a thing. It struck her funny and she started to smile. Then she remembered Stevie and the smile died. Stevie had planned on this Christmas with Spot as much as she had planned on it with the new baby, whom they had expected to be here for the big day. Now all this was changed. She and Stevie would be at Mrs. Peterson's for Christmas—and Mrs. Peterson did not like children very well, and she didn't like dogs at all. It wasn't going to be Christmas—it was going to be a lonely and sad time for all of them. | Stevie had come running up the path just then, and Janet had pulled herself together, stuck a smile on her face, and tried to make her news sound exciting and gay. But Stevie was no fool. He caught the implication of the announcement as completely as Janet had done. And now he was packing his bag with little grace. "If her old cat Tippy doesn't like Spot," he said ferociously, "I won't like Tippy.. I guess I can make Tippy pretty sorry that she doesn't like Spot. I bet—." Janet had visions of her beloved brother turning into a monster that pulled cats' tails, kicked over saucers We can't 694 of milk, and made life miserable for everyone, including himself. The bell rang, and Mrs. Peterson called, "Janet, better get that dog. Here's the man for him!" Janet thought fiercely, "If she had any sense at all she would not do it like that!" But Stevie had dashed past her out of the room. He threw his arms about the dog and clutched him close. "Listen, Stevie," Janet said firmly, "daddy told you to be the man of the house, and you're acting like a baby. Did daddy bawl and hug us when he had to leave us? You bet he didn't. He kissed us goodby and marched away like a soldier. Well—" Stevie swallowed hard. He hugged Spot convulsively, kissed his funny face and said, choking, "Go along, Spot. Be a good dog!" The man who'd come for Spot said, ""That's a big fellow. We'll take good care of him," snapped a leash on Spot's collar and led him down the path to a waiting car. Stevie stood by the window, waving, till the car was out of sight. "Come along, now," Mrs. Peterson said, not unkindly. "We'd better be getting over to my place and settled for the night." "THEY locked up the little house and followed Mrs. Peterson down the walk. Janet knew that Stevie felt as she did—that they were _ locking the door on Christmas. Just at bedtime the phone rang, and Mrs. Peterson called to Janet, "Your mother wants to talk to you." Janet flew to the phone, Stevie at her heels. "Mommy! Mommy!" she cried, relief making her voice shrill. "You're well enough to talk! Has the baby come?" Her mother's laugh was reassuring. "Pm feeling pretty fine, Janet. No, the baby hasn't come yet. Isn't that naughty—to keep us waiting like this? How are you and Stevie?" They talked. Janet was amazed that her mother's voice sounded perfectly well., It reassured her somewhat, even though Mrs. Allen explained that she would have to stay in the hospital till the baby came, and for sometime afterward. "Can we come and see you?" Janet asked hopefully, but her mother explained that children weren't allowed in that part of the hospital, and they'd just have to wait till she could come home. "I'll phone you every morning and evening to say good morning and goodnight," she promised, "and I'll have the nurse phone the minute the baby comes. And if daddy—." Only then did her mother's voice falter, and Janet's heart jerked to attention. After a very brief pause, her mother went on. "If daddy phones or writes or telegraphs you phone me. Or if anything else happens and you need me, Janet, be sure to call. I won't tell you to be good and mind Mrs. Peterson because I know you will—and we're going to have a mighty good time afterward to make up for being separated like this at Christmas. Now let me talk to Stevie a minute." Janet gave her mother a "telephone kiss" for goodnight and handed the receiver to Stevie, who was jumping up and down in his impatience to hear his mother's voice. Well, Janet thought, it's up IT ISN'T THE GIFTS to me. She'd have to help Stevie make the best of this strange Christmas in a strange house. Maybe the baby would get here before Christmas, after all. And if it hurried real fast, maybe Mother could get home for Christmas. But there wasn't much hope of that. The days passed slowly. Janet helped Mrs. Peterson all she could, but it took most of her time to keep Stevie out of mischief. 'There were no playthings and no place to play such as he had at home. Mrs. Peterson hated clutter and noise and all the things Stevie adored. So, though Stevie generally got along famously with women—they adored his dark, burnished curls, and his shy, friendly smile—Mrs. Peterson and the little boy were always at outs. And not only was Janet continually on the alert to keep Stevie out of trouble, but she was continuously worried over her father and mother. Her daddy hadn't written or telephoned or telegraphed—and that meant only one thing to Janet. He'd been sent overseas and was being exposed to all those fearful things she'd seen in the movies. Every time she thought of her father she said a little, breathless prayer without words—just her heart calling to God and reminding him that her daddy needed a little special care right now. And then there was anxiety over her mother and the baby, and the disappointment over Christmas. Janet felt, sometimes, as if her thin little shoulders would break under their load of worry. Every time the phone rang she tensed and waited, longing to fly to it, to hear daddy's gentle, deep voice or her mother's reassuring promises. 695 So when, on the second day of their stay with Mrs. Peterson, she heard a strange woman's voice, her first feeling was disappointment. But excitement welled up at the words, "Janet, your mother asked me to call and tell you that you have a new baby sister!" "Oh!" cried Janet. "A sister! Oh, daddy will be glad! Can I come and see her now? How's mommy?" "Your mommy's just fine. And the baby is lovely. But I'm sorry, Janet. They just won't let little gitls come to the hospital to see the new babies. You'll have to wait till your mommy brings it home." "But when will she come home?" The nurse laughed a little. "Not for a few days." "How many?" Janet insisted, calculating swiftly that Christmas was still five whole days away. "Well," the nurse hesitated, "we've been sending mothers home on the fourth or fifth day if they had someone there to take care of them, because we're so crowded. But in this case—I'm afraid your mother will have to stay ten days, or maybe two weeks." Janet's last hope died. Her mother couldn't possibly get home for Christmas, then. Tears filled her eyes, and she knew that she had been counting on that, counting on their all being together with the new baby for the special day that was meant to be kept by families held close in love and companionship. She managed to say goodby and turned from the phone, unable to keep back her tears any longer. Janet hated to cry. She had known little girls at the Home who cried over the smallest things—cried and sniffed and did nothing about 696 their troubles, so Janet had no patience with them. She _ had always found it better to think a way out of her difficulties and not waste tears on them. But today, even the joy of having a tiny new baby sister was not enough to keep the tears away. Janet ran to the little bedroom Mrs. Peterson was letting her use, threw herself across the bed, and sobbed. But she wasn't allowed to have her cry out in peace. She had no sooner abandoned herself to disappointment than she heard a loud and startled yowl from Tippy, followed by a scream from Mrs. Peterson, and a stream of angry shouts. Janet's tears dried as she jumped from the bed and ran out. She knew instinctively that Stevie was in trouble, and, without a thought, she flew to rescue him. She did. She caught his flying figure as Mrs. Peterson reached for it. Above Stevie's head, Janet's eyes pleaded with the woman. "I’m sorry," she said. "Maybe Stevie didn't mean to hurt Tippy. Oh, Mrs. Peterson, let's put him in the bedroom a minute and _ talk about what we should do." It took all Janet's tact and persuasive powers to save the day from tragedy, but she knew that she couldn't go on mollifying Mrs. Peterson. She also knew that she would just die if the woman ever struck Stevie. THAT night she lay straight and still on her bed and thought. The nurse had said they could send mothers home in four days if they had someone to care for them. Four days—that would be Christmas Eve. If only they had someone to take care of mommy! There ought to be someone, some place. Surely there were nurses to be hired? But you'd need money. Well, she had money. Janet got up and went to her little suitcase. She rummaged under the clothes and found the little box that held her Christmas money. Seven dollars and twenty cents! It was a great deal of money. Janet had saved it to buy special presents for those she loved: a football for Stevie; a rose bowl for her mother; a wallet for daddy; a rattle for the new baby. Now, as she looked at her little hoard, Janet thought, But Christmas isn't just presents! It's something else—something inside you. If you haven't got that, all the presents in the world won't make you happy. And if you have got it, you don't need gifts. We can't ever have that something if Stevie gets bad, or if we're all scattered and unhappy. She looked at her money again, and made up her mind. The very first thing the next morning she called the hospital, and, in the most grownup voice she could assume, she asked if they had nurses to rent, and how much they cost. The girl at the hospital explained carefully—there were no nurses to go to homes. So many had gone to war and to hospitals where wounded soldiers were. There just weren't any left. And she didn't know where Janet could find one. Janet hung up the phone. Her plan hadn't been any good after all. Then she set her jaw stubbornly, and went into action again. The city newspaper had an information department that would answer any question you asked. Daddy had often called for baseball scores and mommy had asked for recipes. IT ISN'T THE GIFTS Janet dialed the number and asked, "Where can a person rent a nurse?" The girl who answered questions thought a minute. "Have you tried the Visiting Nurse Association?" she asked. "What's that?" Janet wanted to know., The girl explained. Then she went on, "If you can't get anyone there, why don't you call the Relief Society of the Latter-day Saint Church? I understand they have good, practical nurses who will go into a home to help in case of emergency, at a very reasonable price." "Oh, thanks!" Janet almost yelled. "T didn't know that.' She hung up and her fingers were trembling as she dialed the number of Mrs. Gilmore. Mrs. Gilmore was a friend of mommy's and she was president of the ward Relief Society. Janet breathlessly told her problem. "And I've got money to pay," she said, "seven dollars and twenty cents!" Mrs. Gilmore's voice was gentle as she answered, "Why, of course, Janet. I think I can get someone to come. I'll see what I can do." The next moming Mrs. Gilmore called Janet, and it was all arranged. A woman would help Janet get the house ready, and then she'd come in and take care of Mrs. Allen as long as she was needed. Mrs. Gilmore had called the hospital and _ they said mommy was well enough to come home in an ambulance on the next day—Christmas Eve! Janet ran to Mrs. Peterson. "You've been awfully good to Stevie and me," she said, "and it was kind of you to take us in and take all this trouble with us. But mommy 697 wanted to be home for Christmas— and she can come home—the doctor said. So do you mind if I go over to get the house fixed up? Mrs. Gilmore is sending a lady to help." Mrs. Peterson smiled down at Janet, and Janet was surprised to see how kind looking she was. "l help, too, Janet," she said. Between them they got the little house all spick and span, the front rooms decorated with Christmas greens and paper chains that Stevie worked so hard to make he didn't have any time to get into mischief. They got mommy's bedroom ready, with the bassinet on two chairs near the big bed. GTEVIE and Janet stayed that night at Mrs. Peterson's, but they were over home again bright and early the next day, working and planning. Whenever Janet thought of the gifts she had meant to buy, she felt a funny little pang. But it wasn't regret. No, she was keeping the seven dollars and twenty cents to pay for the nurse. And that was all she could give the family. Mrs. Peterson phoned for Spot, and he got home early in the afternoon. The reunion between Stevie and the dog was something to see, and Janet felt that her money was well spent if only this one happiness came from it. A little later the ambulance backed up to the curb and mommy was brought into the house on a stretcher. She was a little pale, but smiling, and oh, so happy to be home, and oh, so proud of the tiny bundle she held carefully against her breast. As soon as Mrs. Glenn, the woman who had come to nurse mommy, allowed it, Janet and Stevie went into the bedroom and stood looking at their mother and baby sister. They climbed up onto the big bed and watched the tiny newcomer take her dinner. Watching, Janet felt something swell in her throat. It was just like the picture of Mary with the baby Jesus. She had never dreamed anything so lovely would ever come into her life— so near that she could reach out and touch it. Without knowing she was singing, Janet began, ''Silent Night, Holy Night," and Stevie joined in. Janet saw her mother look at her with bright, happy eyes, and then she, too, began to sing. None of them heard the door open or saw someone enter and stand looking at them. They finished their song and the silence that followed was broken by the deep voice they all loved so well, familiar and hearty, but with a strange catch in it, ''Beautiful, beautiful Christmas!" And there was daddy! Bigger and handsomer than ever in his beautiful uniform. No one knew how it happened, but there he was, beside the bed, with Mommy and Stevie and Janet and tiny Carol in his arms all at once— And he was crying— their daddy was crying! Janet buried her face against the rough, nice smelling jacket and let her own tears fall. But only for a moment. Then daddy had them all laughing. He was looking at the baby and his face was comical. "Is that what we've made all the fuss about?" he asked, and winked at Janet. Then he said to Stevie, "We men folks will have to watch out around here, now the women have outnumbered us— if you think that s crap will ever be a woman! It was Christmas Eve and they were all together once more— just as Janet had dreamed they would be some day, just as she had secretly prayed they might be this very Christmas. She didn't have any presents for them — she didn't believe there was a present in the whole house. But what did that matter? She could explain about her money tomorrow, and daddy could explain why he hadn't telephoned, and mommy could explain why she had been rushed to the hospital, and Stevie could explain what he'd done to Tippy— if they wanted explanations. Janet didn't— I don't want a single thing more, she thought happily. This is the real Christmas. It was lovely!

Cannon First Assistant General Superintendent in the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association THE famed autumn weather of Salt Lake Valley was at its best during the three days of the 115th semi-annual conference of the Church, October 6th, 7th, and 8th. Those admitted within the gray walls of 'Temple Square found it an island of beauty. Due to the restrictions of travel, this was again a Priesthood conference—leaders of stakes, wards, and quorums, mission presidents of continental United States, Canada, and Mexico, and general boards of men's auxiliaries. 'There were seven regular sessions, including the Priesthood meeting Saturday evening, and two separate meetings Friday evening for Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood leaders. Each session lasted two hours. The music was mostly congregational with appropriate male solos, but on Saturday evening the male chorus of the Tabernacle choir stirred the great audience, and Sunday morning the full choir made the customary broadcast, the 795th, and sang for the Columbia Church of the Air program. All of the regular sessions, except Priesthood meeting Saturday evening, were broadcast over KSL from Salt Lake City, and KSUB from Cedar City, and the Sunday morning session over KFXD at Nampa, Idaho. Thirty of the thirty-one general authorities were present, Elder Alma Sonne, Assistant to the Council of the Twelve, filling a call to Hawaii. A spirit of gravity pervaded the gathering. The men had come when traveling was difficult and time very precious, some of them suffering bereavement through war casualties, and practically all filled with anxiety for sons or brothers in the service. President David O. McKay conducted the meetings. The outstanding event of the conference was the appearance and address of President Heber J. Grant. 'The hearts of the men of Israel rejoiced to see their leader in his accustomed place. His message, read by Elder Joseph Anderson, had the typical clarion quality of President Grant's sermons, stirring the saints to repentance and activity, and it had a remarkable comforting influence as well. In faithful parents whose children have not followed in their footsteps, the President revived hope: There comes to mind an experience in connection with my brother, Fred, after our father died. Because of the mistreatment of a stepfather, and neglect, as a young man my brother ran away, and J was told by Brother Mariner W. Merrill, at that time bishop of Richmond, Utah, that the night after my brother ran away, he, Brother Merrill, went to bed rebellious. And that night, so Brother Merrill told me, he had a dream in-which he saw my brother in all kinds of wicked company in many different states, and he saw that a light surrounded him. In the dream he said: ""What does that light mean?" And a voice answered: ""That is the influence that a faithful, God-fearing and God-serving father can have over a son to keep him from going astray, and to eventually bring him back to the truth." Years later when my brother did come Page 699 700 back and joined the Church, as I related here last conference, he fulfilled Brother Merrill's dream, because Brother Merrill said that he saw him laboring all over the Church, bringing wayward boys to a knowledge of the truth, and he did labor from Canada to Mexico in that service. To those who have suffered the death of loved ones, President Grant offered sympathy, telling of his own bereavements and the sustaining power of the Lord that had come to him. The President's address also contained a plea for the clean life, a theme which became very strong in the following discourses: I want it understood that the use of liquor and tobacco is one of the chief means in the hands of the adversary whereby he is enabled to lead boys and girls from chastity. Nearly always those who lose their chastity first partake of those things that excite passions within them or lower their resistance and becloud their minds. Partaking of tobacco and liquor is calculated to make them a prey to those things which, if indulged in, are worse than death itself. And the President sounded another of the conference themes with his appeal for prayer: I have little or no fear for the boy or girl, the young man or the young woman, who honestly and conscientiously supplicates God daily for the guidance of his spirit. I am sure that when temptation comes they will have the strength to overcome it by inspiration that shall be given to them. I am convinced that one of the greatest and one of the best things in all the world to keep a man true and faithful in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, is to supplicate God secretly in the name of his Son, for the guidance of his holy Spirit. The head of the Church of Christ invoked blessings "upon Israel and upon all honest men everywhere," "all the men and women who preside in all the stakes of Zion throughout the Church, in all the missions, in all the quorums of the Priesthood, and in all auxiliary organizations," and on "every man and woman who is laboring for the salvation of the souls of men and keeping the commandments of God." May he bless our youth away, and us at home, and give his direction to the leaders of nations, and speedily bring about the accomplishment of his purposes. May he bless you, one and all, and every honest man and woman that lives upon the face of the earth. PRESIDENT J. Reuben Clark spoke of another matter that was frequently referred to by subsequent speakers, that of preparing for the return to the men from the service —spiritual postwar planning. Our children have gone out into the battle fronts. We have sent them out as" boys, as children in experience. We are going to have them back as premature men who have undergone trials of which we know nothing. Some will return, we hope most of them, triumphant over temptation and sin, seasoned in righteousness and courage and everything that goes to make a man of God. Some, however, are going to come back wounded in spirit, with questions in their minds. What are we going to do with them?... What kind of homes are we going to have them come home to? Will they be homes of contention, of discord, or will they be homes of patience, charity, of righteous living, or homes of confidence and of love and respect for their fellowmen? Are we going to bring them back into Latter-day Saint homes and then nurture and rebuild them until they get back to normal spiritually? This is a bit of postwar planning that we can do now. Seek the spirit of the Lord, ask his help, that our families can live righteously and be prepared for these boys when they come home. 115TH SEMI-ANNUAL CONFERENCE President David O. McKay gave a stern warning that there will be continuing war on the earth if we do not overcome the evils that brought on the last two world conflicts. He pleaded for the spirit of justice and brotherhood. After all the suffering, after all the destruction of human life, shall we be so blind as to have it start all over again? If the germ of hate is permitted to develop, if strong nations strive to dominate the weak as Mussolini did to Ethiopia, as Japan did to Manchuria; if the few ruling nations mighty in the implements of warfare, seek to dominate weaker nations and tell them how to live and what to do; if they seek success only in materialism and shut their eyes to the value of human souls; if they reject the teachings of Christ and pursue their selfish interests, history will repeat itself and the world will be plunged into another war, and again the Lord in pity and sorrow will weep over the folly and blindness of the human race. It was estimated that ten million people listened to the choir broadcast and Church of the Air address. The latter, by Elder Ezra T. Benson of the Council of the Twelve, set before America the Lord's promise, recorded in the Book of Mormon, that this is a choice land and will be free from bondage and captivity and from all other nations under heaven if the people will but serve the God of the land, Jesus Christ. Every session was filled with practical suggestions for better living with spiritual incentive. Some of these follow: It is not plain how God hears and answers prayer, but he does. Through adjustment of quotas, we will receive a much larger number of chaplains in the armed forces. California has grown from a weak mission to strong stakes and populous missions. 701 The golden rule should show the way in professions, politics, and all phases of life. All should struggle to co-ordinate belief and practice. There is wonderful virtue in work, without which faith is dead. - God cannot be found by study alone. Salvation by government is delusive. The duty of the Priesthood is to cultivate the souls of the Church. Better dead than alive unclean. The plan of God is here to fertilize the fields of the Church. Young Latter-day Saints are bearing arms to the number of 70,000. Settle problems through the Holy Ghost, righteous living, thinking, and prayer and the counsel of the Authorities. Do away with the madness of pleasure. There is no question so important as religion. Joseph Smith invaded economics, science, and spiritual fields, and time moves toward the proof of his teachings. Prayer will not avail much if we do not repent of our sins. The gospel plan has many fields of activity, and we should follow the program of the Church. Make a habit of reading some thoughtful matter fifteen to thirty minutes a day. Learn to think for yourself. Patriarchal blessings should be sacred to those who receive them. This conference has been a cry of repentance, Sons and daughters should not scheme to make their parents objects of charity. It is just as logical to fail to pay tithing as to fail to pay taxes., There is a tremendous responsibility o mission presidents to adjust young men and women to their work. To act on the thought that the end justifies the means is monstrous. It is a wise man who knows what to seek in prayer. It was a great conference—great in its spiritual and also its social: influence on a million people. The thousands returned to their homes with strengthened faith in the great work, and deepened love for their leaders. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman’s Exponent, December 15, 1884 “THE RIGHTS OF THE WOEN OF ZION, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOEN OF ALL NATIONS’ Christmas. Editorial There is no holiday in all the Year With so many endearing recollections, SO many charming reminiscences, such tender associations, and altogether Such wonderful fascination hanging over and around It, as Christmas. It is the day of days, with the children more specially when they expect all Sorts of gifts and treasures. No wonder the children love the day, it is the time most prescient of good to the, and to all mankind. The birth time — the sweet and touching story of the Savior's birth
never grows old, no matter how oft told. Christmas Eve! when the selfsame stars that guided the wise men of Bethlehem shine down upon us, and we feel such a holy presence, such a reverential awe, as though angels were hovering near, and with glad songs of rejoicing were echoing back from the ages past Hosannahs to God in the Highest; Peace on earth and good will to all mankind. How the human heart clings to those words divine with their answering aspirations. How they lift the soul into a higher region of thought and feeling. And the little ones partake the spirit of the day and interpret in their own simple but eloquent way every expression of sentiment and fancy that is uttered or felt by the older people. . . .Sometimes fortune divides the family circle, and for a time some one is missed of the loved ones who helped to make the chain complete; but if only absent for a time "on pleasure or on business bent" — it is not right to murmur or wear a brow of sadness, for "to be parted in body is not to be estranged in soul — and many a dream — and many a vision may pass before the mind of one whose lips are silent." There is one thing all should do at Christmas time, if they wish to emulate the Savior and do honor to "the babe in Bethlehem born," and that is, to remember the poor, and out of the substance God has given to each, donate liberally to those less fortunate — let none go cold or hungry on that day, lest their cries should enter into the ears of the
Lord of Sabaoth for a testimony against those who heed not the injunction: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, ye have done it unto me."

A Reverie: If there is anything that is really comforting when I want to collect my thoughts, and peer far into the future, or call up a vision of the past, it is to sit in the dusk of evening, or when the rest of the household have retired, all alone in a dim shadowy room in front of a grate full of live, red coals — sit and dream, wide awake, O such delightful dreams! though tinged with sadness. Imagination, however, must be vivid and the moon must be decidedly reflective. The mind can wander away then even into green lanes, where one hears merry voices, and sees troops of boys and girls, and their laughter rings out so clearly that it makes me start, and although I sit here by the fire in
bleak December, I feel the warmth of the sunlight and see the blue sky overhead, and I see many, many curious and familiar places and people; in fact I dream so long that I wonder whether I am my real self, or if the morning will find me going about my accustomed duties. What thoughts spring up and resolve themselves into such real substances, as to almost take on shapes of things, unseen, and yet to the mind tangible. We feel and know that the heart beats still, that we are sensible to feeling, therefore this must be only a dreamy phantasy, a reverie, but we can see things that are not, yet things that were. . . .
