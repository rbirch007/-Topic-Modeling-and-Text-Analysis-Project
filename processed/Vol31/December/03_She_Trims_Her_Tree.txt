SHE TRIMS HER TREE Ruth H. Chadwick. She trims her tree alone; this pinnacle Of dwarfish pine, its man-made roots. Secure In mounds of cottoned snow, becomes a lure Of resined plumes, a tinseled miracle. The tortured emptiness that fills her walls, Bereft of boyish sounds and manly ways, Yields willingly to memories, ablaze With joyous Christmases that she recalls. In retrospect, so long ago it seems, She hung her baby stocking by a tree Aglow with candlelight, and watched to see — The gilded angel catch a star's soft beams. Around her childhood tree an aura clings, To symbolize the joy that Christmas brings. The piney scent that fills her solitude Begets nostalgic thoughts of days, full-blown _ And rich, when she played Santa to her own, And planned with eagerness each gay prelude; With pride she hung the tinkling ornaments, Twined ribboned gold in festoons, sparkling' bright, And half-concealed each colored bulbous light Among the prickly needles, green and dense; Before the shimmering tree she placed each toy— _ A slick-nosed woolly lamb, a sturdy box Of soldier men, some tools and building blocks— Then feigned surprise to share their mirth and joy. Her children's tree, a sacred ritual, Cemented hearts with love's own festival. The topmost star sends forth its jeweled rays Of scintillating light, to prick her heart And leave it yearning now for dear ones, part Of her, who travel hard and daring ways. Out there, her "boys" fight valiantly; the one, Her sweetheart through the years, and "Sonny" lad, Now soldiering so proudly with his dad; They risk their all for freedom's benison. Perhaps, tonight, they peer from fox-hole lair, To gaze at bursting flames that singe and comb The vengeful foe; then dream of stars and home, A Yuletide tree, and bow in silent prayer. She trims her tree alone, to guarantee Their dream will live in firm reality. The Cover: "Christmas At Home and Abroad" is from a painting by Elsa FE. Saxod.
