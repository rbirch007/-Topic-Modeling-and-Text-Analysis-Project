Theology Church History Lesson 6?The Missouri Period Dr. H. Wayne Driggs Objective: To study the main events in Missouri that led up to and followed the location of the City of Zion and the central gathering place of the saints. For Tuesday, March 6, 1945 PARALLEL with the rise of the Church in Kirtland was the development of its progress in Missouri. 'The far reaching command to go "to the borders by the Lamanites' (Doc. And Cov. 28:9), had sent, within the first year of the Church's organization, four of its leading elders?Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer Jr., Parley P. Pratt, and Ziba Peterson?hundreds of miles away from their eastern homes. The dawn of the new year 1831 found these men marooned near St. Louis owing to the deep drifts of snow; but when the storm abated they pushed their way afoot three hundred miles across the prairies, subsisting on frozen corn, bread, and raw pork. Upon reaching Independence, Jackson County, Missouri, they set about actively to preach the gospel to thousands of their own race, and to the Indians whose main village lay just beyond the borders of the State. So successful were their labors that by February of this year (1831), it was decided that Elder Parley P. Pratt should return to Kirtland and report the progress of their work to the Prophet Joseph. Alone, this faithful servant of the Lord pressed his perilous journey back over the stretches of the wilderness, arriving in Ohio with the cold winds of March. A joyful reunion followed. The Prophet, having newly arrived from the East, talked prophetically about the gathering of Israel which was then starting. Kirtland, he said, would be a resting place where the persecuted members from the East might gain needed strength in company with their brethren in Ohio. But the great hope and promise for the children of the Lord lay at Page 721 72 Zion which was to be in the land "on the borders by the Lamanites." Here was to be raised a new city even the exact site of which was to be revealed. Zion there was to rise "fair as the sun," and there was to be "a New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God" (Doc. And Cov. 45:64- 66). This was to be the land of their inheritance. In the bright month of June, 1831, between the third and sixth of the month, the fourth general conference of the Church was held at Kirtland. Some two thousand souls, by this time, had embraced the faith. The "little flock" of but the year before took on the appearance of a flourishing tribe of Israel. From such a joyous band were called the elders who, two by two, were instructed to go forth over the country declaring the message of good tidings from God (Doc. And Cov. Sec. 52). Thus elders journeyed toward the Missouri frontier, organizing branches of the Church as they traveled. Following the march of the missionaries came the Prophet Joseph and his party. They traveled by "wagon, stage, canal-boat, steamer and on foot, reaching Independence, Missouri, about the middle of July." (E. H. Anperson's, Brief History of the Church, page 48). Here the joy of meeting with Oliver Cowdery brought tears to the eyes of the Prophet. Not long after Joseph's arrival, the Lord made known to him the central gathering place of the saints and the location of the "City of Zion" (Doc. And Cov. Sec. 57). Independence was the chosen site, and the spot for the temple was designated as "lying westward, upon a lot which is not far from the courthouse." According to the revelation, lands were to be purchased by the saints, and the soil in the region _ was to be dedicated for the gathering of Israel, and for the building of the New Jerusalem. Sidney Gilbert was appointed a merchant and an agent for land purchases, while Edward Partridge, assisted by two counselors, was chosen to "divide the saints their inheritance," to be a judge in Israel, to receive the consecration of properties, to assign stewardship, and to receive the saints then on the way from Ohio. On the first of August, Sidney Rigdon was called by revelation to consecrate and dedicate to the Lord the land of Zion, to write a description thereof, and to prepare "an epistle and subscription to obtain money for purchasing lands for an inheritance" (Doc. And Cov. Sec. 8).: "The first step toward founding Zion was taken on the 2nd day of August, 1831. On that day Joseph, assisted by eleven other men, the whole representing the Twelve Tribes of Israel, helped to lay a log for a house in Kaw 'Township, twelve miles west of Independence, which locality the newly arrived saints from Colesville were settling. Elder Rigdon then dedicated the land. The following day, the 3rd, witnessed the consecration of the temple site, after which, in the 4th, the fifth conference of the church (the first in Zion) was held at the house of Joshua Lewis, in Kaw Township, most of the saints being present. Revelations were given  LESSON DEPARTMENT repeating some of the ten commandments, also concerning the Sabbath, and the return of certain elders to Kirtland, among whom were Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery and Sidney Rigdon." (E. H. Anperson's, A Brief History of the Church, pages 48-49) The winter of 1831-32 the Prophet spent in Kirtland, writing, receiving revelations, and working out for publication "The Lord's Preface to the Book of Commandments." Sidney Rigdon was closely associated with him in the literary ventures of this time. Persecutions grew so bitter by March that Joseph thought it wisdom to leave for Missouri again. In April he departed, Sidney Rigdon and Bishop Newel Whitney later joining him on the journey which was made in a roundabout way to avoid the fury of a mob. It was to his sorrow that the Prophet learned, upon arrival at Independence, that the enemies of his people there had started cruel treatment of the saints. - This was the beginning cloud of the storm that was to break over those assembled in the land of Missouri. Joseph remained with the Missouri saints until June, realizing all the while that signs pointed toward more trouble for his people even in the land which was promised as an inheritance. With the coming of summer he had again returned to Kirtland, there to be lost in the task of receiving other great revelations from the Lord so important for the upbuilding of God's kingdom; and to direct the plan and work of constructing a temple. Prosperity soon smiled upon the saints in Kirtland. Property amounting to over $11,000 was purchased. 723 Mills, workshops, and public buildings rose amid humming industries. Another year passed, and then, in September of 1833, came Oliver Cowdery with sad news of the persecutions of some twelve hundred saints in Missouri. 'These law-abiding and peaceful citizens had incurred the hate and jealousy of their poorly organized neighbors, who looked upon the Mormons with their professed power of godliness as instigators. Of race riots among negro slaves and Indians; and who demanded, by heavenly decree, the very land of the Indians. Mobs arose, of five hundred or more men in number, to march upon these "insolent people." Bishop Partridge was tarred and feathered, and other saints threatened and abused. Governor Lilburn W. Boggs sided in with the rioters, robbing the saints of their liberties. Then came the word that all Mormons were to leave the State, half by January 1, 1834, and the remainder by April first of the same year. "'The Mormons must go,' was the general cry. The Saints appealed to the State executive for military aid, in vain. That functionary advised them to try the law. Following his advice brought only disaster. It was like applying fire to powder. Soon the whole country arose in arms to make war upon the unfortunate, peculiar people. It was on the thirtieth and thirty-first of October, and the first of November that the most furious attacks were made. Men were beaten, houses unroofed, property destroyed, women and children driven screaming into the wilderness.... 'Armed bands of ruffians ranged the country in every direction 724 bursting into houses, terrifying women and children and threatening the defenseless people with death if they did not instantly flee. Out upon the bleak prairies, along the Missouri's banks, chilled by November's winds and drenched by pouring rains, hungry and shelter-less, weeping and _heart-broken, wandered forth the exiles. Families scattered and divided, husbands seeking wives, wives husbands, parents searching for children, not knowing if they were yet alive.' Thus were between twelve and fifteen hundred souls expelled from their homes and possessions in Jackson County, three hundred of their homes were burned, ten settlements left desolate. Most of the exiles found refuge in Clay County, just across the river, where they were kindly received." (E. H. ANDERSON, A Brief History of the Church, pages 55-57.) Word of these outrages, brought to the Prophet in the spring of 1834, caused him to organize and lead what was known as "Zion's Camp" (Doc. And Cov. 101, 103). The men who marched forth May 5th? one hundred in number?were joined by two hundred and five recruits along the way. There were young and middle-aged men in the company. Excitement struck the hearts of the enemies of the Church and the Missourians armed for the attack. It was soon learned, however, through conferences with the Prophet, that his intentions were peaceable. He asked naught but a just settlement of the differences between the citizens of Missouri and his followers. On June 25th at Rush Creek the Prophet disbanded the camp. Nothing seemed accomplished by this first marshalled force of modern Israel to assert their rights at the hands of their enemies. Leadership and loyalty for the Prophet and the cause were developed, however, among many of the men who later became pillars of strength in the Church. The Missouri period in the Church history is one of a rising and a setting sun. In the joy of seeking the earthly possessions which God had promised, the saints forgot his warning counsels and the conditions under which he had said the "City of Zion" could be brought about. God, therefore, tried his people and sanctified the land with their blood. They were tried in the furnace to be made bright and strong for the more rigorous days ahead. From Jackson County to Clay, and from Clay to Caldwell and Daviess Counties, they were driven, their property confiscated and their homes possessed or burned. The battle of Crooked River, and the massacre at Haun's Mill fell upon them amid the crimson leaves of that October in 1838. Troops joined hands with the mobs in making the rout from Missouri complete, while at the point of a bayonet the saints signed away their property. Crooked officials and false friends led them pitilessly into the armed forces of their enemies. Joseph Smith, who by this time had come to Far West, was taken prisoner, and with him went several of his close associates. Later, the Prophet and his friends were committed to jail to await trial. They remained there during the winter of LESSON DEPARTMENT cell he wrote, "Zion though she seemeth to be dead." Then in April of 1839, he and his brother Hyrum made their escape, with "the tacit permission of their drunken guards," to again join their families in the State of Illinois where Brigham Young and the Twelve had taken the saints. When the count was made of those who had survived the Missouri storm, such prominent men as Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Luke and Lyman Johnson were not to be found among the faithful, they having been dropped as disaffected members at the conference held at Far West. But phoenix-like was the Church to rise again on the very edge of the ashes heaped high by the Missouri fires, and in a city called "Nauvoo the Beautiful." Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto 725 his word" which has been written especially for out life in this day. 1. The bringing about of the Lord's kingdom in our day has been termed "a marvelous work and a wonder." How unlike other great building activities of men has been the Mormon way of developing towns and erecting places of worship? Read section 57 of the Doctrine and Covenants which names i and "spot for the temple." with a reading of section 58 and let the class "give eat and learn" the will of the Lord. Note particularly verses 21-22, 27-28. 'These may prompt discussion. Find other verses that strengthen one's * faith. 2. In photography the blackest nega tives always produce the brightest positive or picture. How can this principle be applied to the suffering of the Prophet and the saints? How, to anyone, personally? Read section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants, 4 most beautiful expression of God's love for the Prophet who was suffering in jail. Note one of the truly distinctive statements of our Mormon philosophy of leadership patterned after that of the Master, in verses 34-49- Read 'sections 101 and 103 of the Doctrine and Covenants for a further understanding of the reasons for the persecution in Missouri. Let these sections form a part of the class discussion drawing a pres ent-day application therefrom. Sections 122, 123 give words of comfort to the suffering saints and were written while the Prophet still remained in Liberty Jail. The rung of a ladder was never meant to rest upon, but only to hold a man's foot long enough to enable him to put the other somewhat higher. Thomas Henry Huxley
