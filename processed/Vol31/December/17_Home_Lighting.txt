Home Lighting Claire P. Dorius Good lighting should prevent or reduce defective vision and unnecessary waste of human resources??W. E. Barrows, Light, Photometry and Illuminating Engineering. MERE lighting of the home is not enough. Comfortable vision is what counts. Vision is a three-way operation. It takes an eye, an object, and light. When the light illuminates the object, that is good; when the light shines in the eye, that is not desirable. Light in the eye is glare; light on the object you're looking at is illumination. The eye sees an object by means of the light which it reflects. Good lighting requires freedom from glare, the elimination of shadows, and the avoidance of a sharp contrast between lighted objects and their background. The darker the paint or paper in your rooms the more light you need for good vision. Light walls and woodwork are highly recommended. Except in very gloomy weather, the home depends upon light from outside during the day. How adequate this light is would seem to be -determined by the number of windows. Glass, however, may absorb or reflect as much as thirty-five per cent of the light that falls upon it. The thickness of the glass does not seem to have much effect, but the smoothness does. Fifteen to twenty per cent of the total light may be absorbed by dirt on the glass, and in very smoky localities this may amount to as high as twenty-five to fifty per cent. Glass, in spite of the fact that it reduces the available light, plays an important part in diffusing the light, and so gives more illumination at the farther side of the room than would be obtained if no glass were there. Shades and draperies also greatly influence the amount of daylight which is available in a room. Randall and Martin found that drawing the roller shade so the upper half of the window is covered cuts sixty per cent of the daylight, but only fourteen per cent is lost when the shade is restricted to the upper fifth. A fly screen covering the whole window reduces the available daylight fifty per cent, but not more than fifteen per cent when the screen is only over the lower half. Painting the screen to prevent rusting diminishes the light further. Bronze or copper screens which do not require painting are preferable. Windows are regarded as one of the most satisfactory means of decorating a room. The use of curtains and draperies, however, may cut off as much as seventy-five per cent of the light. Removing the valance may double the available daylight at the farther side of the room. Heavy draperies and curtains increase the shadow and tend to produce a spotty condition which may result in glare, while a clean window and very thin curtain materials diffuse the light and soften the shadows. Page 719 720 In using draperies, one should consider the fact that a window area equivalent to one-fourth of the floor area is desirable. Recent use of glass bricks for wall construction has improved daytime lighting in the home. An adequate wiring system in the home should provide comfortable lighting conveniently controlled, with a sufficient number of well placed outlets to allow for satisfactory connections of portable fixtures and appliances. The type and quality of the wiring installations should be regulated by the Electrical Code of National Board of Fire Underwriters. A central light in the kitchen in an opal globe, hung close to the ceiling, illuminates all parts of the room equally. In addition, extra light Should be provided above the sink and working surfaces, so one will not have to stand in her own shadow. A well-lighted kitchen increases interest in the task and lessens fatigue. In the bedroom, a central light for general illumination, floor lamp for a special location, and boudoir lamps on either side of the dresser meet the useful needs. Boudoir lamps should be about fifteen inches tall in order to throw the light on the face rather than on the mirror. Light for reading in bed is certainly a comfort and a convenience. It should be high enough to give a wide circle of light on the book or magazine. A night light which uses a 7-watt bulb, may be plugged into an outlet near the floor in bedrooms or in halls, to cut down the danger of broken toes or cracked shins. Lights in the bathroom should be placed above or on either side of the mirror to illuminate both sides of the face equally. Eyesight conservation is extremely valuable. Sight is the only one of the senses which is dependent upon an outside agency for its functioning. Twenty per cent of elementary school children have faulty eyesight. When the children have grown to college age the percentage has doubled, and forty per cent do not see normally. Our home lighting system should provide sufficient light conveniently located to supply all needs without eye strain. This is about two watts of light per square foot of floor area. "Light is cheaper than vision." All lights should be properly shaded?shades deep enough to conceal the lamp, broad enough to give a wide circle of light, white-lined to reflect light well. Shades have a fourfold function. They protect the eyes, direct the light, soften shadows, and serve to decorate. Lamps and fixtures should be kept clean. Dust accumulating over months will absorb as much as fifty per cent of the light otherwise available. 'The deposit of dust is so gradual that a person may not be conscious of the dimming until it becomes very bad. Water is cheaper than watts.
