Modern Applications of Ethical Principles
Preview of Lessons for 1944-45
THE social service lessons outlined for this year and next will deal with the field of social ethics. Our decision to devote this much time to a study of this subject grows out of our sincere belief that much of the confusion and despair in the modern world results from man's inclination to desert the great moral principles of the ages. Modern living is too superficial and hedonistic to bring the peace and happiness so much desired by everyone; there is need for a quick and complete return to virtue.
In treating the subjects chosen for discussion we will attempt to present materials and develop points of view that will be helpful in righteous living. 410 Our concern will be more with the present and the future than with the past, and our approach will be more analytic and synthetic than dogmatic. In other words, our aim is practical rather than theoretical. We are anxious to present a series of helps to better living that will be understood and will find application in the lives of Latter-day Saints. For this reason our emphasis will be upon immediate social situations rather than remote philosophical abstractions. The first year's lesson series will deal largely with ethical principles; and the second year's with areas of application, but there will be overlapping of these phases all the way through, and an_ ever-present attempt to see principles side by side with applications in real life situations. Lesson titles for the first year are as follows: 1. Morality in Our Day Lesson Aim: To set the stage for what is to follow throughout the course by examining some of the important trends, problems, and concepts in the field of modern social ethics. 2. Men Are That They Might Have Joy Lesson Aim: To develop the thought that happiness is the goal of all human endeavor, the inner quest of the soul; and that the greatest happiness is the greatest good. 3. The Road to Righteousness Lesson Aim: To expand on the idea of happiness through personal achievement, and to show, thereby, that the road to righteousness involves intelligent and progressive living. 4. Freedom and Responsibility Lesson Aim: To show that freedom and responsibility are inseparably connected, that consequences follow acts; and that individuals are therefore morally responsible for their acts. 5. Truth and Its Perversions Lesson Aim: To examine truth as the framework of ethics, and to study some of the ways in which it becomes perverted. 6. Honesty, The Core of Character Lesson Aim: To analyze the ethical aspects of character, and to show that honesty is at the heart or core of it all. 7. Brotherhood. The Greatness Lesson Aim: To show that greatness is dependent upon bigness of soul; that virtue in its highest sense requires the submergence of self to the welfare of others. Key to Class leaders will do well to read as widely on these subjects as time permits. 'The references listed at the end of each lesson are intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive, and it would be advisable, where possible, to supplement this reading with other sources found in home or local libraries. Standard Latter-day Saint works, together with other Church books and periodicals will prove most helpful. Reader's guides and card indices in libraries should also reveal ample supplementary material under such headings as "morality," "ethics," "social ethics," "Christian ethics," et cetera. The dictionary should be used frequently, and encyclopedias will prove valuable as well. It is realized that some of the listed references will not be available to all class leaders, but a careful searching of sources that are available should bring to light more than LESSON DEPARTMENT enough material to make the lessons both interesting and beneficial. It is to be understood that the lessons themselves are to form the groundwork or nucleus for all discussion. References listed with these lessons, though not endorsed in their entirety, can provide supplementary material that will prove stimulating, and they should be used for this purpose, but though used they should always be sifted and slanted toward the Latter-day Saint point of view. 41) to be held down by these suggestions. Adapt your discussions to the needs and interests of your group. Do not expect complete agreement on every point, but welcome friendly clashes in opinion as stimulants in the cross-fertilization of ideas leading to growth and character development, Some of us need to be shaken out of the moral complacency and stereotyped standards into which we have slipped, and well-directed lively discussions can help us re-think and revitalize our lives in line with righteous and progressive living. That is our hope in offering these lessons. Use the problems given at the end of each lesson as it seems desirable and advisable to do so, but try not Lesson I?Morality in Our Day For Tuesday, October 24, 1944 Lesson Aim: To set the stage for what is to follow throughout the course by examining some of the important trends, problems, and concepts in the field of modern social WE live in an age of complexity, speed, and confusion such as the world has never before known. Ideas clash with ideas, faith yields to skepticism, and everything bows to change. In the cross currents of opinion and expression so common today, many become bewildered, frustrated, and lost; sucked in by the mad whirl around them, many are left floundering for something to hold to that is solid and fundamental. The moral codes of yester- ~ day, many of them, are uprooted from their established moorings and their ties still dangle for want of anchorage in modern life. The tempo of social change and the complexity of social structure both add to the confusion, and in it all one is led to exclaim as Aristophanes did many centuries 4g0, "Whirl is King." The message of this and other lessons to follow is one of optimism and hope growing out of the understanding, courage, and struggle intrinsic in anything really worth while. The pictures presented will not all be pretty but they will be real, and they can be made pleasant if mankind will but put forth the effort necessary to change the situations. Much of the confusion and despair in the world today results from man's inclination to desert the ethics. - 412 great moral principles of the ages. We cannot solve these problems of human suffering by shutting our eyes to them, by running away from reality, by being ostrich-like and hiding our heads in the sand. Neither, of course, can we alleviate man's misery by simply looking at it and brooding. But we must look before we can intelligently act; we must see where we are before we can start building for something better. It is in the spirit of realistically understanding where we are so that we can build for a better world that we turn now to glimpse some of the unpleasing aspects of human relationships. The Question of Social Progress. We hear a lot these days about the achievements of man and the glories of our civilization, but when we observe the inhumanity, injustice, misery, and despair around us, we may well wonder if our achievements are fundamental and if man is really civilized. Technologically we have come a long way, no one will deny that. The electric light, the automobile, the telephone, the radio, and myriads of other inventions, too numerous to mention, have brought us comforts and conveniences undreamed of a few generations ago. In the material and mechanical world the common man now has what kings and queens were denied throughout the ages. But is man any happier now than formerly, and is he any more humane in his treatment of others? Unemployment, poverty, crime, divorce, suicide, war in its most total and brutal forms, these and many other indices of social decay so characteristic of our age lead us to at least question the thesis of social progress. If the advancement of humanity is to be measured in terms of material invention alone, then progress we have; but if happiness and kindness are the criteria of human advancement, the question of progress remains a question. It is in the realms of the social, the moral, and the spiritual that man has climbed the least and suffered the most. This tendency for change in the social and less tangible aspects of culture to drag and remain far behind innovations or changes in material culture the sociologist has called a cultural lag. It is well recognized by students in social science today that such lags do exist, and that personal and social dislocations result. Whenever two or more interrelated phases of life change in different directions or at unequal speeds, the balance of normal relationships is jarred and disequilibriums and tensions inevitably result. 'Today, we have an abundance of machines, enough for everyone to enjoy a decent and comfortable standard of living, but either we use them for war and destruction, it seems, or we allow them to bring unemployment and poverty to the millions. Man is not master of the machine, and until he learns to adapt this Frankenstein of his own creation to his total welfare and happiness, it will remain his master. There are primarily three ways of meeting the problem: (1) One, known as primitivism, is to run away from civilization in search of peace and contentment through isolation, on some far-off island or in some remote region where one can be alone. It is based upon the belief that civilization itself is to blame for unhappiness LESSON DEPARTMENT and that an escape from it all, or a return to nature, will bring the happiness desired. 'This idea sometimes finds expression in perverted ways such as with nudist colonies and other cultist societies, but even when not perverted it fails to solve the problem, for the world is too small to isolate everyone. (2) A second method of meeting, or attempting to meet, the problem of the cultural lag is to declare a moratorium on technological development until society is able to catch up. There are those who believe that we should hold back mechanical inventions until we learn how to properly deal with those we now have. But this, too, is impractical, if not impossible, for how can one stay the creative urge of man, and why should anyone try to stifle human progress? (3) The third and only remaining alternative is to give increased attention and effort to the social and moral fields so that progress here will parallel that of the material field. This is the positive and progressive approach, and it smacks of neither escapism nor defeatism. The great challenges of the day lie in the fields of non-material culture, and if man learns how to meet and handle them even approximating the efficiency with which he has his material culture, then truly can it be said that society is progressing. Some Ethical Implications of War Modern war with its "Pearl Harbors," its indiscriminate bombings, its booby traps, its gestapo, its reprisals, its concentration camps, and its sadistic bloodletting is something horrible to behold. There are some of us who had hoped, though scarcely dared believe, that the 413 world had been made safe for democracy and decency. But now, with everything that we hold sacred or decent being violated, we are forced to shift our hopes into the future. Perhaps some day the world will be advanced enough and moral enough to follow Christ when he said, "Love thy neighbor as thyself," but not yet. Total war, as we call it today, is no respecter of persons, institutions, property, nor principles; and moral structure, along with bricks and mortar, crumbles by its impact. It is unfortunate but true that war almost universally means a letdown in righteous living. People are unnerved by the excitement, the strains, and the tensions inevitable in such a conflict. Emotionalism is increased and judgment becomes more unreasoned and impetuous. There comes a revival of the old philosophy, "Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we may die"; and in the spirit of a "'last fling" many run wild. The separation of the sexes made necessary in army life creates abnormal tensions and morbid attitudes which too often result in mistakes and sorrow. The young man in uniform is separated from the primary group controls of those he loves, and is exposed to the vicissitudes of life under the artificial and sometimes corrupt influence of a male society. The young woman left at home finds opportunity for male companionship more difficult, and in the spirit of desperation frequently lowers her standards in order to compete. Then, too, the very philosophy of war unfortunately makes some feel that the man in uniform is entitled to everything his appetite desires, and that the young 414 woman is more patriotic when she caters to his appetites. Add to all of this the "money madness" that takes hold of so many civilians in wartime, and the reckless abandon with which they shape their lives. It is no wonder, then, that war sees increases in juvenile delinquency, venereal disease, divorce, and in other patterns of social and moral decay, for in wartime, morals often take a holiday. So great were the repercussions of World War I on the moral standards of the day, that the decade following that war is often spoken of as the "wild Twenties." Because of the habits in immorality becoming established today, the hates engendered by the conflict, and the inevitable difficulties in personal and social readjustments following the war, we can expect a similar, perhaps even greater, moral problem after World War II. To recognize this is not to be pessimistic, but only realistic. Potentially the future holds before us both obstacles and opportunities; actually, the future is what we make it. World War II is not fostering moral progress to be sure, but neither does it preclude progress. Unless we are awake to human values and moral problems as we fight, it is entirely possible that we will find ourselves exhausted and defeated socially though victorious militaristically. It all de-, pends on us and on what we do today. The Meaning of Morals We have used the terms morality and ethics a number of times already, and we will have occasion to use them again many times throughout this series of lessons. Perhaps it would be well to see what they and other related concepts mean. Man has always been inclined to adopt standards of right and wrong and to judge his fellowmen in the light of these standards. 'This attempt to evaluate and control human behavior in the light of what is conceived to be good or bad, is known as the field of morality. Chastity is one important phase of morality, but, unfortunately, it is sometimes confused with the term itself, Morality in its broad and complete meaning relates to anything that is conceived to be either good or bad, and morals are simply standards _ of right living. The philosophy or the logical thought system that deals with morality is called ethics, and, for all practical purposes, the two terms may be considered as synonymous. When the system of ethical evaluation is tied up with the pleasure or displeasure of deity, we usually speak of the conformer as righteous and the non-conformer as evil, sinful, or wicked. When, however, the offense is related to society only and not to a supernatural power we speak in terms of vice, crime, et cetera. The good life is the life that pleases both God and man, and conscience is the inward judge and control device that makes the good life possible. The fact that moral or ethical standards are not always uniform need detain us here but little and disturb us not at all. The details of ethical patterns differ widely in both time and place, but there are certain broad fundamentals, just the same, that seem to be both universal and eternal. The mores, as the socially determined, detailed moral codes are LESSON DEPARTMENT scientifically called, are relative to the social groups that practice them, but over and above these there are certain broad moral principles that have stood the test of all time and may therefore be regarded as absolute. Among these are brotherhood, tolerance, honesty, responsibility, effort, and temperance. Neither the customs of the past nor the laws of the present are alone sufficient as guides to moral living. In a changing, dynamic society such as ours, new situations arise daily, and a person must think in order to act wisely and well. But he must think straight and with a courage and a desire to act in the light of the right as he sees it. There is too much wishful thinking today, motivated by the desires of the heart rather than the discipline of the head. And there is too little courage based upon a desire for righteousness. Sometimes people fail to think and other times though they think they fail to act. What we need is a morality that goes all the way; one that is based upon intelligence and faith rather than ignorance and fear, and one that is impelled by an inward passion for righteous living. The crying need of this age is for a widening and a deepening of the moral horizons. 'There are too many today who have grown callous and insensitive to the finer values of life, and indifferent to the consequences of their thoughtless acts. Blunted by indulgence and dissipation, and blinded by the confusion around them they blunder along. Moral skepticism is at the bottom of much of man's suffering. If we are successful in removing any of this skepticism and thereby stimulating a renewed interest and 415 faith in established ethical principles, we will have contributed to the happiness of mankind; and our efforts in preparing these lessons will have been amply rewarded. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Give evidence that society today is more complex, more changing, and more confused than in other times. What is the difference between realism and_pessimism? Why is the one necessary to virtue while the other is a perversion of virtue? Discuss. In discussing the question of social progress decide whether you think the world is getting better or worse in total, and give your reasons. What is a cultural lag? Why does a lag in social, moral, and spiritual development create serious social dislocations? Discuss and evaluate various methods of meeting this problem of the cultural lag. 2, Examine the history of war for the light it may throw on the question of social progress. Is modern war any more humane than earlier wars? Any less destructive? Discuss. What effect does war have upon sexual morality? Upon brotherhood, honesty, and other phases of moral conduct? Analyze the problem of marriage in wartime indicating both causes and consequences. What will be the nature of our moral problem in the postwar era and what do you think can be done about it now? 3. Define and distinguish the following terms: ethics, morals, chastity, righteousness, evil, sin, vice, crime, the good life, conscience, et cetera. Are moral standards relative or absolute? Why or why not? 4. Why are customs and laws alone insufficient as moral guides? Discuss the need of both thought and prayer in the building of conscience. Why is control by intelligence and faith better than by ignorance and fear? Do you agree that the crying need of the age is for a revival of moral consciousness? Discuss.

Most food waste occurs not in pounds, bushels or acre lots, but in ounces, bits, and driblets. The food one civilian wastes in a week will provide food for one military field ration, or feed one Army man for one day. Think what one hundred and thirty million times that quantity could do.
