map of the United States is published for use in connection with the new theology course on Leland N. Peterson ~ 1939 EDITORIAL ?~92 NO. 7 Appropriate DURING the summer months Relief Society activities are Some what limited. This allows time for us to pause and consider the many blessings and opportunities the Society affords us. At this time we might also meditate with profit upon the character and greatness of Relief Society, and review our Own activities in relation to this organization. Relief Society was organized "under the Priesthood after a pattern of the Priesthood," not only for "the relief of the poor, but for the accomplishment of every good and noble work." Inspiration has guided its destiny, and intrinsic worth has characterized its activities. Its program has contributed to the joy and advancement of tens of thousands of Latter-day Saint women, and its benevolent administrations have called forth the gratitude of countless numbers of persons. When an organization has such a birth, such a history, and such worthy purposes, care must constantly be exercised to maintain its activities on a high plane, reflecting the spirit and dignity of the organization. Sometimes, however, because of lack of experience within the Society with its accompanying lack of understanding and appreciation, Ot because of a desire to catch interest by Page 386 Relief Society Programs bringing something new and different into the Society, activities are conducted which are not in harmony with the character of Relief Society. This is particularly true in regard to social and recreational activities. Programs in which women, in an effort to amuse and entertain, bedeck themselves in extreme Costumes, which are ugly and sometimes even offensive, are not in keeping with the dignity of Relief Society. When programs require men, it ig more appropriate to use men than to have women impersonate them. It is unbecoming in Relief Society gatherings to burlesque things for which we should have respect or reverence. Coarse humor and vulgarity have no place in Relief Society. Relief Society programs and entertainments need not necessarily be somber and formal; under certain circumstances, light highly entertaining programs may be given with propriety. They should, however, always be more than inane time wasters which contribute nothing to the enjoyment or advancement of Relief Society women. All activities of Relief Society should be worthy of the time of Latter-day Saint women and should reflect the ideals and standards of out great and worthy organization. ?B. SS. VOL. 31 JULY 1944
