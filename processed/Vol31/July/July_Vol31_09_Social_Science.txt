social science lessons are presented, slightly exceeded in attendance the third meeting of the month devoted to study of literature. This was true in the wards, but in the missions the attendance at the literature meeting was second to that of theology. The home topic, recommended for optional use in the second meeting of the month, was reported used in one-half of these meetings?in 8,944 of the total of 17,441 work-and-business meetings held. However, these topics were provided by the General Board for only eight months or two-thirds of the total meetings held, and it would therefore appear that about three-fourths of the local Relief Societies used this optional topic during the eight winter months?a decline from 1942 when the reports indicated their use during the winter months in almost all ward Relief Societies. A statement on page 387 of this issue of the Magazine announces discontinuation of these topics for the future; and suggests a variety of educational and cultural features which might be planned by the local Societies themselves to be conducted simultaneously with the sewing program, the major activity of this meeting. As in 1942, the 1943 report indicates that only about half of the local Relief Societies have meetings on Tuesday, the traditional Relief Society meeting day. Because of 375 transportation problems incident to the war, many local Societies have found it expedient to meet prior to or in connection with Sunday School, or simultaneously with some other ward meetings. Relief Society Membership As of the end of 1943, there were 103,909 members enrolled in Relief Society. 'This count represented a further decline from the peak year of 1941, but the loss?3,373 or 3 per cent?was much less than during 1942 when 8,000 or 7 per cent fewer members were enrolled. The membership decrease in both years is attributed principally to the unusual population shifts throughout the country, occasioned by war employment and other war conditions, and the resulting lack of affiliation with the Relief Society by members in their new, and often temporary, locations. In both years, also, many Relief Societies cleared their rolls of names of women who joined the Society during the preceding four-year membership campaign for 100,000 members, some of whom were not genuinely interested. In view of these conditions, the greatly lessened rate of decline in membership is heartening, as is the fact that many employed women and others unable to attend meetings value and retain their membership. Actually, there were 12,500 admittances to membership in 1943?more than in 1942? indicating continued recruitment of new members and affiliation with the Society in new localities by the majority of members who had moved. Removals and resignations accounted for 14,781 separations from membership, and death, for 376 1,092. It is also encouraging that the membership decline was little more than 3,000 in view of the fact that the reports indicate nearly 6,000 fewer families known to Relief Society in the various wards and branches. The decreased count of families is another indication of population shifts incident to war, and the attendant lack of affiliation with organized branches of the Church in new localities. A geographic distribution of the 103,909 members among the 2,235 local Relief Societies appears on page 382. This table shows the number of local Relief Societies and number of Relief Society members in the United States and in 21 other countries. For countries in Continental Europe, from which no reports have been available since the onset of war, the latest available figures, those for 1938, are used. This table shows that in the United States there are one or more Relief Societies in every state (except New Hampshire), in the District of Columbia, and in the territories of Alaska and Hawaii. The New England Mission recently reported (April issue of Magazine, p. 232) the organization during 1943 of a Relief Society at Concord, New Hampshire, completing the list of states with organized branches, but no report was received from this new Society for 1943. More than half the members of the Society are concentrated in Utah, in approximately one-fourth of the local Relief Societies. Another distribution of members ?according to assignments in the Society?appears on page 379. As is usual, approximately half (51,728) of the total membership is assigned to serve in one or more Capacities in the organization as officers, class leaders, special workers, or visiting teachers. In addition, many of those not classified as holding one of these positions serve on various committees in local. Societies. From this same table it is gratifying to note that the number of members subscribing for Theadvanced from 53 per cent in 1942 to 64 per cent in 1943. All groups of officers and the general membership shared in the subscription increase. Detailed information on the growth of Magazine subscriptions, a major accomplishment during 1943, appeared in the June issue of the Magazine, Pages 315 to 345. Visiting Teaching The effect of war conditions is also reflected in the Society's visiting teaching program. The 1943 report indicates slight but continued decreases in the number of visiting teachers' districts, the number of women serving as visiting teachers, the number of visits made, and the number of families found at home. There were 28,897 visiting teachers at the end of 1943, but nearly 4,000 additional teachers are needed in order for each of the 16,316 districts to be supplied with the traditional number of two visiting teachers each. Visits made totaled 1,180,887; and two-thirds of the families visited were found at home, indicating that on the average 7 visits per family were attempted, on 5 of which families were found at home, as compared with the expected 12 monthly visits per year. The decline was ANNUAL REPORT?1943 partly due to gasoline rationing and increased employment of women. To help with these conditions, the General Board, early in 1942, recommended that sub-districts might be formed with one teacher visiting alone a fewer number of families in her immediate neighborhood. Where distance made even this plan impracticable, communications by mail or telephone in lieu of visits, were urged. 'These communications in lieu of visits increased by 10,000 to 27,682 in 1943, but not sufficiently to offset the decline of more than 15,000 in number of visits attempted. The drop in number of actual visits was not so precipitous as in 1942, when 75,000 fewer visits were attempted. Nevertheless, it is a matter of concern that go,516 fewer visits were attempted in 1943 than in 1941, immediately preceding the war. The average monthly number of families making contributions to the Society through the visiting teachers increased by nearly 3,000 to 41,777, but, even so, constituted barely one-fourth of the total families of the Church. The ratio would of course be higher if computed on the basis of number of different families contributing once or more during the year. Contributions received by the visiting teachers during the year aggregated $126,321.49, of which $74,064.80 went into the charity fund, and $52,256.69 into the general fund. Compassionate Services It is not possible to measure fully the extent of compassionate service given by Relief Society women in their communities. Only a few of o77 the many ways in which they administer to those in sorrow or distress can be satisfactorily counted, such as visits to the sick and homebound, days' care of the sick, preparation of bodies for burial, and assistance in connection with funerals, but these few items serve to: give some idea of the kind and extent of these services. All of these types of services declined in extent from 1942 except paid care of the sick which increased by 238 days or 35 per cent to 925 days. Altogether, a total of 14,416 days' care of the sick was reported, the majority of which, 13,491 days, was volunteer service by Relief Society women. It is hoped that the slight decrease of 667 days' care of the sick indicates less need for this service. 'The increase in paid care doubtless reflects the greater unavailability of women for volunteer service due to wartime employment, and greater utilization of the Society's charity funds for paid care for those unable to meet this expense themselves. The number of visits to the sick and homebound totaled 108,571, a decrease of 7,435 or more than 6 per cent from the previous year. This drop may likewise reflect less need for the service or greater unavailability of women to make the visits, or both. The preparation of bodies for burial, a unique service among women's organizations, declined. Slightly to 870 during 1943. The number of instances in which complete preparation was provided, where services of a mortician were not available, almost doubled from 252 in 1942 to 435 in 1943 or 73 per cent. This is attributed chiefly to a more complete report of this service. On the 378 other hand, a decrease of 31 per cent was noted in the number of bodies with which the Relief Society assisted only with respect to the dressing, which dropped from 630 to 435. Assistance in connection with funerals, such as decorating the chapel, arranging floral offerings, and giving any needed service to bereaved families, decreased from 4,315 to 4,045 or 6 per cent. Funds Expended Total disbursements of local, stake, and mission Relief Societies and the General Board during 1943 aggregated $440,602.32, a decline of $21,739.79 or 5 per cent from disbursements of 1942. Of this amount $92,185.88 was spent for charitable purposes, and $348,416.44 for general operating expenses and the Society's educational work. The charitable disbursements represented an increase Over 1942 of $4,303.56 or 5 per cent which may be attributed principally to authorization by the General Board of the use of Relief Society charity funds for the purchase of materials for the 1943 quilt assignment for the Church Welfare Plan. Also partly accounting for this increase was the procurement of supplies for ward first-aid kits, also authorized to be purchased from the charity fund. On the other hand, disbursements for general purposes declined by $26,043.35 or 7 percent to $348,416.44. The charity disbursements, in addition to the purposes indicated, went for direct relief to needy families, payments for health work, and other Relief Society welfare projects. In addition, commodities with an estimated value of $3,900.07 contributed to the Relief Society, including donations in kind received by visiting teachers, were distributed to the needy, bringing total charity disbursements to $96,085.95 and total expenditures to $444,502.39. Total net assets of the Society as of the end of 1943, including cash on hand, wheat trust funds, war bonds and other invested funds, value of real estate and buildings, furniture and other property, were reported to be $1,315,630.25. Conclusion Space limitations preclude inclusion in this report of the many interesting accounts of Relief Society activities received in narrative reports from stakes and missions, but many of these will appear in future issues of the Magazine as "Notes from the Field." A comment from the narrative report of Rexburg Stake provides an appropriate conclusion to the foregoing summary of accomplishments, and an indication of the spirit of Relief Society women throughout the Church: "The mere recounting of events can never bring to the reader's mind the time, labor and devotion put into the work of the Relief Societies by the loyal and faithful women of its organization. We are deeply grateful, as a board, that we have been privileged to assist our sisters in this noble work and we face the difficult future with a firm faith in the success of the Relief Society cause."
