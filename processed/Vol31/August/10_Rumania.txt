Rumania Dr. Leland Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah [This is the fourth in a series of articles by Dr. Creer on the historical backgrounds of some of the European countries involved in the present war. ] PART I RUMANIA, whose history began as a Roman colony, was formed within Turkey in Europe by the union of the Danubian principalities, Moldavia and Wallachia, in 1861. Independence - was proclaimed, in 1877, during the Russo-Turkish War, and confirmed by the Treaty of Berlin (1878.) As a result of World War I, the area of Rumania was more than doubled. From Austria-Hungary she acquired Transylvania, Bukovina, most of the Banat of Temesvar, and from her ally Russia, her former province of Bessarabia. The latter cession was not recognized by England until 1922, by France until 1924, by Italy until 1927, and even by Russia until 1933. At its largest extent, the area of Rumania was 113,864 square miles and its population (1937) was 19,525,269. Included in her population were 1,500,000 Transylvanian Magyars; 1,000,000 _?_ Bessarabian Ukrainians; 750,000 Germans; 750,000 Jews; and 250,000 Bulgarians. Despite the fact that the Rumanian government, in 1919, signed a minority treaty, there have been continued complaints concerning her maltreatment and repeated injustices directed toward her subordinate peoples. The minority question remains today one of Rumania's great unsolved problems. With the Nazi occupation of the country, King Carol was forced to re-cede to Russia the rich province of Bessatabia and northern Bukovina; to Bulgaria, the province of Dobrudja; and to Hungary, the northern part of 'Transylvania?in all, an area of some 38,000 square miles. The most important physiographical feature of Rumania is the Danube River, which, for 300 miles, constitutes its southern boundary; and then, for an additional 200 miles, flows exclusively through Rumanian territory until it empties into the Black Sea. The second great river, the Dniester, forms the northeastern boundary. The Carpathian Mountains extend from north to south in the middle of the country and form, at the border of Transylvania, a juncture with the Transylvanian Alps which then extend westward for some two hundred miles. Control of the Danube River as an artery of commerce, and its inclusion of the entire northwestern shore of the Black Sea as a part of its area, makes Rumania the most strategically located of any of the Balkan countries. It is bounded on the north by the U. S. S. R., Czechoslovakia and Poland; on the east by the Ukraine (U. S. S. R.) and the Black Sea; on the south by Bulgaria (separated by the Danube River); and on the west by Yugoslavia and Hungary. Page  YUGOSLAVIA  WALLACHIA 4 BULGARIA UKRAINE! As Bucharest. Drawing by Evan Jensen RUMANIA The soil of Rumania is fertile and, for this reason, agriculture and stock raising constitute the industries of more than eighty per cent of the population. The total tilled land (1935) amounted to 34,249,326 acres or forty-four and seven-tenths per cent of the entire surface of the country. 'The most important agricultural products are wheat, rye, barley, oats, and corn. Vineyards are plentiful. The country yields salt, iron, copper, petroleum, natural gas, and zinc. In fact, except for Russia, Rumania produces more wheat and petroleum products than any other country in Europe. The ministry of agriculture (1935) estimates the value of Rumanian forests (18,100,- 000 acres) at $347,422,000; the value of arable lands (34,249,326 acres) at $412,464,000; and the value of livestock at $496,000,000. Of all the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula, the Rumanians have remained the most independent and the least effected by foreign influences. A Latin people, surrounded by Slavs and Magyars, they were never really absorbed, like the Serbs, Bulgars, and Greeks, into the Ottoman Empire. About the year 101 A. D., the Emperor Trajan organized the province of Dacia in the RUMANIA trans-Danubian area, and a province of the Roman Empire it remained until the close of the third century. About the year 271 A. D., the Roman legions were withdrawn, and the colonists, in order to avoid the barbarian inroads, fled into the Carpathians. For the next thousand years Dacia was merely a highway for successive hosts of barbarian invaders. But they came and went, and none of them, except the Slavs, left any permanent impress upon land or people. As the barbarian flood subsided, the Daco-Roumans emerged from their mountain fastness, and, towards the close of the thirteenth century, established the Principality of Wallachia, and, a century later, that of Moldavia. The former was reduced to vassaldom by the Turks in 1412, the latter in 1512; but neither principality ever wholly lost the sense or the symbols of independence. Both paid tribute to the sultan, but down to the eighteenth century they continued to elect their own rulers. "TOWARDS the close of the sixteenth century there occurred a brilliant interlude which led, for a brief time at least, to the complete realization of unity and independence by the two principalities. In the year 1593, Michael the Brave became Voyvode of Wallachia. He inaugurated his brief but brilliant reign by flinging down a challenge to the Ottomans. The latter, then engaged in their prolonged contest with the Hapsburg emperors, quickly realized the importance of Michael's defection, and turned aside from the Hungarian campaign to inflict upon their revolted vassal 437 what was expected to be a deserved crushing defeat. But Michael's forces, though hopelessly outnumbered, won at Kalougareni a decisive victory over the Ottoman army under Sinan Pasha (August 13, 1595). Strengthened by _ reinforcements from Transylvania and Moldavia, the victor pursued his advantage with such effect as to drive the Turks in headlong route across the Danube. At a single stroke the independence of Wallachia was temporarily achieved. Victorious over the Turks, Michael then turned to the higher task of reuniting under one crown the whole Rumanian people. On October 28, 1599, in the battle of Schellenburg, he inflicted a crushing defeat upon a rival claimant and established himself as Voyvode of 'Transylvania. He next turned his attention to Moldavia, which he soon reduced to submission. Thus for a brief space of time, the whole Rumanian people of the three provinces of Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia were united under Michael the Brave. In 1601, however, this temporary union was dissolved by the assassination of the popular "Latin hero" and_ for more than two hundred years thereafter, because of his untimely death, all hopes of unity or independence among the Daco-Roumans subsided. The fortunes of the principalities reached their lowest ebb in the eighteenth century. Suleiman the Magnificent had, in 1536, concluded an arrangement by which election of the ruling princes was left to the principalities themselves. But in 1711 even this remnant of independence was extinguished. The hospodarships of the two principalities at this time were sold at auction by the Porte and, for 110 years thereafter (1711-1821), 438 Moldavia and Wallachia were ruled by a rapid succession of Greek bureaucrats. The more rapid the succession the better for the Turks. Consequently, each hospodar, knowing that his tenure would be brief (in 110 years there were thirty-seven hospodars in Wallachia and thirty-three in Moldavia), had perforce to make hay while the sun shone, and the system was, as M. Xenopol has said, neither more nor less than "organized brigandage." Meanwhile, the prospects of Rumania suffered from the weakening of Ottoman power and the disintegration of the Turkish Empire. By the Treaty of Carlowitz (1699), the Turks were compelled to cede to the Hapsburgs the whole of Hungary, except the Banat of Temesvar, together with the Rumanian Duchy of Transylvania. By the Treaty of Passorowitz (1718) the recovery of Hungary was completed by the cession of the Banat of Temesvar, while at the same time the Hapsburgs acquired the whole of the territory known as Little Wallachia, that is the portion of the principality bounded by the river Aluta. The latter acquisition proved to be only temporary, for the 'Turks recovered it by the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739. In 1775, however, the Hapsburgs claimed and obtained from the Turks the Bukovina. The incensed Moldavians energetically protested to the Porte against the cession of a district which was not merely an integral part of the principality but "contained their ancient capital, the mausoleum of their kings, and other historical monuments and associations." (Marriott, The Eastern Question, p. 289.) But the pleas of the Moldavians fell upon deaf ears. Meanwhile, the Russians, beginning with the ambitious Peter the Great, began to concern themselves with the Danubian principalities. The Russian interest was not ethnographical, but partly geographical and partly ecclesiastical. Especially after Russia displaced the Turks as the major Black Sea power in the latter part of the eighteenth century, did the location of the provinces suggest to Russian strategists questions of the highest significance. It was not surprising, therefore, that by the Treaty of Kutschuk-Kainardjii (1774), reaffirmed by the Treaty of Jassy (1792), which ended Russo-Turkish wars, the Russians demanded and obtained the right of protectorate over Moldavia and Wallachia, even though the principalities were restored to the Porte. A Russian consulate, against the wishes of the sultan, was established at Bucharest, and Russian agents dispatched throughout the principalities. Clearly the policy of peaceful penetration had begun. These concessions wrested from the Porte coincided with the successful expansion of Russia southward to the shores of the Black Sea at the expense of the Turks. Henceforth, Russia, not Turkey, was to dominate the great inland sea, and, by assuming the role of protector of Greek Orthodox Christians within the Turkish Empire?a right guaranteed by the aforementioned Treaty of Kutschuk Kainardjii (1774), she was also accorded the excuse for subsequent interference in Balkan affairs. During the Napoleonic Wars (1796-1815), Moldavia and Wallachia were regarded merely as a RUMANIA pawn in the game of diplomacy and of war. 'Thus in 1802, the Porte, in temporary alliance with Russia against France, found it necessary to placate the Czar by allowing him the privilege of controlling the appointment and tenure of the hospodars of these states, whose term of office was henceforth to be limited to seven years. When, also in 1806, Napoleon compelled the sultan to declare war upon Russia, the latter responded by -invading the principalities. In 1807, Napoleon decided upon a new move in the diplomatic game and agreed at Tilsit to divide the world with Czar Alexander. The Czar's share was to include the Danubian principalities. But the Tilsit provisions were never carried out and, instead, in 1812, the Czar, in order to render secure his left flank, through the Treaty of Bucharest agreed to evacuate the principalities in return for the cession from the Porte of the important province of Bessarabia. And says Marriott:. The Treaty of Bucharest was, for the Turks, a colossal blunder; to Moldavia, it involved a painful sacrifice. Nor did it tend to assuage the bitter memory which the period of Russian occupation had implanted in the minds of the Rumanians. Though the Russians had come as "liberators" there is no period in the history of their country to which the Rumanians look back with greater bitterness. More particularly do they resent the fact that by the dismemberment of Moldavia a population which now (1918) numbers two million Rumanians exchanged autonomy under the Sultan for absorption in the Empire of the Czar. (Marriott, The Eastern Question, pp. 291-292) With the outbreak of the War of Greek Independence (1821), the custom of choosing only Greek 439 hospodars for Moldavia and Wallachia was discontinued. Henceforth, these officials were to be selected from among the native Rumanian nobility. To the Rumanians, however, this change brought little advantage. It signified only a transference from one alien master to another, for from 1822 to the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, as a result of the Convention of Akerman, the Russians enjoyed a virtual protectorate over the principalities. "The hospodars were to be elected henceforth for a term of seven years by the native boyards, and were not to be deposed by the Sultan without previous notice to Russia." The important Treaty of Adrianople (1829), provided for the complete evacuation of Moldavia and Wallachia by the Turks and conferred upon them practical autonomy. In 1834, the Russians formally terminated their regime of occupation in the provinces. However, this did not end their interference in Rumanian affairs. In fact, so bitter did the anti-Russian feeling become that, in 1848, the inhabitants of the principalities appealed to their nominal sovereign, the sultan, "to deliver them from their liberators," and raised, though unsuccessfully, the standard of national insurrection. Then came the Crimean War in 1854, and with it the decisive defeat of Russia by the Allies?France, England, Sardinia, and Turkey. Peace was concluded at Paris in 1856. The treaty provided for the strict neutralization of the Black Sea and the dismantling of all military arsenals on its shores; free navigation of the Danube River; the abolition of the Russian protectorate over 440 Moldavia and Wallachia and _ the special right to protect Christians within the Turkish Empire; and the cession of southern Bessarabia to Moldavia. At the Congress of Berlin (1878), Russia recovered southem Bessarabia, but was forced to cede Dobrudja, to the south, to Rumania in return, By thus freeing them from Russian domination, the Treaty of Paris enabled the Rumanians in the two quasi-independent principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia to realize their long-cherished dream of a united national existence. At first the Powers of Europe sought to thwart the ambition of the Rumanian nation, and, at a congress in 1858, resolved to prevent the unification of the two states. Especially were the Austrians adamant. Francis Joseph feared that any departure from his long established policy of Divide et Impira, such as the Rumamian project would represent, would lead to dangerous nationalistic repercussions within his own polyglot empire?particularly among the Rumanians of Transylvania and the Bukovina. The Austrian position was supported by England and Turkey. Over this issue, the diplomatic situation became so grave that it appeared almost certain that war would be renewed in the Near East. But the threatened crisis was averted. This was due partly to the desire of Emperor Napoleon III of France to avoid any break with the English Court; partly to the reluctance of Russia and England to revive a war in the turbulent and highly dangerous Balkan area; partly to England's pre-occupation with the Sepoy mutiny in India; but, above all, to the adroitness and tenacity of the principalities themselves. Undaunted at the opposition of the Powers, the separate representatives of both principalities meeting simultaneously at Jassy in Moldavia and at Buchar?st in Wallachia voted "to favor the union of the Principalities in a single neutral and autonomous state, subject to the suzerainity of the Sultan, and under the hereditary and constitutional government of a foreign prince." Then two years later (1859), similar assemblies elected as their prince, the same man, one Colonel Alexander Couza. This flagrant defiance of the will of Europe caused considerable commotion in the chancellories; but the Powers eventually had the good sense to accept the accomplished fact; and on December 23, 1861, the union of the principalities was formally proclaimed. The newly created state was christened Rumania, and Bucharest in Wallachia was named the capital. Sixteen years later, in 1877, the Rumanians proclaimed their national independence from Turkey. This was confirmed a year later by the signatory powers at the Congress of Berlin. (To be concluded) Womans Sphere Ramona W. Cannon N behalf of the Minute Women of Utah, Mrs. John T. Wahl.

Also, by request, she explained the Utah system to a regional convention of salvage workers in New York City?all men, by the way. She has been invited to address similar gatherings in the South and the Middle West. The name Minute Women is original with the Utah group, and their method of organizing and working, says Mrs. Wahlquist, is borrowed from the Relief Society visiting teacher system. Mrs. L. A.

All American paper mills have been closing one or two days a week, except the one in Denver which has remained open daily because of Utah's supply. Paper salvage is important because the chemical required to process newly made paper is needed for armament, and old paper can be reprocessed without that chemical.
