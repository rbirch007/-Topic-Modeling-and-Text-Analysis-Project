literature class leader in the Belvedere Ward, where she held the interest of the women and won their regard for her excellent lesson presentation, and where for five years she maintained an unbroken attendance record even though during this period she had young children, one of whom was an infant.
Mrs. Layton has not only been a devoted Relief Society worker, but she has served with distinction in the Sunday School, Primary, and Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. As Gleaner Girl leader and later as president of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association of Belvedere Ward, she established a close personal relationship with the girls and gave valued direction to their lives. The fruits of these years of service are still evident in that the friendships established have persisted, and many of the girls, even though now women with homes of their own, still seek her for counsel.
Mrs. Layton came from a Latter-day Saint home. Her parents, William R. and Margaret A. Gedge, have always been active in Church work. Mrs. Gedge's musical knowledge and discriminating musical taste, together with her directing ability, have developed choruses and choirs that have delighted Church congregations. For several years she was the president of the ward choir of Relief Society Singing Mothers. The Gedge children, Rachel and Leone, were early taught to love and live the Gospel. Mrs. Layton displays with pride a ribbon rosette awarded her in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, when she was two years of age, for being the youngest member of the Salt Lake Stake Sunday School. Page 423 424 Throughout the years her testimony has grown strong. She is a student of Church doctrine and has an intelligent understanding of the beliefs of the Church. Her testimony asserts itself in an absolute acceptance of Church counsel and teachings. Together with her husband, Lynn C. Layton, counselor in the Ivins Ward bishopric, she maintains an exemplary Latter-day Saint home. Her three children?Robert, now in the service of his country, William, in high school, and Gary, age eight?have been carefully taught the principles of the Gospel. It is a practice in the Layton home for family members to study the Scriptures together. The children are continually guided to square their conduct with Church standards and to have Gospel principles motivate their lives. The Layton home is a religious one, but this does not mean that it is a somber or a pious one. On the contrary, it is an unusually lively, happy home, where family members enjoy a fine companionship and where the doors are generously opened to their many friends. Mrs. Layton received her scholastic training in the Salt Lake public schools and the University of Utah. Prior to her marriage she taught school in the Granite School District. She is an avid and discriminating reader, and has been quick to avail herself of educational opportunities. This training and experience have been put to profitable use in her Relief Society work, particularly in developing class leaders. She has the insight to readily recognize potential teaching ability and the capability to develop it. Among the successful class leaders of her stake are many who credit her with giving them confidence in themselves as teachers and of guiding them to success. Mrs. Layton has an attractive personality. She is alert and analytical. Her bearing is dignified and reserved, yet she is very approachable. She is generous to a fault and extremely appreciative of acts of kindness shown to her. She has true humility; that is, an honest recognition of her own limitations and strengths, and an earnest and sincere desire to learn, to improve herself, and to serve. Her friendships are far-reaching and enduring, and her love for Relief Society work cannot be questioned. She says of Relief Society: "In Relief Society I find satisfaction and friends. These things g0 deep. To be understood in all one's faults and imperfections and still to be liked, kindles a fire within one that warms the heart. I am grateful to my Heavenly Father for my Relief Society membership." Relief Society women will find in the new General Board member a devoted and qualified leader, one whom they will love and respect.
