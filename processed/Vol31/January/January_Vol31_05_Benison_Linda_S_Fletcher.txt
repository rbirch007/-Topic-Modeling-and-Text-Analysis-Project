Se Page 13 CHRISTIE LUND COLES BEATRICE KNOWLTON EKMAN First Prize In Simes of War Christie Lund Coles What Shall the Poet Sing What shall the Poet Say in these dark days ith war's fierce shuttle straining at the loom Of life and hope, entangling the old ways Our feet have gone as in a well-known toom; What shall the Poet say, how can he sing With beauty like a torn and broken lute, here can he find tranquillity to bring Heart to the muse that lies disparaged, mute? Page 14 PRIZE-WINNING POEMS O Poet sing, sing as you've sung before Of meadow larks above sun-burnished wheat; Of summer rain, of stars, of trees that bore Fruit after wind and drouth and frost and sleet; For always man shall come again to these? The good, the common ancient verities! Mothers of Men What lullabies now can a mother make Who sang of quiet slumber, peaceful dreams? When in her heart she feels the gnawing ache ~ Of fear and pity, thinking of the screams Of soldiers dying?boys who yesteryear Were children such as these upon her knee, Who watches anxiously lest she shall hear War's thunder shattering her tranquility? Mothers of men, you must not cease to sing, You must not fail to tell of love and peace, For boys and men need for remembering These moments when their faith first found release; And in the end, your love shall conquer wrong, Your lullabies outlive man's marching song! What Dreams Remain What dreams remain for children, small, to dream, Children familiar with the words of war And hate, with every dreaded scheme The darkest minds can conjure up to mar Simplicity and love and honest trust In the future of the world and in mankind, What is there they can hope against the lust, The wrong their innocence must surely find? Yet, strange as it may sound, a child still knows The same, sweet dreams of childhood; we need not Admonish him to good, for goodness grows Within him like a flower strongly wrought. And someday yet a child shall lead us on To the kingdom that His world is built upon.  Second Prize Night Shadows Beatrice Knowlton Ekman Night, and a cricket singing in the grass, Under a moonlit cloud a plane rides high, Along the lonely lane faint footfalls pass, Twin nighthawks circle swiftly and skim by. Over the terrace old boughs interlace, The leaves cast eerie patterns on your hair, Watching the dark moon-shadows mask your face I lean a little nearer to your chair. I could hear the sound of the sea all night when you had gone? Waves pouring endlessly, to break, to be withdrawn. Across the sand and shale fog moved along the shore, _ The foghorn's warning wail mingled with ocean roar. I stared out into the night and the night stared back at me There was not a star in sight?only fog rolled in from the sea. It is twilight when I come through the lane And lonely of heart turn to our door; The flagstone paths have been washed with rain And fallen leaves litter the garden floor, Wind rustles in late September grasses And over the terrace more leaves spill, Here where your step no longer passes The peering shadows lie long and still. Third Prize (Benison Linda S. Fletcher O You, who stunned, awoke to see a path Of light ascending from the jungle's gloom And left your body in a leafy tomb To tread the shining shaft from realms of wrath; Or You, who shed your shell in ocean's womb After the flaming oil's releasing bath, To find, as compensating aftermath, A place of rest, woven on Light's bright loom; Or yet again, O mounting Eaglet, You, Who felt the arrow cleave the clasping clod Yet still flew on, through and beyond the blue, While downward sped the clay to kindred sod? You all have learned there is no death for you, But just an open door to peace?and God.
