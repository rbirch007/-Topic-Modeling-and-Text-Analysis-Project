TO A NEW HOUSE Etta A. Christensen Little New House, Your portals white Stand as sentinels Throughout the night, To guard and keep you, Little New House. Gay Little House, Years will come and go With cargoes of dreams And bright hopes to bestow On you, and yours, Gay Little House. Glad Little House, Children's joyous calls, And laughter, and song, Ring through your halls. Is your joy complete, Glad Little House? Sad Little House, Your fledglings have flown. Have they taken the gladness To nests of their own, And left you so drear, Sad Little House? Dear Little House, You are growing old. But the wealth of memories, Youth gave you to hold, Shall live on forever, Dear Little House. Sixty Years Ago. Excerpts from the Woman?s Exponents, Jan 1, and Jan. 15, 1884. ?The rights of the Women of Zion, and the Rights of The Women of all Nations.? Editorial Notes: The holiday number of the Contributor contains some very interesting articles. Elder George Reynold's papers upon the Book of Mormon, are calculated to educate our young people in the Book of Mormon literature. Miss Kate Field will deliver her popular and interesting lecture, entitled "An Evening With Dickens," in the Social Hall, in this city, on Monday evening, January 7th, for the benefit of the Deseret Hospital .... The lecture is for a benevolent purpose and should be well attended on that account, as this is the season to bless and succor the poor a unfortunate, and at the beginning of a new year it is fitting to be kindly and generous. The Widow 's Mite: The subject of the Log an Temple is ever a pleasing Saints.... There is a class of donors to which I wish to draw attention .... that of a number of widows, both in and out of the district of our acquaintance, who have donated $2,108.23, which is truly the widow's mite. ? C. O. Card. A beautiful lamp shade cover is made of garnet satin ribbon, torchon lace and small plush balls .... Run the lace neatly on the edge of the ribbon and sew together. Shirr the ribbon three-quarters of an inch from the upper edge, leaving the shirr string long enough to tie underneath. Fasten the balls on the lace, and embroider all the solid parts of the lace with embroidery-silk corresponding in color with the ribbon used. Editorial ? Suffrage in Utah: The clause in Senator Edmunds' bill, abolishing woman suffrage in Utah, is calling forth denunciation and severe criticism, and will bring down upon his devoted head the indignatio n of all good suffragists. Women in Politics: Dr. W. Hammond has failed to produce any physiological reasoning why women should not exercise the right of franchise, and become educated pertaining to the laws and politics of the nation. Now, as we belong to that unfortunate class whose brain is deficient in weight, we should like to ask the learned philosopher whether the superior intellect consists in the quantity or quality. This learned anatomist further asserts that the governing power of the world is to be found in the brain of the male. Where shall we go to find a precedent, not in our own dear native land of liberty, but back to the old monarchial governments of Europe. We learn from history that queens have often excelled kings in the administration of civil government, not from a superior power of reason or intellect, but from a clearer moral sense of justice. ?

Yet, even without war, can our world be happy if people are morally unsound? According to J. Edgar Hoover, delinquency among girls under twenty-one years of age increased eighty-nine and five-tenths per cent during the first six months of 1943 as against the same period of 1942. What are mothers and other adult women doing about this problem? Do they sense their responsibility to the young?the necessity of setting them the right example, of impressing them with a sense of true values, of improving home conditions, of insisting upon kindly discipline? In this connection, it is interesting to note that with the large pre-war Japanese and Chinese population in Los Angeles, that city rarely had a Japanese child in its courts, or even caught in trouble, and a young Chinese delinquent was practically unknown. THE noted writer, Mrs. Adela Rogers St. John, recently lost a son overseas. He was a volunteer in the Royal Canadian Air Force. SALT LAKE'S Louise Isgreen is a successful Red Cross recreational director among convalescing soldiers in a Seattle hospital. She says the work is inspiring because of the courage and spirit of the wounded boys. "Actually, it is they who help 'er, us to face life bravely," she comments. INDIA'S women are emerging into a broader life. In London, in prewar days, numbers of them, in their graceful raiment, passed through the streets to attend classes at the university. In India, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, poet, Mrs. Ranjit Pandit, president of the All-India Women's Association, and Begum Nawaz are working to improve woman's status. The greatest humanitarian work among them has been done by a self sacrificing American, Dr. Ida Scudder, who, for nearly forty years, has brought medical services to the women of India, particularly at the time of their confinements. In 1936, the All-India Obstetrical and Gynecological Congress elected Dr. Scudder president, despite bitter prejudice against making women leaders of men.

Page 29 VOL. 31 O-5 EDITORIAL ~o JANUARY 1944 honour Shy Sather and Thy Mother" S "the earth rolls upon her wings," a new year approaches and another span of time is given each one on which to write a record of spiritual progression or retrogression. If one would inscribe a record which will bring him ever nearer to an eternity of joy, there are certain fundamental laws which must be obeyed. After Moses had led the children of Israel out of bondage, the Lord gave to them ten laws by which they were to order their lives. Amid the thunderings and lightnings of Mt. Sinai, the Lord spoke: "
