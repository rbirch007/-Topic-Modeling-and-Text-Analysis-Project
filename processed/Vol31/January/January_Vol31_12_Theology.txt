Theology Articles of Faith Lesson 23?Submission to Secular Authority Tuesday, April 4, 1944 Article 12: "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. Lesson Aim: To show that ecclesiastical leaders have always given due respect to constituted civil authorities, and to establish the fact that it is the continuing will of the Lord that we do so now. CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 23, TALMAGE'S ARTICLES OF FAITH Introductory Religion, to be of service and worthy of acceptance, must be of wholesome influence in the individual lives and temporal affairs of its adherents. Among other virtues the Church in its teachings should impress the duty of a law-abiding course; and the people should show forth the effect of such precepts in their probity as citizens of the nation and the community of which they are a part. Obedience to Authority Enjoined By Scripture During the patriarchal period, when the head of the family possessed virtually the power of judge Page 46 and king over his household, the authority of the ruler and the rights of the family were respected. 'The filial submission of Isaac to the will of his father, even to the extent of readiness to yield his life (see Gen. 22:1-10) on the altar of sacrifice, is evidence of the sanctity with which the authority of the family ruler was regarded. In the days of the exodus, when the people of Israel were ruled by a theocracy, the Lord gave divers laws and commandments for the government of the nation; among them we read: "Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people" (Ex. 22:28). Judges were appointed by divine direction. It is LESSON DEPARTMENT significant that the judges were so highly regarded as to be called gods, to which fact Jesus referred when threatened with stoning because He had said He was the Son of God. When the people wearied of God's direct administration and clamored for a king, Jehovah yielded to their desire and gave the new ruler authority by a holy anointing (see I Sam. 8:6-7, 22; 9:15-16; 10:1). David, even though he had been anointed to succeed Saul as king recognized the sanctity of the king's person, and bitterly reproached himself because on one occasion he had mutilated the robe of the monarch. Examples Set by Christ and His Apostles At the instigation of certain wicked Pharisees, a treacherous plot was laid to make Christ appear as an offender against the ruling powers. They sought to catch Him by the question?"What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?" His rejoinder was an unequivocal endorsement of submission to the laws. "Shew me the tribute money", He said; "And they brought unto him a penny. And he said unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matt. 22:15-21; Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-25). Throughout the tragic circumstances of His trial and condemnation, Christ maintained a submissive demeanor even toward the chief priests and council who were plotting His death. When He stood be- 47 fore Caiaphas, laden with insult and accused by false witnesses, He maintained a dignified silence. To the high priest's question, "Answereth thou nothing?" He deigned no reply. Then the high priest added: "I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God" (Matt. 26: 57-64; Mark 14:55-62). To this solemn adjuration, spoken with official authority, the Savior gave an immediate answer, thus acknowledging the office of the high priest, however unworthy the man. A somewhat analogous mark of respect for the high priest's office was shown by Paul while a prisoner before the ecclesiastical tribunal. His remarks displeased the high priest, who gave immediate command to those who stood near Paul to smite him on the mouth. This angered the apostle, and he cried out: "God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people" (Acts 23:1-5). Teachings of the Apostles and Book of Mormon Teachings That the apostles and prophets of both Nephitic and Hebraic peoples taught that governmental authority was to be respected, is affirmed by Holy Writ (Rom. 13:1-7; Eph. 5: 22-23; 6:1-9; Alma 1:14). Latter-day Revelation Latter-day revelation requires of the saints in the present dispensation strict allegiance to the civil laws. In a communication dated August 1, 1831, the Lord said to the Church: "Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land. Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right it is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet" (Doctrine and Covenants 58: 21-22). If the people by submitting themselves to the laws of the land be prevented from doing the work appointed them of God, they are not to be held accountable for the failure to act under the higher law (Doctrine and Covenants 124:49-50). Incorporated in the Doctrine and Covenants is an official declaration issued by the Prophet Joseph Smith concerning the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its relation to civil power and the respect due to the laws of the land. This section which is known as Section 134 was adopted by vote of the Church as one of the accepted guides in faith, doctrine, and practice.

Outside Activities A very important phase of teaching and one which offers positive educational value is for the teacher to encourage and direct study and other activities outside the classroom, a report of which will enrich the lesson and add to an understanding of the subject under discussion. The following questions, which will require research outside of the textbook, may be used for this purpose. These questions may be given as a general or as individual assignments, well in advance of the lesson presentation, and time should be allowed for brief reports on the questions at the close of the lesson: 1. Relate incidents recorded in Church history which show that the Latter-day Saints, even in the midst of unlawful persecution, sought redress only by lawful means. 2. Give examples from the Bible wherein severe punishment was meted out for failure to observe recognized law. 3. Cite examples from Scripture in which the Lord granted the people a king to tule over them. Explain why He allowed this form of government to be established. Class members should be urged to bring to class copies of the standard works of the Church. The class leader should provide opportunity for class members to make use of these books.  LESSON DEPARTMENT 49 SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, edition 1938, pp. 49-50. Obedience to Governments Necessary All regularly organized well established governments have certain laws by which, more or less, the innocent are protected and the guilty punished. The fact admitted, that certain laws are good, equitable and just, ought to be binding upon the individual who admits this, and lead him to observe in the strictest manner an obedience to those laws. These laws when violated, or broken by the individual, must, in justice, convict his mind with a double force, if possible, of the extent and magnitude of his crime; because he could have no plea of ignorance to produce; and his act of transgression was openly committed against light and knowledge. But the individual who may be ignorant and imperceptibly transgresses or violates laws, though the voice of the country requires that he should suffer, yet he will never feel that remorse of conscience that the other will, and that keen, cutting reflection will never rise in his breast that otherwise would, had he done the deed, or committed the offense in full conviction that he was breaking the law of his country, and haying previously acknowledged the same to be just. It is not our intention by these remarks, to attempt to place the law of man on a parallel with the law of heaven; because we do not consider that it is formed in the same wisdom and propriety; neither do we consider that it is sufficient in itself to bestow anything on man in comparison with the law of heaven, even should it promise it. The laws of men may guarantee to a people protection in the honorable pursuits of this life, and the temporal happiness arising from a protection against unjust insults and injuries; and when this is said, all is said, that can be in truth, of the power, extent, and influence of the laws of men, exclusive of the law of God. ??Visiting Teachers
