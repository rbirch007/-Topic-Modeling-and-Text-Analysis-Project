Sketch of My Life Eliza R. Snow Smith Chapter IV HAD it not been for the rich seasons of refreshing from above which we experienced from [time] to time, with renewing influence; it really seemed as though many must have yielded beneath the weight of fatigue and exposure; who were thus enabled to struggle through.
But with all that was so kindly and timely bestowed, deaths made occasional inroads in our traveling camps. Nursing the sick in tents and wagons, was a laborious service; but the patient faithfulness with which it was performed, is, no doubt, registered in the archives above as an unfading memento of brotherly and sisterly love.
The burial of the dead by the wayside was a sad office, and so sad, that had it not been for a genuine feeling of sympathy for the bereaved, I would not have witnessed its performance.
On the 4th of August, we met several of the 'Mormon Battalion' ?husbands and sons of women in our Division; and to see the careworn faces of those women, beaming with the glow of exquisite joy in a happy reunion, after a long, toilsome separation, imparted unspeakable pleasure to us all.
On the 17th, a letter brought by brethren returning to Winter Quarters for their families, was publicly read, confirming the cheering report of the first arrivals, to wit: the Pioneers have found a location in Great Salt Lake Valley?a City site was being surveyed, etc. etc., which prompted a feeling that we had a definite point before us?a future peaceful home.
On the 8th, we met the main body of the Pioneers, led by President B. Young and H. C. Kimball, who were returning to Winter Quarters to spend the winter. It was a joyful time, and so deeply interested and absorbed were all, that no guard was kept, and about forty horses and mules were stolen in the night?some of them were not recovered; which crippled the teams and impeded our progress, for many times, especially in ascending hills, the teams had to be doubled, thus causing much delay. But with all these, and other impediments, we strung along and reached the valley, one company after another, until all had arrived. Our arrival was on the 2nd of October.
Our first winter in the mountains was delightful?the ground froze very little?our coldest weather was three or four days in November, after which, the men plowed and sowed, built houses (huts) etc., during the winter?the temperature truly seemed to have been particularly ordered to meet our very peculiar circumstances. Every labor, such as cultivating the ground, and procuring timber and fuel from the canyons was an experiment?most of us were houseless; and what the result would have been, had that winter been as severe as the succeeding ones, the Lord only knows. The small amount of breadstuff brought over the plains, was dealt out sparingly; and our beef, made of cows and oxen that drew it, was, before they had time to fatten on the dry mountain-grass, very inferior. Those to whom it yielded sufficient fat to grease their griddles, were considered particularly fortunate. But we were happy in the rich blessings of peace, which, in the spirit of brotherly and sisterly union, we mutually enjoyed in our wild mountain home, and what we had, seemed to be multiplied as we carefully and thankfully used it. When the men were toiling in the fields and canyons, the women devoted much time in meeting together?administering to the sick, and in fervent prayer to God for assistance from on high, in behalf of our brethren who labored hard with but little food to sustain them. Some large families detailed a portion of their number, who spent their time in digging the wild "Sego-root," the use of which was taught us by the Indians, of whom we sometimes purchased it, and proved it to be a nutritious, substantial article of food, and not unpalatable. PRESIDENT YOUNG had made arrangements for me to live with his wife, Clara Decker, who accompanied him with the pioneers, and remained in the valley while he returned to Winter-Quarters for the other portion of his family. I found her living in a log-room, about eighteen feet square, which constituted a portion of the East side of our Fort. This hut, like most of those built the first year, was roofed with willows and earth, with very little inclination?the first-comers having adopted the idea that the valley was subject to little, if any rain, and built their roofs nearly flat. We suffered no inconvenience until about the middle of March, when a long storm of snow, sleet, and rain occurred, and, then for several days, the sun did not make its appearance. Mrs. Clara Young happened to be on a visit to her mother,* (who lived outside the Fort) when the storm commenced, and did not return until it subsided. Sally, an Indian girl who had been purchased from a tribe by which she was held captive, was with me. The (Continued on page 351) *See Julia A. Caine, "A Pioneer Homemaker" The, p. 464. Thank You, for Thirteen Thousand New Magazine Subscriptions! Vera White Pohlman General Secretary-Treasurer of Relief Society N August 1943, the General Board of Relief Society appealed for increased Magazine subscriptions in the hope that greater volume would make it possible to continue the subscription rate at $1 per year. Your response was immediate and overwhelming, but truly typical of the spirit of accomplishment and loyalty which characterizes Relief Society women throughout the Church. During the brief interval between issuance of this appeal and the end of the year, thousands upon thousands of new Magazine subscriptions poured into the Magazine office. As a result, Magazine subscriptions were increased from 53,325!4 at the end of 1942 to 66,796% at the end of 1943, an increase of 13,471 Or 25 per cent. Also, as a result, copies of the winter issues were quickly exhausted, as it was impossible to estimate how many orders were on the way and wartime paper restrictions forbade printings in excess of known requitements. Reprints were made repeatedly and as quickly exhausted by the continuing flood of subscriptions. For these reasons, many new and renewal subscriptions were delayed, and many others had to be started with a later issue than was requested. And so our thanks is extended, not only for the subscriptions received, but for the patience and understanding of the many subscribers who were inconvenienced during this period. The extent of the 1943 subscription increase can be realized more fully by glancing at the chart, page 316, which shows growth for the past four years. From this chart it is obvious that more new subscriptions were procured in 1943 than in the preceding three years altogether when 8,931 new subscriptions were recorded as compared with 10,210 during 1943 alone. By the end of 1942 the subscription list was greater by 19,141 or 40 per cent than at the end of 1939. The scanty growth in 1941 and 1942 is doubtless attributable to the fact that unusual activities claimed intensive effort by Relief Society women during that period?1941 marked the final year of the Relief Society membership campaign and 1942 the Relief Society centennial. Last year, 53 per cent of Relief Society members in English-speaking stakes and missions were Magazine subscribers, and this year 69 per cent are subscribers. However, this general rate for 145 stakes and 17 English-speaking missions was exceeded by approximately half the stakes and missions, 11 of them with subscriptions for 100 per cent or more of their members. Only 13 of the 162 stakes and missions failed to increase subscriptions over 1942, but Page  five of these (Emery, North Sanpete, Uintah, North Central States Mission and Northwestern States mission appear in the accompanying table and charts (Pages 320 to 329). INCREASE INSUBSCRIPTIONS DURING FOUR-YEAR PERIOD 1940-1943
Theexperienced significant subscription growth during the four-year period from 1940 to 1943. In 1940, subscriptions reached 50,651, representing an increase of 5,651 subscriptions or 12.57 percent over the previous year of 1939. The following year, 1941, saw continued growth with subscriptions rising to 53,404, an increase of 1,904 subscriptions or 3.55 percent over 1940. This brought the total increase over 1939 to 7,755 subscriptions, representing 17.01 percent growth.
In 1942, subscriptions continued to climb to 56,500, adding 1,176 new subscriptions for a 2.12 percent increase over 1941. The cumulative increase over 1939 reached 8,951 subscriptions, representing 18.74 percent growth over the three-year period.
The most dramatic growth occurred in 1943, when subscriptions surged to 66,780. This represented an increase of 10,210 subscriptions over 1942, a substantial 18.04 percent jump in a single year. The total increase over 1939 reached 19,141 subscriptions, representing 40.17 percent growth over the four-year period.
Note: These figures are from the annual reports and differ slightly from totals for 1942 and 1943 as shown in the Magazine subscription report on page 320 because annual reports and subscription reports were not reconciled for 1942 and because, in a few instances, 1943 figures were necessarily used where annual reports for 1943 were not received in time to be included. THE Pictographs published last year (August) showing status of Magazine subscriptions in relation to members for stakes and English-speaking missions are again reproduced here, Pages 323 to 3209, with the 1943 gains added in red. This chart lists all stakes in alphabetical order, followed by the missions. Opposite the name of each stake and mission is a row of 20 symbols? THIRTEEN THOUSAND NEW MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS each representing 5 per cent of the Relief Society members in the stake or mission. The black symbols represent the proportion of Relief Society members who were Magazine subscribers as of the end of 1942; the red symbols represent the additional proportion of members who became subscribers during 1943; and the light symbols represent the proportion of members who still were not Magazine subscribers by the end of 1943. The decreased rates of the five stakes which failed to maintain or increase subscription rates during 1943 are indicated by another symbol as explained at the top of the chart.. At the end of each row of symbols is a rank number by means of which the corresponding stake or mission may be found in the preceding table, listed in order according to percentage of Magazine subscriptions in relation to members. This table shows for 1943 the number of members, subscriptions, and percentage of subscriptions to members. It also shows comparative ranks for 1943 and 1942, the number of 1942 subscriptions, and the number and percentage of change from 1942. The high-ranking stakes and missions which procured Magazine subscriptions equal to or exceeding 100 per cent of their members head the table with the Australian Mission again in the lead with a new high rate of 139 per cent. Immediately following this highest group of 11 stakes and missions which procured subscriptions in excess of their membership is a group of 49 stakes and missions with 75 per cent or more of their members as subscribers. All of these 60 stakes and missions appear on the accompanying honor 317 roll (pages 330 to 345) together with a list of their respective ward and branch Relief Societies which achieved subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of their members. An additional 78 stakes and 14 missions which, as a whole, did not achieve an honor-roll rating are represented on the honor roll by hundreds of achieving wards and branches. Every English-speaking mission is represented on the honor roll by one or more branches, and 135 of the 145 stakes?all but 10? are represented by one or more wards. The honor roll is arranged in alphabetical order and the name of the Magazine representative appears opposite the name and record of each Relief Society listed. In those instances where no one is appointed as Magazine representative, the name of the president appears. Great credit is due the supervisory stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives, and all of the ward and branch Magazine representatives who have done the arduous work of procuring subscriptions, with the assistance and support of Relief Society officers and members. We express the appreciation of the General Board to these faithful Magazine representatives and to all who assisted them. We also express to these Magazine workers the gratitude ofsubscribers everywhere who are now assured that the subscription price of the Magazine may be maintained at $1 per year because of the outstanding results obtained. S an expression of its appreciation, the General Board is again awarding a free one-year Magazine 318 subscription to all local representatives who procured subscriptions equal to 75 per cent of the ward or branch Relief Society enrollment as of the end of 1943, and is, for the first time, also including stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives in this award. Recipients of this award for 1943 number 848?of which 776 are ward and branch representatives and 72 are supervisory stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives. Only 10 stakes and missions won a place on the 1942 honor roll as compared with 60 for 1943. The number of local Relief Societies appearing on the honor roll more than doubled, increasing from 383 in 1942 to 776 in 1943. It has been the policy heretofore to use only the Magazine subscription report as the source of information for the honor roll. However, three stakes (Juab, Panguitch, and South Summit) and four English-speaking missions (Canadian, East Central, North Central, and Northern California) failed to submit Magazine subscription reports, but reference to the annual Relief Society reports compiled by the secretaries indicated that most of these unreported stakes and missions had local Relief Societies with rates entitling them to a position on the honor roll, and they were therefore included. All subscriptions procured, even those not included in the honor roll, contributed to the tremendous growth in Magazine circulation, without which the nominal subscription rate of $1 could not have been maintained. Furthermore, all subscriptions procured are bringing Relief Society lessons and other organization work, a variety of articles of general reading interest, and high-standard fiction and poetry to nearly 70,000 new and old subscribers. It is interesting to note from the table the shift of stakes from low 1942 rank to high 1943 positions. For example, Bannock Stake rose from 52d place in 1942 to 2d place in 1943, from a percentage rate of 61 per cent to 115 per cent, a gain of 75 per cent in number of subscriptions procured; Shelley Stake advanced from last position to 17th by increasing subscriptions 74 per cent; Highland Stake jumped from 127th position to 25th, increasing its subscriptions by 59 per cent; Mt. Jordan rose from 118th position to 32d with an increase of 67 per cent in subscriptions; and San Fernando Stake went from 115th position to 4oth, increasing its subscriptions by 81 per cent. The greatly increased number of high-ranking stakes and missions and the diminished number of those in lower rank is readily apparent from the following summary of groups in the accompanying table as compared with the previous year's table: Subscription rates 1942 1943 100 per cent and over 2 11 75?100 per cent 8 49 65?75 per cent 27 a6 55?65 per cent 42 35 45-55 per cent 38 2 35??45 per cent 26 9 25?35 per cent 14 1 Under 25 per cent 4 1 Total stakes and missions 161 162 Exceptional rates of increase in number of Magazine subscriptions are also noted for even those stakes which experienced no great shift in THIRTEEN THOUSAND NEW MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS rank from one year to the other, or fell short of a place on the honor roll, but which nevertheless made tremendous gains. For example, the young Western Canadian Mission almost doubled its Magazine subscriptions, winning a place on the honor roll with 3 78 per cent rate for 1943; Cottonwood Stake made the greatest numerical increase in subscriptions in the Church, hoisting its subscriptions from 214 in 1942 to 580 in 1043, an increase of 369 or 175 per cent, but even so fell slightly short of the honor roll without 71 per cent of its members as subscribers; Inglewood Stake increased its subscriptions by 122 per cent, from 227 to 505, but also fell short of the honor roll because of its low position the Previous year; the Central States Mission increased subscriptions from 112 to 285, or 154 per cent; Roosevelt Stake more than doubled subscriptions (115 per cent) by increasing the number from 89 to 191; and Moon Lake Stake made the greatest percentage increase in the Church (201 per cent raising its subscription list from 36 ? to 110. Another year effort by the stakes and missions which have made these tremendous gains should assure them a position on next year's honor roll. The 17 stakes with the greatest numerical increase (200 or more over 1942),
and the 27 stakes and missions with the greatest percentage of increase (50 per cent and more over 1942) are listed separately. Other commendable rates of increase will be rooted by reference to the main table. It is hoped that the impetus and enthusiasm gained during the 1943 Magazine campaign will make the attainment of the honor roll a possibility for even more stakes and missions during 1944, and the removal of all Relief Societies from the low-ranking groups.

STAKES WITH GREATEST NUMERICAL INCREASES (200 and over ) In terms of absolute numerical growth in subscriptions, Cottonwood Stake led with an increase of 595 subscriptions, growing from 859 in 1942 to 1,196 in 1943. Ogden Stake followed with an increase of 346 subscriptions, from 850 to 1,196.

Wells Stake added 205 subscriptions from 772 to 977, and Pasadena Stake increased by 203 from 313 to 516. STAKES AND MISSIONS WITH GREATEST PERCENTAGE INCREASES (50 per cent and over)
Among the stakes and missions showing the most significant percentage growth in subscriptions, Moon Lake Stake led with a remarkable 364% increase, rising from 110 subscriptions in 1942 to 501 in 1943. Cottonwood Stake followed with a 211% increase, growing from 580 to 1,175 subscriptions. Central States Mission achieved a 185% increase, from 245 to 698 subscriptions, while Inglewood Stake showed a 122% increase from 227 to 505 subscriptions. Roosevelt Stake increased by 115% from 191 to 410 subscriptions.
Western Canadian Mission experienced an 88% increase from 38 to 73 subscriptions, while Portland Stake grew by 87% from 256 to 478 subscriptions, and Bannock Stake increased by 86% from 477 to 720 subscriptions. San Fernando Stake showed an 81% increase from 529 to 956 subscriptions, and North Davis Stake grew by 79% from 503 to 772 subscriptions.
