Report on the 114th Annual Conference Elder Antoine R. Ivins Member of the First Council of Seventy 114th annual general conference was convened in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, April 6th, at the usual hour, and under the presidency of President Heber J. Grant, with President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Taking charge.. All of the general authorities of the Church, except President Rufus K. Hardy of the First Council of Seventy, were present as were also the presidents of the missions of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. President Hardy was prevented from attending by serious illness which confined him to the hospital. Features of the first meeting were the reading of a message from President Grant, who refrained from speaking upon the advice of his physician; the reading by President Clark of an extensive financial report which shows that the Church is out of debt; the reading of the report of the auditing committee; and the sustaining of the general authorities among whom was the newly chosen apostle, Mark E. Petersen, who comes to his new position from the managership of The Deseret News and the presidency of Sugar House Stake. His appointment met general approval and all were pleased with his spirit as expressed in his remarks to the conference. While our beloved President was Page 296 ACCORDING to custom, the not allowed by his physician to address the conference, he was able to be present, at least part of the time, in all of the sessions except that of Friday evening; and it was not only pleasing, but thrilling, to the great body of Priesthood present, to hear his testimony and counsel again as it was read to us. May God extend his days so long as life may be sweet to him. His message was a powerful testimony to the Church of the truthfulness of the Gospel and the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He began by expressing his gratitude to the Lord for extending his days and increasing his strength, and told of his joy at being able to meet with the Saints again in general conference. He is now able to work nearly half of each day at his office with the consent of his doctor. He told of the many pleasing memories he has of the people who have assembled in the Tabernacle in past conferences—leaders of the Church from President Young on down, and generations of the Priesthood of Israel, mighty men of God who have passed on. Among _ these many memories was the occasion on which he was so blessed of the Lord that he spoke beyond his natural ability to the conversion of a wayward brother. REPORT ON THE 114TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE He was pleased to see that the testimony of the Holy Ghost abides in the hearts of the sons and daughters of these faithful people, and he sorrows to see any of them turn away. He said, "When I look around and realize how many of those who have been wonderfully blessed of the Lord have fallen by the wayside, it fills me with humility." We should forgive the sinner when he repents. "What the world needs today more than anything else is an implicit faith in God, our Father, and in Jesus Christ, His Son, as the Redeemer of the world. The message of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the world is that God lives, that Jesus Christ is His Son, and that they appeared to the boy Joseph Smith and promised him that he should be an instrument in the hands of the Lord in restoring the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this dispensation. I leave this testimony, as a witness to all the world, and I do it in the name of Him whose work this is, even the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen." From here on, the talks of the brethren covered a wide variety of Gospel themes, all appropriate to the occasion and spirit of the conference. Over all there seemed to hover a spirit of peace and good fellowship, of faith and devotion. The much-beloved hymns of the Church were sung in most of the meetings by the congregation with a gusto, power, and harmony most pleasing, we were told by our radio audience. The Sunday morning session was shared by the regular choir broadcast 297 and the Church of the Air for which Apostle Albert E. Bowen was the speaker. As it was Easter Sunday, he developed the theme, "He Is Risen From The Dead," moving through the ministry of Christ to His crucifixion, burial, and_ resurrection. The fact that Christ, having died, actually lives, should be a source of inspiration to all and especially to the mothers of the fine young soldier boys who are likewise making a vicarious sacrifice for their fellow men. There is great comfort in the realization that they will live on. In this session, President David O. McKay discussed the resurrection of Christ in a convincing manner, the following being a very brief summary of his remarks: He began by quoting Job: "Yet in my flesh shall I see God," and then said, "He who can thus testify of the living Redeemer has his soul anchored in eternal truth." The appearance of the Father and Son to Joseph Smith, Jr. Is the latest and greatest testimony of this. Assurance of life after death is the most precious thing a man can have. The apostles of old received this testimony by actual association with the risen Lord. After the crucifixion they were weak and dismayed until they received this assurance. Having obtained it, their strength was absolute. The resurrection of Christ connotes the fatherhood of God, the immortality of the soul, the brotherhood of man. Living the standards of life as taught by Christ is the true foundation of this testimony "I know that my Redeemer lives," and results in being born again. Acceptance of 298 Christ's teaching results im peace and happiness; rejection, in war and bloodshed. AS is usually the case, the Priesthood meeting, which was held Friday evening, was very generously attended and a good spirit prevailed. President Clark chose this' occasion to deliver his message to the conference. After a few introductory remarks, he quoted from Section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants to show that the word of the Lord is given to the people in the inspired teachings of His servants, and these inspired sayings become Scripture. He then read from the Pearl of Great Price to show that no two spirits are equal any more than are the planets of the universe and, likewise, no. Two of us are equal, but nevertheless the Lord said "if ye are not one ye are not mine." We can be one in purpose. Bishops must support the stake program and stake presidents must sustain the Church program. Without this unity we are not the Lord's people. In referring to the Welfare Work, he called attention to the effort to take the worthy poor of the Church off Government relief, stating that he felt sure the time will come when, for these poor, it will be "the Church or nothing." He cited a case of a mother whose children induced her to transfer her property to them, after which she was placed in a public institution. This is contrary to the recommendation of the Church which feels that those first responsible for the welfare of the poor are the children, in the case of parents, and relatives in other cases, after which the Church will assume the burden. To quote him, "It seems to me, Brethren, that there is a way to lead every child to 'honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.' Brethren, I would rather live in a log hut, surrounded by my children, among my old friends, than to live, torn away from all these, the charity inmate of a state palace." Finally, he stated that he believes that the Constitution of the United States was inspired of God, for the Lord said so, the Prophet said so, and the prophets since Joseph have said so. The Lord in the Constitution itself prescribed the way to change its provisions. It is given to protect minorities and the only way to do this is to require the vote of large majorities before it can be modified. He sees grave danger of loss of our liberties in the tendency of small groups to change its provisions. In this Priesthood meeting President McKay spoke again, this time on the necessity of establishing confidence of children in their parents and in the authorities of the Church, as well as confidence of the members in the Church leaders. There were many other appropriate instructions given in the various talks but limited space prevents analysis of more of them at this time. It may be safely said, as we heard on all sides, that it was a wonderful conference and the people who attended, as well as the radio audience, received additional strength and power to carry on in the work of the Lord. Mark E. Peterson Named Apostle Elder Henry A. Smith Church Editor of the Deseret News AT the turn of the century the humble home of two Danish converts, in Salt Lake City, was blessed with the arrival of a new son. It was a home where the Gospel was lived and appreciated and where the parents taught their children, by precept and example, to evaluate and apply in their lives the principles of this message they had received in a foreign land. This humble father and mother reaped a full and joyous reward a few weeks ago when this son stood before a large audience in the great Tabernacle in Salt Lake City and, while bearing a sweet and humble testimony, expressed his gratitude to them for having taught him to believe this message and for all other things they had done for him. He was Elder Mark Edward Petersen who had been sustained on the previous day, April 6, 1944, by the general conference to fill the vacancy in the Council of the Twelve. With hearts overflowing, Christian and Christine Andersen Petersen sat before the radio in their humble home to hear this honored son pay them grateful tribute. They listened joyfully as he extolled the beauties of the home life that had always been his with them, and with his lovely wife and family. Elder Petersen was born November 7, 1 900, and is one of five children. He has two brothers and two sisters, one of them a twin sister. His wife is Emma Marr McDonald Petersen, an accomplished pianist, and they have two daughters, Marian, seventeen, and Peggy, twelve. Elder Petersen is a young man, energetic and thoroughly capable. He brings to his new responsibilities a r ichness of wisdom and experience beyond his years. He possesses a full share of the qualifications of able leadership. He has demonstrated his faith, loyalty, and devotion to the Church. He is a powerful exponent of the message of (Continued on page 352)
