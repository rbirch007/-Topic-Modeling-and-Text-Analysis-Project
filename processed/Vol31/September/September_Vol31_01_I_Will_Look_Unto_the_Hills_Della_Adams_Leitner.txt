I WILL LOOK UNTO THE HILLS Della Adams Leitner The hills speak to me in their changelessness And in their changing moods of light and shade. At dawn, rose-crowned, with gleaming peaks arrayed With filmy clouds, they give no hint of stress; But when, storm-ridden, dark with gloominess They stand serene and bid me, unafraid, Be brave and strong, patient and undismayed, I gain new power to meet the storm's duress. "Unto the hills I look," the psalmist said, "From them comes help"?and I have found it so; My burdened heart is warmly comforted By what they give, and I have come to know Unchanging is God's promise for He wills "Strength of the hills'"?"the everlasting hills."
