Rumania Dr. Leland Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah PART II [This is the second part of the article on Rumania in the series being written by Dr. Creer on the historical background of some of the European countries involved in the present war. The map of Rumania appeared in the August issue of the Magazine. ] Alexander Couza, directed his energies toward the improvement of the social and economic conditions of his people. Between the years 1862 and 186s, he carried through, despite much opposition especially from the aristocratic feudal party, a series of far-reaching reforms, mainly concerned with education and agrarian interests. He founded two universities, one at Jassy and one at Buchatest; he established a number of secondary and technical schools, all of them free, and made elementary education not only gratuitous but nominally compulsory. Despite Couza's efforts, the percentage of illiteracy in Rumania is still very large; in 1920, it was sixty per cent of all people over seven years. Couza solved the agrarian problem by abolishing feudalism. All dues, both in labor and kind, were rescinded, in return for an indemnity advanced to the lords by the state to be repaid in installments to the latter by the peasants; one-third of the land was turned over to the peasants, leaving the remaining two-thirds in possession of the lords. But these measures did not satisfy the peasantry, and today the agrarian problem remains the most serious of all Rumania's domestic difficulties. During the thirty years immediately preceding the outbreak of World War I, no less than five insurrections occurred among the Rumanian peasantry. Page 488 Meanwhile, a_ revolution headed by the opposition succeeded in deposing Couza, in 1866. Hardly a voice was raised for the unhappy prince. Not a drop of blood was shed in his behalf. "He passed silently out of the land for which he had dared much, and seven years later he died in exile." Couza was succeeded by Prince Carol, the second son of the Prince of Hohenzollern - Sigmaringen, the elder and Catholic branch of the Hohenzollerns at Berlin. The new prince at once directed his attention to reforming the government. A liberal constitution was granted in 1866, and, although considerably amended in 1879 and 1884 and still further during the turbulent Twenties following World War I, it was still basically the constitution in operation in Rumania before the period of German occupation. The document provided for a cabinet of nine members who were responsible to the legislature. The latter is bicameral in form, but both chambers RUMANIA are elective. In each case, however, the election is indirect, the elections being made through electoral colleges, composed of the taxpayers who are divided into three colleges, according to the amount of taxes paid. This, of course, confines the suffrage to the wealthier classes. The Senate consists of 120 members, who must be at least forty years of age and possess an income of 376 pounds a year, and their term of office is for eight years. The Chamber of Deputies consists of 183 members, who are elected for four years and must be at least twenty-five years of age, Despite this quasi democratic form of government described above, the tendency in Rumania, as well as in all the other Balkan states, has been toward autocracy. Perhaps the absence of adequate middle classes and insufficient popular education, together with the continued intrigue of foreign powers which has served as a constant threat to the very existence of the Balkan nationalities themselves, has mitigated against the growth of democratic institutions. As one authority puts it: Each government seemed to acquire a majority of seats with a minority of votes, and sooner or later they all relapsed into some form of dictatorship. Kings and courts and armies came into their own again, and with a minimum of popular opposition. Dictatorships were set up in Yugoslavia in 1929-31, in Bulgaria in 1935, in Greece in 1936, and in Rumania in 1938. (Age of Conflict, P- 353) From a social and economic standpoint, the long reign of Prince Carol (1866-1914) was one of marked improvement and prosperity. A few notable examples will suffice. In. Of World War I. 489 1866, there did not exist a single railway in the state; in 1912, 3690 kilometers had been constructed. The export of cereals in 1866 was less than 500,000 tons; in 1913, it amounted to 1,320,235. Of petroleum, the production in 1866 was 5.915 tons; in 1912, it was 2,000,000. The total state budget in 1866 was 56,000,000 francs; in 1912, it was more than 500,000,000, In the Russo-Turkish War (1877-78), the Rumanian army numbered 40,000; in World War I, it was more than 1,000,000. The external trade of the country, consisting mainly of oil and cereals, in 1912 amounted to more than 50,000,000 francs, and exceeded that of all the other Balkan states together. The interesting point is that most of this foreign trade was with the Central Powers. In 1912, for example, imports from the United Kingdom totaled less than 2,000,000 francs; from Germany and Austria-Hungary they amounted to more than 13,000,000. The analysis of Rumania's foreign trade statistics indicates eloquently enough the orientation of Rumanian foreign policy before the outbreak On more than One occasion, King Carol unmistakably demonstrated his sympathies for the Central Powers?Germany and Austria. This accounts for the secret adherence of Rumania to the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria, and Italy), concluded in 1883 and 1889. The alliance provided, in substance, that if Rumania or Austria were attacked without Provocation on their part by Russia, the two contracting powers would mutually assist one another against the aggressor. Should a third party intervene (notably France), 490 Germany and Italy were obligated to support the contracting powers. 'This new Quadruple Agreement was renewed from time to time. The last renewal took place on February 5, 1913, when the agreement was extended to July 8, 1920, and explains, largely, the neutral position of Rumania during the first two years of World War I (1914-16). Over and against this Rumanian-German solidarity of interests were three important factors which threatened, and finally did succeed, in winning Rumania away from the Triple Alliance into the concert of Allied Powers known as the Triple Entente (England, Russia, and France). These were: (1) the Hungarian-Magyar policy toward Transylvania; (2) the Austrian support of Bulgaria's position against Rumania at the outbreak of the Second Balkan War (1913); and (3) the Russo-Serb wooing to win Rumania away from the Triple Alliance, by suggesting and sponsoring the so-called Balkan League, directed primarily against Turkey. During the Second Balkan War (1913), Rumania became an ally of Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro against Bulgaria and Turkey, both later allies of Germany and Austria. Asa result of this conflict, Rumania added 2,687 square miles of territory in the region known as Dobrudja, with a population of 286,000, entirely at the expense, of course, of Bulgaria. This included the important fortress of Silistria on the Black Sea. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Rumania, officially friendly to Germany, hesitated to enter the war on the side of the Central Powers. True, the coveted districts of Transylvania and Bukovina were in the hands of the Hapsburgs, but the equally coveted province of Bessarabia was held by Russia. 'Then, too, the sympathies of the masses unmistakably were for their Latin neighbors France and Italy. 'The question was: "Could Rumania hope, either by diplomacy or by war, to achieve the complete reunion of the Rumanian people?" This was the coveted goal. The issue was decided largely through the death of King Carol in 1914. With the king's passing, there was eliminated the strongest pro-German force within the kingdom. On August 27, 1916, Rumania, after two years of strict neutrality, declared war upon Austria and Germany. By secret treaty with England, Russia, Italy, and France, she was promised Transylvania from Hungary, Bukovina from Austria, and the Banat of Temesvar from Hungary. But within four months, German armies under Generals Mackensen and Falkenhayn conquered practically all of Rumania and then, on May 27, 1918, forced upon the hapless people the humiliating Treaty of Bucharest. Its terms granted the Central Powers a monopoly of Rumanian grain and oil for a period of thirty years. Hungary secured a frontier along the Carpathians which would secure her from a future Rumanian attack. The ports of Constanta, Giurgiu, and Turnu-Severin, all on the Black Sea and the Danube River, were leased to Germany and Austria-Hungary. 491 The Dobrudja, though claimed by Bulgaria, was allotted to the joint administration of the four allied powers?Germany, Austria - Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Bessarabia, alone, was permitted to join herself to the Rumanian state. Such was the cruel treaty of Bucharest, disastrous to Rumania, destructive of her economic and political independence, deeply humiliating to her pride.
Yet, despite the misfortune of Rumania in 1916, she not only recovered her losses through the postwar treaties of Versailles, Saint Germain, Trianon, and Neuilly, but more than doubled her territorial area by adding Transylvania from Hungary, Bukovina and the Banat of Temesvar from Austria, and Bessarabia from Russia. Thus in 1920, for the first time since the brilliant conquests of Michael the Brave (1593-1601), a Rumanian state which included all Rumanians had been created. However, this great achievement was destined to be short-lived, for, within twenty years, the new state was undone by the second conquest of the Germans who reimposed a second and more onerous Treaty of Bucharest upon the hapless Rumanians in 1939.
THIS twenty-year interim between the First and Second World Wars is extremely complicated, and yet highly important and prophetic of the future of the new Rumania. The following trends of development are noted:
Emphasis was given to political and economic reform. In 1923, King Ferdinand authorized the promulgation of a constitution which abolished the old three-class system of indirect election, and extended the suffrage literally among the masses. Greater attention, too, was given the important question of agrarian reform. About one-half of the arable lands of Rumania was owned before 1916 by a few thousand large proprietors, and this despite the efforts, as we have seen, of Rumania's first sovereign, Alexander Couza (1851-1866.) By the land reforms of 1917, 1918, and 1921, about 5,000,000 acres of nobility-owned land and all the arable lands of the royal, absentee, and foreign owners were confiscated. No farm could exceed 1200 acres in area. Compensation was provided for in fifty-year national bonds at five per cent of the expropriation price. In the newly acquired territories, the large land holdings were reduced to about 250 acres in Bessarabia, 625 acres in Bukovina, and 500 acres in Transylvania. In old Rumania, the average peasant land holding was twelve acres; in Dobrudja, twenty to sixty acres; in Bessarabia, fifteen to twenty acres; in Bukovina, ten acres; and in Transylvania, ten acres. By 1930, these reforms, about ninety per cent of the land was in the hands of peasant proprietors. This program encountered considerable opposition in Transylvania, where the large landowners were Magyars. These, by the Treaty of Trianon, had been accorded the right to choose between Hungarian and Rumanian citizenship. If they elected the former, Rumania was forbidden to confiscate their lands, since they held their property as foreigners. But when the Rumanian government did so, the disappointed Transylvanians appealed to the League of Nations in behalf of their opt. The matter was finally settled by the League Council in January 1930, when the so-called Brocchi plan was adopted. This provided for the reimbursement of the expropriate optants through a fund created by the leading Allied Powers and Hungary. Nevertheless, the animosity between Rumania and Hungary over this question persists to the present day. 492 The political equation in postwar Rumania has been rendered unusually complicated and dangerous _because of the intense rivalry between political factions, and especially because of the strange role played by the former Crown Prince and later King Carol II. The Liberal Party ruled Rumania until 1928 under the leadership of her kings, Carol I (1866-1914) and Ferdinand (1914- 1927), and their ministers, John C. Bratianu and his sons Jon and Vintila. This party, representing largely the business interests of the country and the intelligensia, advocated policies of centralization, national self-sufficiency, government ownership, and control of forests and mines; and opposed vigorously the importation of foreign capital, even when the capital was meant to be employed for the development of national resources. The Conservative Party, on the other hand, representing the land-owning classes, favored the use of foreign capital, a liberal trade policy, and a definite orientation in foreign policy toward the Central Powers?Germany and Austria. In 1926, the Peasant Parties?that of Rumania led by Michalache, and that of Transylvania, by the brilliant Maniu, were fused and succeeded the Liberals in power, in 1928. This party advocated the following compromise program: (1) repeal of the censorship; (2) suppression of anti-Semitism; (3) the attraction of foreign capital to develop the national oil industry; (4) development of railroads and other public works; and (5) the stabilization of the monetary system.: Meanwhile, Crown Prince Carol interjected himself strangely into the imbroglio of Rumanian politics. In December 1925, Carol divorced his wife, Princess Helen of Greece, and went to Paris to live with his mistress, Mme. Magda Lupescu. His mother, Queen Marie, and Premier Bratianu, disapproving of his behavior, had a new succession law enacted, January 4, 1926, which denied the throne to the Crown Prince, made his five-year-old son, Michael, his heir, and provided for a Regency -in the event that King Ferdinand died before his grandson reached maturity. The King died in July 1927, and the boy, Michael, accordingly became king, under a Regency headed by Queen Marie and Premier Bratianu. Now the Nationalist Peasant Party, headed by Maniu and backed by the army, advocated the restoration of Crown Prince Carol, but upon the condition that he should become reconciled to his estranged wife, Helen. Meanwhile, Carol did return to Bucharest, July 8, 1930, had himself proclaimed king, abolished the opposition party in power, refused to become reconciled to Princess Helen, openly courted the favor of the Central Powers, and eventually set aside the constitution and proclaimed himself dictator, in February 1938. But King Carol could not assert his dictatorial powers in the face of Axis opposition. For Hitler, flushed with success, had covetous eyes on Rumania because it was the gateway to the Balkans, and an important granary and oil reserve for continental RUMANIA Europe. Accordingly, in September 1940, he arranged to have Rumania dismembered. Bessarabia was given to Russia; Transylvania to Hungary; and southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria. In addition, the state's important grain and oil reserves were requisitioned to Germany. King Carol was forced to abdicate in favor of his son Michael, who became a German puppet king. One of the encouraging trends in modern Rumania is the enthusiasm noted among political leaders toward the Balkan co-operative movement. This program was initiated first by Stanbulisky of Bulgaria and Stephen Radich, founder of the Croat Peasant Party. Immediately after World War I, Rumania joined the movement. Village school teachers and priests joined with intellectual idealists from the towns to found the Rumanian Peasant Party under the leadership of Julius Maniu, who at once joined with Stahbulisky in founding the Southern Slav Federation. In 1920, the organization emerged into what became known as the Green International, a society neither capitalist nor Marxist, which tried, though unsuccessfully, to create a union of all southeastern peasant parties. After 1930, this initial peasant co-operative movement became a part of the larger program for economic and political Balkan union. In 1932, for instance, there was a joint meeting of the Yugoslav, Bulgarian, and Rumanian agricultural co-operatives under the influence of the Third Balkan Conference. THE first move toward political union was made at Athens in October 1929, when a conference of 493 Balkan states, presided over by ex-premier Alexander Papanastasiou, was held. From the beginning, Papanastasiou became the guiding spirit of the conference movement, and he found considerable support in all the Balkan states for his plea for union among the Balkan peoples ?even including Turkey?on the ground that they had shared "similar or common destinies and vicissitudes; that they had lived for centuries within the same political' framework; and because they had similar habits and ideas and sufficiently common interests." The First Balkan Conference was opened in the Greek Chamber of Deputies on October 5th, 1930, and thereafter, a permanent machinery was set up for the convoking of annual conferences and the interim work of its various committees. Among the concrete achievements of these conferences are listed: (1) the organization of a Balkan Chamber of Commerce and Industry; (2) a Chamber of Agriculture; (3) a Tourist Federation; and (4) a Balkan Federation of Jurists to codify and simplify the law. At the Fourth Conference, at Saloniki, the formation of a Balkan Labor Office was planned and the protection of women in industry was deliberated upon. Through the committee on social policy, appointed at this same conference, both Greek and Turkish delegates worked to initiate the principles of free admission, free circulation, and free. Economic activity for all Balkan nationals on a basis of complete reciprocity. At the Third Conference at Bucharest, Rumania's proposal for a medical 494 union was made the basis for a later. Balkan Medical Federation, one of whose functions was the supervision and development of rural hygiene. The educational value undoubtedly was the major result of the conferences. Through their deliberations the delegates obtained _firsthand knowledge of the leading personalities in all of the six countries and it became customary for them to propose and to provide for the taking of joint action in the solving of their common problems. With regard to foreign relations, Rumania, despite the sympathetic leanings of her kings to the Hohenzollerns, has pursued a policy of the following delineations: (1) Close collaboration with her fellow Balkan states in the interest of territorial security. This accounts for the organizations of the Balkan Pact, including Turkey, Rumania, Greece, and Yugoslavia, in 1934. Bulgaria refused to join, but without rancor. Albania was not even asked to sign on account of her close relation with Italy. (2) The affiliation of Rumania with France and the Little Entente (Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Rumania) in order to guarantee, as far as possible, the sanctity of the postwar treaties of Versailles, Saint Germain, Trianon and Nuilly. This was concluded in 1921. A second agreement with France, in 1926, provided for a strict non-aggression pact and an agreement to submit all disputes to arbitrations. Rumania, in a special protocol of the same year, promised not to provoke a war with Russia, for France had no desire to become involved in a military conflict because of an ally's ageression. (3) Rumania has consistently supported the League of Nations' Program. (4) Despite the rancor of Russia because of the loss of Bessarabia, relations between Russia and Rumania have been strangely friendly. In 1929, for example, Russia induced Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Rumania to adhere to the Litvinov Protocol declaring the provisions of the Briand-Kellogg Pact, outlawing war, to be operative at once. (5) Rumania has pursued a consistent policy of friendship with regard to Poland. The successful role of Rumania as an important power in Europe will depend upon the following factors: (1) the defeat of the Nazi and Fascist aggressors and the liberation of the Balkans from foreign influences; (2) the continued success of the co-operative movement among the Balkans themselves, especially with regard to economic matters; (3) the organization of some kind of program of collective security? through some kind of League of Nations?which will be able to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all small states; (4) the organization of a state based as far as possible upon the principle of nationality, extreme care being taken, however, to accord all minority groups fair treatment and political and economic justice; (5) the proper solution of dynastic difficulties; if King Carol II is to be returned as sovereign, the Rumanians will insist upon democratic government and conventional procedures; and (6) continued friendly relations with Russia, especially since the Bessarabian question appears to be the most rancorous of all Rumanian problems.
