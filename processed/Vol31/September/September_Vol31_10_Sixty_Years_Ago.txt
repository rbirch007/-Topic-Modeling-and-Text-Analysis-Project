On Sunday, August 24th as per previous announcement, memorial services were held in the large Tabernacle in this city at the same time that funeral rites were being performed for the martyred Elders in Paradise and Kanarra, whither the bodies had been taken to the respective homes of the victims of the terrible massacre, that took place August 10th in Tennessee.... At each end of the stand were most exquisite floral emblems. The gates ajar in most lovely white flowers with a real white dove over the top of the gates. The other was a broken column of magnificent white flowers, artistically arranged and symbolizing the broken life in a most effective manner. On the communion table in front of the Bishops who were administering the sacrament a most unique design in florals. A band of purple flowers, on which was wrought the initials of the martyrs in white pansies; in the center was a crystallized white cross, from the four corners rose aloft four date palm branches, gracefully bending and uniting in the center, on which rested a crown of immortelles, Surrounding the base of this Berry and John H, Gibbs, who were slain for the testimony of Jesus Christ, at Condor's Farm, Lewis County, Tennessee, Sunday, August 10, 1884."

M., Ma Smoot passed away from earth. She was born on the 16th of April, 1809, in Chester District, South Carolina. Her father was a revolutionary soldier and her grandfather Hunter was an officer of high rank during the country's struggle for freedom.... On the 11th of Nov., 1838, she was married to A. O, Smoot, while Far West was surrounded and the people made prisoners of war... She was the first President of the 20th Ward Relief Society.... In 1878, when the stake organization was completed she was chosen as Stake President of this (Utah) Stake. With what loving self-sacrifice and womanly dignity she filled this position until her death, only the weeping hearts of the sisters throughout this stake can testify.... Although we miss her, we can but feel a deep, solemn joy that one so nobly worthy has gone to her sure reward.? Homespun [Susa Young Gates] Page 506
