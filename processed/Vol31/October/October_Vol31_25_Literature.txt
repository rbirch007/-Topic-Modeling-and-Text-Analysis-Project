Literature New Testament Lesson 4?Wisdom Literature of the New Testament Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, January 16, 1945 SAYINGS of our Savior are gems of radiant truth. For simplicity, clarity, and strength, for depth of wisdom, they are unsurpassed in all literature. Added to this, many of these sayings, by their natural music and imagery, rise to the rarest in poetic expression.. Where, for example, outside of the New Testament, can one find truth expressed more effectively, more artistically than in these typical sayings of the Master? Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest (Matt. 11:28), Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these (Matt. 6:28-29). Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God (Mark 10:14). Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole (Mark 10:52). Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head (Luke 9:58). Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do (Luke 23:34). For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16). Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more (John 8:11). I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (John 8:12). It is small wonder that with inspired words such as these coming from Jesus, listeners should say, "Never man spake like this man" (John 7:46); or that learned critics of his day should question, "How LESSON DEPARTMENT knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" (John 7:15). Nor should we marvel that, with deference to the Father who had sent him as "a light to the world," the Savior would say with divine assurance, "my words shall not pass away" (Mark 13:31). Truly, no words have been more remembered and treasured. Nor have the sayings of any other man been a more lasting influence for good. These precious sayings, carried in the hearts of those who heard them, recorded by the apostles Matthew and John, and later by Mark and Luke, are an unsurpassed heritage of spiritual literature. In his appraisal of the Master, Dr. Dinsmore says: We think of Jesus as teacher, example, redeemer, but we are not accustomed to consider his marvelous power of literary expression.... In him all fullness dwelt? fullness of the prophetic spirit, fullness of wisdom, fullness of poetic utterance.... Socrates in his last hours reasoned about immortality; Jesus pursued no argument; he simply said, "In my Father's house are many mansions... I go to prepare a place for you." His sentences inevitably fall into the natural cadence of deep emotion. He spoke in metaphors and reasoned in parables. Beyond all this, as every true believer in Christ has felt, there is the touch of divinity in his words that illuminates the mind and quickens the soul. They inspire one to deeds of righteousness. The Savior knew and constantly acknowledged the source of the power that enabled him "to speak with authority and not as the scribes." He could say humbly, yet with certainty, "The words that I speak unto you, they 601 are spirit, and they are life" (John 6:63). No pretense to oratory can be discerned in the messages of the Master. They fell from his lips naturally; yet how directly they went to the mark. Nor did Jesus ever pose as a preacher. Rather he was a great teacher, living the truth he portrayed with words of clarity and power. He taught individuals rather than classes or congregations. True, folk flocked about him, sometimes in multitudes; yet even in the midst of the throng, he was dealing with individual needs. A blind man is restored to sight; a child is lifted up and blessed; a woman touches the hem of his garment and he turns to say, "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole" (Mark 5:34). It was ever a specific message that he gave. Its application was concrete and definite; yet it went to the hearts of all. These vital lessons of life sprang naturally out of human. Situations and human needs. His illustrations, likewise, were drawn from everyday experiences. When Simon Peter and Andrew, fishermen of Galilee, were called, it was, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers. Of men" (Matt. 4:19). When he would impress the vital work of saving those that had gone astray, he spoke of seeking a "lost sheep." When he had asked for a drink from the woman at the well, he impressed a divine lesson with these words, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst" (John 4:14). It is from precious sayings, such as these, taken with their life settings, that the living gospel is portrayed. 602 74 In his "Sermon on the Mount, this message is presented somewhat more fully. Yet this masterful presentation of some of the fundamentals of the gospel was hardly a sermon in the ordinary sense of this term. It does not follow the text and comment construction commonly used by preachers. Rather it is an array of gems of wisdom, filled with divine inspiration, pointing the way of righteousness and encouraging men to follow the path leading to eternal life. In style the "Sermon on the Mount" is somewhat like the Proverbs. Yet it rises to greater brilliance. The Sermon presents a newer, more deeply spiritual message. Something of ringing challenge for our better selves is in such lines as "Ye are the light of the world.... Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven.... Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth... But lay up for yourself treasures in heaven... No man can serve two masters... Ye cannot serve God and Mam-?? Mon The Beatitudes, with which the Sermon is opened, are full of solace, are radiant in their gospel light. What words, for example, carry a more healing touch than these: "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted"? What have more uplift than these: "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God"; "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God"? What words point the way more plainly towards growth in the gospel than these: "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled'? (See III Nephi 12:6). Often the sayings of Jesus become poetic in their cadence and _ their vivid imagery. Their structure is at times like Hebraic parallel verse; for example: Behold the fowls of the air: For they sow not, Neither do they reap, Nor gathereth into barns; Yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Ze & Not every one that saith, "Lord, Lord," Shall enter the kingdom of Heaven: But he that doeth the will of my Father, Which is in heaven. * * * And the rain descended And the floods came, And the winds blew and beat upon that house; And it fell not: For it was founded upon a rock. Another excellent example of thythmically beautiful expression is "The Lord's Prayer." It is this music and beauty of expression, as well as the profound wisdom they carry, that make the sayings of Jesus easy to learn by heart. And this explains, in part, why they have been remembered and treasured through the years. Discussion and Activities 1.
