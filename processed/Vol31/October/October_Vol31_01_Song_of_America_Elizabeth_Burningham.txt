SONG OF AMERICA Elizabeth Burningham America! I sing of these: Incredible cities of awesome heights, Clangorous days and neoned nights, Brine and beach, spindrift, tide, Tipping sail. The spongy glide Of marsh where tules run, Of mountain snow, and valley sun. Dry, clanging color of chasm'd rock In spill: of desert. 'The shock Of a sudden virgin spot. Singing Darkies through down of cotton swinging. Palm and cedar, stretching pine, Field and furrow, farm and vine. Wind and green wave in corn and wheat, Squares of orchard, strict and neat. America! I sing of these: The westward way of pioneers, Step of progress across the years, The pan and the mule, scented sage, Indian's retreating rage; Of derrick and crane and motor roar. Giant snouts of steel that gore Earth for metal. Spike and rail, Sturdy wings through sun and gale. America! I sing of these: Shadowy crosses on a hill; Dust on the rust of guns long still, Gold stars, trees planted in memory, All for the sake of liberty! The washed-in souls from overseas, The weary ones seeking surcease From ragged schemes of rotted lords; Civilizations suave and cruel. The hordes We gulped with hardy insides, We of soft hearts and tender hides. But most of all I sing of these: Of happy children at their play, Peaceful hours at end of day, Birthday cake, geranium on the sill, Sunday supper, picnic on the hill, A prayer at church, laughter on Every street. A new wet lawn. For these are the things that make each part. Stitch. Seam.: Sinew. Heart. That make this land, Land Of The Free, America, I sing of Thee!
