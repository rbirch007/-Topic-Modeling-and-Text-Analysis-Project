THEY ALSO SERVE" Alice Eddy LeCornu They also serve who do the humble things, Who toil and sweat in weariness and pain When honors pass them by, and plaudits wane, For whom no banner waves nor clarion rings? They also serve. They also serve who do the simple things, Who hold the rhythm of a sane routine And keep life balanced, steadfast, and serene, In times of stress, around them solace clings, They also serve. They also serve who do the happy things, Who kindle joys and fan the sparks of fun, Who seeking clouds of war still face God's sun, How sweet above earth-sorrows their faith sings! They also serve.
