WHERE BRAVE MEN KNEEL Eva Willes Wangsgaard There are no atheists where brave men kneel In foxholes or behind low dunes of sand; No anti-Christs, where lonely hunters steal Through fetid jungles, pointed knife in hand. When strong men find their lives are caught between 'Two enemies, the sea and men at war, They reach for greater strength on which to lean And feel a Presence never felt before. And they who cleave the dark on lifted wing, Whose homing hour can never be foreknown, Can hear a Voice above the thundering, And through their loneliness are not alone. So near are they to God, they surmount death, Aware of life, not limited by breath.
