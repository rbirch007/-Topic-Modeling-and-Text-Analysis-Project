YES, I WOULD BE A SAINT My heart is fix'd?I know in whom I trust. "Twas not for wealth?'twas not to gather heaps Of perishable things?'twas not to twine Around my brow, a transitory wreath? A garland deck'd with gems of mortal praise, That I forsook the home of childhood: that I left the lap of ease?the halo rife With friendship's richest, deep, and mellow tones? Affection's fond caresses, and the cup O'erflowing with the sweets of social life, With high refinement's golden pearls enriched. Ah, no! A holier purpose fired my soul? A nobler object prompted my pursuit: Eternal prospects opened to my view, And Hope Celestial in my bosom glow'd. God, who commanded Abraham to leave His native country, and to offer up On the lone altar, where no eye beheld But that which never sleeps, his fav'rite son, Is still the same; and thousands who have made A covenant with Him by sacrifice, Are bearing witness to the sacred truth, Jehovah speaking has reveal'd His will. The proclamation sounded in my ear? It reached my heart?I listen'd to the sound? Counted the cost, and laid my earthly all Upon the altar, and with purpose fix'd Unalterably, while the spirit of Elijah's God within my bosom reigns, Embraced the Everlasting Covenant see ? It is no trifling thing to be a Saint In very deed?to stand upright, nor bow, Nor bend beneath the heavy pressure of Oppressiveness?to stand unscathed amid The bellowing thunders and the raging storm Of persecution, when the hostile powers Of darkness stimulate the hearts of men To warfare?to besiege, assault, and with The heavy thunderbolts of Satan, aim To overthrow the kingdom God has rear'd. To stand unmoved upon the withering tack Of vile apostasy, when men depart From the pure principles of righteousness? Those principles requiring man to live By every word proceeding from the mouth Of God?to stand unwavering, undismay'd And unseduced, when the base hypocrite Whose deeds take hold on hell, whose face is garbed With saintly looks drawn out by sacrilege, From the profession, but assumed and thrown Around him for a mantle, to enclose The black corruption of a putrid heart? To stand on virtue's lofty pinnacle, Clad in the robes of heavenly innocence, Amid that worse than every other blast, The blast that strikes at moral character, With floods of falsehood foaming with abuse? To stand with nerve and sinew firmly steeled, When, in the trying scale of rapid change, Thrown face to face, and side by side to that Foul hearted spirit, blacker than the soul Of midnight's darkest shade, the traitor, the Vile wretch that feeds his sordid selfishness Upon the peace and blood of innocence; The faithless, rotten-hearted wretch, whose tongue Speaks words of trust and fond fidelity, While treachery, like a viper, coils behind The smile that dances in his evil eye? SKETCH OF MY LIFE ordeal, and to have open, all its contents To pass the fiery The heart laid strewed Before the bar of strictest scrutiny; To feel the finest heart-strings drawn unto eir_ utmost tension, and their texture Proved. And yet, although to be a Saint requires A noble sacrifice, an arduous toil, A persevering aim; the great reward Awaiting the grand consummation, will Repay the Price, however costly; and The pathway of the Saint, the safest path ill prove, though Perilous; for 'tis decreed All things that can be shaken, God will shake; Kingdoms and Governments and Institutes, Both civil and religious, must be tried? tried to the core, and sounded to the depth. Off Oppressive fetters?break reins Usurpers hold, and lay the pride of man? ? pride of nations, low in dust! The gorgeous
