LIVING SAFELY AT HOME Nellie O. Parker Former Member of Relief Society General Board Chairman Home Safety Division, Utah Safety Council HOME is quite generally considered the safest place in the world. "Safe at home" is an axiom in everyday usage. But, paradoxically, accidents which occur in the home, cause as many injuries as all other types of accidents combined, and home accidents cause more deaths than any other type of accident. These fatalities and injuries result in an enormous waste of life and limb, a staggering economic loss, and entail sorrow and suffering that never can be measured. They wreck savings and bank accounts; bring in their train poverty, hardship, and discomfort; and increase charity demands. Hospital beds are filled with such sufferers, and the care of nurses is required that is sorely needed for sick and wounded servicemen. According to the National Safety Council, in 1944 there were 30,500 persons killed in home accidents; there were 4,600,000 others injured, with a monetary cost of $550,000,000. Statistics for Utah for the same period show that every second day a home in Utah suffered the tragedy of an accidental death. Every month there were fifteen victims whose lives could have been saved by a little extra foresight, a little extra carefulness, a little extra attention to commonplace dangers in the home. No normal person wants to have an accident. His inborn instinct of self preservation and his desire to carry forward his plans and daily activities are thwarted when one occurs. It is important that every individual, especially a parent, be made conscious of the unsafe conditions that may exist in his home as well as habits of living which may produce accidents. Everyone should feel a personal responsibility to safeguard his life and those of others?especially little children. No little child should lose his life or become maimed or crippled if foresight and attention can prevent it. Little children need constant surveillance to see that they are getting sufficient air to prevent smothering, that they do not fall or get burned, etc. Everyone should learn to recognize a hazard in a loose fixture or frayed electric cord, a faulty furnace flue, or a pan of hot water set too near the edge of the stove; to foresee in a protruding nail, a dark cluttered stairway or an attic full of rubbish, a cause for an injury or a fire. And not only should he recognize the hazard but he should correct it. "Safety," says the National Safety Council, "is a rule for living for every individual, and it must be made a part of every human activity.? Page  Safety is efficiency, it is good housekeeping. It is intehigent to keep things in order, in their proper places and in good repair. It is safe, as well as good housekeeping, to keep grease, water or ice off the floor; to keep brooms, mops, etc., stored away in closets to prevent falls. Oily dustclothes should be kept in closed containers to avoid spontaneous combustion. Inflammable liquids, such as gasoline, should not be used for cleaning. This epitaph might apply to too many: Here lie the remains of Lizzie Green, She cleaned her dress in gasoline. Even though one may have performed a risky act without mishap once, it does not mean that luck will always be with him. It has been proved that an unsafe practice will eventually result in an accident. CHILDREN should be taught safe habits from babyhood?to eat or drink only those things given to them as food; to put their toys away; to climb only when it is safe; to avoid touching electric outlets or extension plugs. Sharp instruments such as knives, scissors, hatchets, etc., should be kept out of reach of children until they are old enough to handle them safely. If children, as well as adults, are trained in habits of safety, they can proceed to their daily activities without the lurking danger of an accident. Poisons should be kept out of reach and not in the bathroom medicine chest. They should also be marked in a distinctive way such as having a pin stuck in the cork. Old medicines should not be thrown into waste baskets where children might get them, nor should similar bottles be kept side by side, especially if one contains cough medicine and the other a benzoit compound for the croup kettle. Hurrying or quick, hasty movements are often the cause of bodily injury or death. If one feels anxiety, emotional stress or illness, the individual is often not as careful or alert to hazards as he normally would be. It is a safe practice, therefore, to avoid undue haste, to try to keep calm under all conditions, and to try to use common sense at all times. To prevent accidents should be a prime objective of everyone, but as human beings are prone to err, it is also important to know the fundamentals of first aid, and to have a working knowledge of home nurs; ing so that life may be saved if an accident does occur. The Accident Prevention course being given by the American Red Cross will prove helpful to the housewife who, because of her position in the home, can best be its safety engineer. It will help her to recognize unsafe conditions as well as unsafe practices in her own home. Strive to live safely at home by being prepared: first, to recognize or anticipate a hazard; second, to repair or eliminate the danger; third, to cultivate and form safe habits; and fourth, to keep a good first-aid kit close at hand.
