Unanswered Prayers Marguerite J. Griffin 

SPUNKY our cat died, but will never be forgotten. The boys accepted the event as something from which there was no appeal, but my little daughter's heart seemed torn with the longing that it might not have been. Perhaps the boys felt these same emotions and only kept them buried. In any event, it was she who a few days later brought her disturbed emotions out into the light to me.
"Mother," she said, "while you took Spunky to the hospital, I went up to my room and prayed three times." There was emphasis upon the numeral. "Doesn't God love cats like he does people?"
There was no humor in the eyes of this little daughter of mine. This was one of the most serious questions she had ever asked me in her eight years. She had been taught to pray. She had been taught to recognize God's blessings. She had believed she need only ask and he would hear and answer her prayer. But this time?this time when she had sought him urgently thrice, he had failed to grant her request. Spunky's life had been taken.
Search your hearts, adults. Has the same question ever gnawed at your peace of mind? Have you ever thought, "It is no use to pray, God may not hear"? Can you recall, now, some of the stories that have come out of this war, of men abandoned on sea or desert, who, motivated by the sharp pangs of physical hunger, have united their voices together in prayer to be saved, sustenance and for food? Can you recall how some of these men, when the answer seemed delayed, ridiculed the idea that there is a God, while others kept their faith and waited in patience until the reward at last came.
Patience comes into a man from an outward source, from a faith in something bigger than himself. The captain who knows his ship well, who has faith in the skill of the company which created it for him, can ride through the stormiest squall in it, secure in the knowledge that it is a good ship and will weather the storm, whereas the humble passenger who is in ignorance of the vessel's quality, who has never before faced a storm at sea, may find his physical body torn and weakened by an overpowering terror that it worse than the raging wind and weather. However, in the landwork of men there is always the possibility of flaws, there is always reasonable doubt. The storm might bring to light a defect in the boat's construction, a weakness in some spot that might mean danger. The captain knows this and places special watches throughout the storm. The crew becomes more vigilant. If an emergency arises?well, it is emergencies that test the mettle of men, be they passengers or captains. And there are some terrors under which the delicate mechanisms that are flesh and blood and nerves break, if they have nothing stronger than themselves to cling to.

He himself could have slept through it unafraid, but when they awakened him, he answered their need. He lives yet to calm the troubled heart. If he quieted the squall, can he not do as much to your fears? Peace, my heart, be still. So I told my little daughter the story of the Man of Galilee who was God's very own Son, and how he prayed so fervently in the Garden of Gethsemane when his soul was "sorrowful even unto death" because of the thing which lay ahead of him to do. Though he was a God, yet he shrank from the pain, from the anguish of the ordeal. "Father," he prayed, "all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt." Three times he offered this same plea, "If it be possible remove this cup." But the prayer was not answered because it was not his Heavenly Father's will, and Christ prayed for his Father's will, not his own, to be done. On our part we often ask for things which are not good for us, or which would deny others. What would have happened had God spared his Son's life? What would have been our state, yours and mine? Sometimes it is hard for man's logic to perceive just why this is so, but the scriptures tell us: "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead; for as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive." According to the great plan, had Christ failed in his mission, death would not "have been swallowed up in victory," and where then, would have been our hope? Divine purposes are not always understood by the human mind, but in the family circle we come nearest to the type of heavenly things. As we are concerned with the welfare of all our children, so our Heavenly Father's work and glory is the salvation of all of us, not just a select one or two. Do we as earthly parents allow our little ones to select, as the only food for their meals, the sweets which, of course, are the most tasty to their tongues? Ask any small youngster what he would like for dinner. He may say, as often as not, "Cookie" or "Ice cream." But no loving parent would grant him that request first. For what would happen? The child would have no appetite left for milk and vegetables, the nourishing elements from which his body must grow. So he sees no cookie on his tray at first, and sometimes he frets about it, but after he has eaten the needful things, then comes the dessert, last of all. So, often, we are like children. We want the sweets of life right now, not realizing that a taste of the bitter first but makes us enjoy the sweetness more. "Be not children in understanding: Howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men." God's ways are not the ways of men, but we can be sure his ways are best. Sometimes I think if we could only see more clearly, if our eyes were envisioned to a time longer than the bounds of our short years, we would discern that even our worries, our troubles, our sufferings, but give us greater strength for future days.
IN October of 1941, so shortly before Pearl Harbor, my husband and I took a trip in our car, traveling through some six of our Western States. This was in the days, you remember, when there was plenty of gasoline and practically no speed limit on the open road. I recall that vacation now with nostalgia, even in spite of the fact that for the first few days we were most sorely vexed with flat tires. What annoyance when our time was so limited and we wished to travel so far! What vexation as, one by one, we discovered that the new tires which had been on the used car we had bought some six months previous were filled with old, patched tubes, or tubes too large for the tires. With the little driving we had done around town we had had no trouble, but now, spinning along the open highway, it was a sequence of purchasing new tubes. This distressed us, too, for we had made a very close budget, and this unexpected expense strained it considerably. We thought fate was harsh with us.
At the moment, nothing seemed worse than the delays and expense, but the events of a restless world moved rapidly, and we saw the outcome of this experience in a very short time. Then it took no special sort of genius to realize how lucky we had been, for we were ready to face the duration with brand new tubes in our tires, whereas otherwise (perhaps I should say by now our car would not have been available for use on the guest emergencies. We've often spoken of this and have been ashamed of our annoyance, yes, our anger even, those first few days of our last traveling vacation. Now I try to remember the lesson of the tires when new problems and worries come upon me, and I tell myself: "If I could just see a little farther, maybe this, too, will be for the best."
Paul said, "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God." I am learning to realize that, too, as experiences come in life. I am learning that the important thing is to love God no matter what happens to us, no matter if he denies is our petition today, no matter if our hearts or our bodies must bleed and suffer, no matter if it would seem that he has forsaken us or is scourging us with many stripes.
Have ye "forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, my son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?" And while a son may be rebuked more bitterly than a servant in the house or a guest, remember that his status and rewards are vastly different. He is heir to all that his father has. "Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits and live? . . . Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: Nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."
But regardless of what we must own, "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job" (and you know how much he had endured) "when he . . . prayed for his friends." Even a child can understand the glory of this.
"I shall pray for my brothers," said my little daughter. They are sorry Spunky's gone, but they don't say anything. They must hurt a lot inside."
Oh, yes, let us pray for each other and for a pain-racked world. Let us pray for our brothers and our neighbors who share our burdens. Let us not even forget our enemies, "for they know not what they do"
or our foe, that has a reward of its own. "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job" (and you know how much he had endured) "when he . . . and mark you well these words . . . when he prayed for his friends." Even a child can understand the glory of this.
"I shall pray for my brothers," said my little daughter. They are sorry Spunky's gone, but they don't say anything. They must hurt a lot inside."
Oh, yes, let us pray for each other and for a pain-racked world. Let us pray for our brothers and our neighbors who share our burdens.
