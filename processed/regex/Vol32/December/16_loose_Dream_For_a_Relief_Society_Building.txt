Dream for a Relief Society Building Counselor Marianne C. Sharp T WOULD ask an interest in your faith and prayers for I feel that words are very inadequate to express the feelings which are in my heart today. I am grateful for the privilege we have as sisters?as mothers always working for the salvation of our children and as Church members striving for the furtherance of the work of the Church?to meet together once more in a Relief Society general conference. I am grateful, personally, for the opportunity I have to work in the Relief Society under Sister Spafford who is true and faithful, and I want to thank my Heavenly Father for this privilege. I love the Relief Society. I love the sisters in the Relief Society and have joy in association with them. Wherever I have lived or visited in the Church I have felt the close bond of love and service which links together the members of the Society today. The members today, however, are only links in a great chain of sisters which reaches back to include the valiant and great women of the past 103 years, and will stretch forward to encompass those yet unborn who will devote their services to working for the good of others, always seeking at the same time to improve themselves. I am thinking particularly this afternoon of those sisters who have gone on before. Ever since Sister Lyman appointed Sister Spafford and me to help prepare the book A Centenary oi Relief Society to commemorate the hundredth birthday of the Society, I have felt very near to the Relief Society leaders of the past and the faithful members who are the mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers, even great-great-grandmothers, of the members today. They have stepped out alive for me from the pages of the Woman's Exponent and from the minutes of the General Board. Their testimonies have increased my testimony. I have shared in their joys and sorrows and, as nearly as one can, I have entered into their desires for the upbuilding of Relief Society. As we studied this history of the past, we read of one great dream which had gone unfulfilled. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 749 It is of this unfulfilled dream I wish to speak today. In order to introduce it, I will take you back forty-nine years ago yesterday to October 3, 1896, to a general Relief Society conference held in the Assembly Hall. Aunt Zina Young was the president of the Relief Society at that time and with her on the stand sat her three counselors, her vice-presidents as they were called, First Counselor Jane S. Richards, Second Counselor Bathsheba W. Smith, and" her third Counselor Sarah M. Kimball. It was near the end of the afternoon session that, according to the minutes taken by Sister Emmeline B. Wells, then secretary: President Zina D. H. Young, in her remarks, opened out upon the subject of a house for the Relief Society, to be owned by them. Women had done so much to help build other public buildings and temples that they had no means to build one for the Relief Society. President C. O. Card had said when they lacked the means to go on with the Logan Temple and the men were to be discharged because there was no means to pay them for their work, Sister Jane S. Richards raised five hundred dollars in the Relief Society of Weber County to keep the men working, and that stands as a memento to the sisters forever. Vice President Sarah M. Kimball confined her remarks to the subject of a house for the Society. She felt it a humiliation to be without a place of our own; we had contributed to all public places and at all times. Now we want to have a house and we want land to build it on and it should be in the shadow of the temple. It should be a place to receive strangers in when they come, a place where letters can be written" from and information given, I think we should vote on this matter, whether you representative women want this building or not; we want to put it to vote. Sister Kimball told the sisters what Joseph Smith had said in Nauvoo to the sisters of the Society there and had given them a lot belonging to the Church and a house on it which could be repaired and made useful. Now, said Sister Kimball, I want to ask you sisters if you want such a building as I have described. The motion was put and the vote was unanimous. Sister Kimball added, if you want this proposition carried out, then see how much can be done. The interest in building a house for the Relief Society continued strong and money began to be collected, however through the next ten years there also ran the fear, expressed quite often by those dear, faithful sisters as once stated by Sister M. Isabella Home?"don't branch out too largely at once, there is not much to do with, and the Relief Society must care for the poor.? In view of this great financial responsibility which they felt was theirs, the money was not quickly forthcoming, but the dreaming and planning went on. Their plans called for kitchens, pantries, banqueting hall, cooking utensils, a furnace and closets and a room for the janitor, and offices upstairs, "with library and bureau of information, that will be in the best sense educational, and be open to all members of the society, and where lectures may be given by distinguished professors in all branches of science, art and literature, and on general topics." In 1900, the Young Ladies Mutual Improvement Association and the Primary Association joined forces with the Relief Society with the hope that together the three could raise enough money for a suitable woman's building. March 1901, The matter was presented to President Lorenzo Snow who, in was reported to have said: The women must have twenty thousand dollars before commencing the house; in fact, before we could put a spade in the ground or have the land measured off, and when we had that amount on hand he would give the deed of the land, and we could be as sure of it as you will of happiness when you get to heaven. In speaking to the Relief Society at an outing at Saltair, July 9, 1901, President Snow said in part: You who are present today are members of the oldest organization in the Church outside of the Priesthood. The Relief Society was organized nearly
