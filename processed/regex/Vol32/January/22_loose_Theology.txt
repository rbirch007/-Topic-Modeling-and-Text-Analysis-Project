Theology Church History Lesson 7?The Nauvoo Period Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, April 3, 1945 Objective: To study the major events numbered in the bright and dark years in and about the city of Nauvoo the Beautiful. THE bitter sorrows born in the struggle to establish the center stake of Zion in Missouri, served to throw the cause of the Church into sharp relief against political weaknesses of the State and Nation in which the kingdom of God was to rise. Little did the mobs of Missourians realize how they indirectly helped to "bring about Zion." The persecution which these unscrupulous ruffians, in fiendish delight, heaped upon the saints perfected a unity of purpose among the followers of the Prophet which God had sought, but failed to get completely during their rise to power in the days of Kirtland. For within a period of but little more than six years, a marshland, fit but for an abiding place of malarial diseases, leaving naught to recommend it but its site upon a beautiful horseshoe bend in the Mississippi River, was to shine forth a city, the like of which the State of Illinois had not known. A city graced with a temple of God whose white stones and spires were to catch the eyes of travelers for miles up and down the Father of Waters. Nauvoo the Beautiful it was to be called. The saints, now bound together in deeper love through common suffering, were to work this wonder as evidence of the fruits of the kingdom. The winter of 1839 found from ten to twelve thousand Latter-day Saints in a most pitiable condition upon the lands of Illinois. The hospitable citizens of that State donated thousands of dollars in provisions Page 51 and clothing to these suffering people. With the arrival at that early hour they laid the corner stone of the temple and heard the fulfillment of the revelation so given by the Prophet, much to the chagrin of their enemies who had declared, under oath, that these words of the Mormon leader should go unfulfilled.
With the coming of the summer of 1839, the future city of Nauvoo began to take shape above the marshy land. Blessings of the Lord, both temporal and spiritual, came abundantly. In August, seven apostles departed for England, from which place was to come a rich harvest from the missionary work begun by Heber C. Kimball and those associated with him in the opening of the British Mission. As a result, some three thousand souls came to Nauvoo by July 1, 1841. At that time, too, Brigham Young, who had been in charge of a permanent shipping agency in Great Britain, arrived with some of his brethren.
While the missionaries to England were abroad, the Prophet Joseph left his followers and made a trip to Washington to present before the officials of the National Government, there, the grievances of the saints sustained during their expulsion from the State of Missouri. Such had been the publicity of the crimes committed that the whole country had been made aware of the "Mormon problem." They now, too, held "a balance of political power in the State of Illinois" came the cry. It was upon this trip that the Prophet met and talked with President Van Buren, who at first listened to the story of the Church but, later, in fear of his own political life turned a deaf ear to justice saying, "Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you, and if I take up

LESSON DEPARTMENT 53 for you, I shall lose the vote of Missouri." In disgust, the Prophet left the "city of politicians." His trip was not in vain, however, for during his journey he spoke to large audiences about the cause of Truth. Edward Hunter of Chester County, Pennsylvania, later a presiding bishop of the Church, came into the fold as a result of hearing the message delivered by the Prophet at this time. With the winter of i840-'41 came a most liberal charter granted to the city of Nauvoo by the legislature. So broad were its provisions that great good for the Church and its people was seen by the Prophet. A day or two after this instrument of government went into effect, on February i, 1841, a university and a Nauvoo Legion were organized. The Prophet became the head of the latter, holding the rank of lieutenant-general. Newspapers sent reporters to cover the news of the "Military Prophet." Joseph Smith's fame now had spread to two continents. Publishers sought his word for printed distribution. The result was a short account of the founding and rise of the Church, as written by the Prophet, in which, succinctly, were put the "Articles of Faith," the subject of the Relief Society theology lessons for the past three years. As one reads these, he is impressed with their simplicity and direct expression of the power of godliness. "We believe" they state. Ours is a faith that leads on to an understanding of the will of God; not a religion of the mind that is shaped from the touch-and-go interpretations of his word by men. The year 1842 found the Prophet and his people at the height of their prosperity. The Times and Seasons, a noted publication of the Church, carried the gospel truths abroad to the world. On March 17th of that year, the Relief Society for the women of the Church was organized. Everywhere, the peace of beautiful homes and thriving industries made Nauvoo a haven of rest for the twenty thousand souls who had come to Zion?a blessing and joy this was to the heart of their Prophet, who prophetically, though, had seen the bitter darkness that lay just ahead for him and his people, even as he then stood radiant in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the thickly darkening clouds. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for our life in this day. 1. Were the Prophet here today what questions of a spiritual nature might you have liked to ask him? Read sections 129, 130. Perhaps, in part, some of the questions raised by the class will be answered. The thought here is to have the teacher and class come a little closer to the natural and direct way in which the Prophet enlightened his people. Read the two epistles written by the Prophet to the saints, enjoying them much as you would a letter. These were written during the Nauvoo period when he was forced to go into hiding because of his enemies. Here is as near a personal visit with this man of God as we who were not privileged to know him in life can come (Doc. And Gov. 127, 128).
