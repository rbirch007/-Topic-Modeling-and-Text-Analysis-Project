ODE TO CHILD PSYCHOLOGY Mildred R. Stutz I filled my head with a store of knowledge From doctors, pamphlets, hospitals and college. I studied eugenics, genetics, and zoo, I've reaped information wherever I go. I delved through psychology and child care. Vitamins, diets, clothing, and hair, Punishment, teething, and education, Corrective guidance and sanitation. My schedule told me just what to do, I fed him at six, at ten, and at two. A bath at nine-forty then sleep 'till eleven, And his cod-liver oil came strictly at seven. He was in bed by six?although he might shout, The door was closed tight and the lights were turned out. With such competent training, I can't comprehend Why it's all forgotten before he turns ten. He's the subject, the object, and source of my wrath. It's a full day's job to give him a bath. He crawls through the windows and slides down the stairs. His falsetto soprano rends the air. He bangs the door and swings on the gate. He kicks up the flowers, and comes to meals late. He teases, he kisses, he stumbles, he shouts, He questions, he answers, he argues, he doubts. I've finally concluded that it's useless complaining. For boys will be boys in spite of their training.
